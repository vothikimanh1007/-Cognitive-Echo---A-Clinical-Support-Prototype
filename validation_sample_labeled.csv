1eou43s,1723299456,8/10/2024 14:17,stories,girl offered me a ride home after we met at the airport,"Was flying back from a bachelor party and waiting at the gate to board. This girl approached me after I noticed her looking at me and she then comes over and asks a question about the boarding order. She was pretty bubbly with me and I felt a bit of a vibe. Didn’t think too much of it and continued to mind my own business. 

Eventually I make my way onto the plane as one of the last to board. It’s assigned seating and who is sitting right next to me. That’s right. Now this is starting to feel like a romcom. 

I sit down and we immediately start chatting and hitting it off. Similar interests and she is going to college in my hometown. Quick flight but chatted a ton the whole way and she’s  asking me tons of questions. 

After landing we just kept talking all the way we from leaving the plane, through the airport, and to the curb. Once outside on she asks how I’m getting home. I tell her Uber and she then offers to give me a ride as her car is parked there. Gladly accepted and away we go. My actual first thought was “hell yea free ride.” 

The whole ride I’m thinking what all the dudes reading this are thinking. Do I invite her in? In short I didn’t. I asked for her # and we ended up texting for a few days and I asked her to get coffee. She politely declined and that was that. 

Even though nothing came of it it’s a great story but I’ll always wonder if I had invited her in would she have accepted? Or was she just a super nice girl with some airport infatuation. Also it should be noted she was a 20 y/o sophomore in college and I was 27 so I took that into account as well. ",2018,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1jq08cg,1743628920,4/2/2025 21:22,offmychest,"I am worried about my sexuality, think something is wrong with me, and fear I will be alone","This will undoubtedly be one of the hardest things I've ever written. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if I am [REDACTED_NAME] this to seek reassurance, get an idea of what people feel, or some combination of the two.

This fear started when I was probably 24-25 (I am 35 now). It was around the time the Woody Allen sexual assault news came out. I remember thinking that some part of me was like Woody Allen and that I could commit something like that. I don't know where the thought came from or why it came there, but I think I was feeling guilty about two relationships:

1. When I was a senior in college (21), I dated a 16-year-old girl (turned 17 when dating), whom I worked with. This was for a few months over the summer/beginning of my last semester in college. We got to 1st/2nd base to the best of my memory. I remember liking and being interested in her, and at the time (I swear to you), I didn't think it too weird. We worked together, and I felt more like a peer to her. That is not to say that I feel this way now- I have a lot of regret and shame about doing this, and for most of what I am [REDACTED_NAME] here.
2. After this, I had another relationship with a girl who was 17 and I was 22. To the best of my memory, this relationship lasted for around four months. This relationship was more serious in terms of what we did—while we didn't have sex, we probably got somewhere between second and third base. This was someone I knew who went to my high school, whom I met when seeing some friends/acquaintances there. This ended for many reasons, mainly because I was unsure about the relationship.

These two events mostly stayed out of my conscious awareness until the time mentioned above. I thought this meant that there was something seriously wrong with me. I also noticed that my crushes were usually, if not always, younger than me. I cannot remember how, but this led me to search all sorts of things and possible reasons why, and it eventually corresponded to an article about prenatal testosterone influencing the ratio of a person's index and ring finger. Basically, people have longer ring fingers than index fingers, and this ratio is more pronounced in men because they were exposed to greater testosterone in the womb.

I then started measuring my fingers and found that my ratio was abnormal. In other words, I wish(ed) my ring finger were longer. I think I also found an article that said that men with high digit ratios were more likely to be pedophiles. However, I now think I misread it and instead read an article that said they were more likely to endorse paraphilic tendencies. Needless to say, I would spend a lot of time measuring my fingers-- first with a ruler, then with a picture on my phone, and finally, I would make photocopies of my hand to measure or digital scans of my hand to measure them digitally. I can't tell you how much time I spent on this. Hours and hours. I also developed a severe anxiety being around children, my libido in general tanked, and I started checking to see who I was even attracted to. This all led to the point of me holding a knife in my living room and seriously considering killing myself for being this way.

Fortunately, I didn't do that. Another thing happened during this time, and I became extremely anxious about being in relationships. During this time, I got into an on-again/off-again relationship and became so anxious about whether this person was right for me. This ended badly (she basically cheated on me). The pain from this was extreme. I remember crying at 1 AM on some random street. I started smoking and was probably at my lowest point.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure how, but I think the pain from the relationship, a career change, and a long-distance move slowly took my mind away from the stuff around my sexuality. I moved halfway across the country to start grad school and soon met someone of a similar age. We dated for almost two years, with the same fears about it being ""right"" or ""good enough."" This relationship felt very safe and was my longest relationship to date; however, I felt something was missing, even though I didn't know what. I was attracted to this person, so that wasn't it, although sex was a bit boring sometimes. I also really didn't like her nipples (I know this is random, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to be as transparent as possible).

By the time I finished my master's and moved again for my doctoral program, I had ended this relationship and the stuff around my sexuality and hands was gone. I didn't think about it; it didn't worry me. I met various girls off-and-on for 1.5 years before meeting my next girlfriend, who was 25 when I was 28. I found her attractive and was pretty smitten with her the first few weeks, but slowly, the same anxieties came around this relationship. Mainly not feeling ""in love"" enough, worrying about fit, etc. We dated on and off for two years. I cared about and loved this person, and this relationship was one I look back on and think it ""got away."" I loved this person deeply and miss her.

After this relationship, I was single for a year and moved to finish my degree. This was when COVID came back again. I was struggling with isolation and also the ending of my previous relationship. I wasn't dating because I knew I would only be where I was for a year. I was struggling a lot with my mental health, but the stuff about attraction and hands didn't come up until the tail end of that year. I remember it very vividly. I was watching a British detective show, and one of the characters was attracted to a high school student and was the episode's villain. He was a stereotypical creepy guy, and I remember thinking, ""Well, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to that girl.""

This situation filled me with a lot of anxiety, and the process with my hands and attraction started, but in a slightly different way, where I wasn't worried about my attraction to children, but my attraction to teens, as well as intensely measuring my hands and looking at other people's hands. This continued when I started my first job after my doctoral program, and became so bad that I took a leave of absence to stay with friends and work on my mental health. I also knew I wasn't staying at this location long (it was a temporary job), and the constant moving and not having roots impacted me. I felt so lonely and empty.

I tried many things during this time (TMS, Ketamine, Psilocybin) with varying impact. I had a brief relationship with a girl (26 when I was 32) that went very badly. When I got to where I am [REDACTED_NAME] for my latest job, I had been prescribed prozac, and a lot of these thoughts had subsided somewhat. I also realized from that last relationship that I had some interest in BDSM, and found that age gap relationships were more accepted there. This provided an avenue for me to explore these themes some, along with other aspects of BDSM I had never considered. I think that sexuality was/is so anxiety-riddled for me that I have never allowed myself to explore. For a summer I said ""fuck it"" and explored my sexuality-- this included random things like going to massage parlors for happy endings, traveling to Europe and having random sexual encounters with prostitutes, and just hooking up with people. No, I didn't have sex with any minors, and the only illegal thing I did was pay for sex.

Around this time last year, I met my latest girlfriend, who was much younger than me (I am 35 now, she is 21), on Tinder. At first, I looked at it as another sexual fling, but we developed a relationship. I ended it for similar reasons as above, around doubting the fit of the relationship and feeling something was not right. We are still friends and care about each other a lot. During this time (once again), my thoughts around my sexuality and hands weren't there. Now that we have broken up, those thoughts have come back some.

That is my story to the best I can tell it in any sort of quick way. I am [REDACTED_NAME] dating and realizing I am [REDACTED_NAME] less attracted to women my own age (35) than younger women (have it set on my phone for 21 to 30). I am [REDACTED_NAME] interested in dating anyone younger than 21 because of the anxiety that it produces within me, and the lack of fit that is usually there.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] about my sexuality. I am [REDACTED_NAME] scared I will be alone for the rest of my life. I have never watched anything illegal, but gravitate towards the ""teen"" sections on Xvideos, as well as other taboo things (fucked up family, teacher) and more normal sections (redhead, asian, casting couch).

That being said, I find 15/16 year olds attractive all the time. Hell, I met a 13-year-old that I thought was cute and that filled me with a lot of dread. I obviously would never do anything at this stage of my life. I find 25/26 year olds just as attractive. It is really, really fucking hard to not be able to say this to anyone. So I am [REDACTED_NAME] it here.

1csbad6,1715743632,5/15/2024 3:27,offmychest,I finally realized why there’s no pictures of the sun and I feel like an idiot.,"My whole life it has angered me that no one has taken a picture of the Sun. Every time you see a picture of the Sun, it is in infrared, or an artist depiction, or black and white etc. and it’s always angered me. Why not just snap a picture of the Sun from space? Why is it so hard to just take a picture of the Sun so I can see what it looks like?

Well today I finally found a picture and it all hit me. The Sun is a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb so large that it makes up over 90% of our solar system. It is a nuclear bomb so big it’s been exploding for billions of years. 

The picture is just a white screen with a black vignette around it. 

I had never considered that something as bright as the sun cannot be photographed by regular cameras because the light just drowns out the entire photo. Not only that but you can’t see anything around the sun because the exposure makes everything around it black. 

The sun is a just ball of white light. 

Every picture is in infrared so we can see what’s actually going on under the cosmic beam of light blasting Earth at all times. 

I have complained to numerous people over the last DECADE, and even thought of conspiracies to explain why no one has taken a picture of the Sun. I have legitimately pondered this question for the better half of my life and I just realized today that the answer is so incredibly simple, that I have never felt this stupid before and I just wanted to tell someone. 

I am [REDACTED_NAME]. 

Edit: Yes I am [REDACTED_NAME] that there are indeed pictures of the Sun taken in the visible light spectrum. That’s the realization I had relating to the title. I realized the reason there was no pictures of the Sun was because I didn’t know that there WAS pictures of the Sun and I was too stupid to realize what I was looking at.

y1at1f,1665499276,10/11/2022 14:41,offmychest,Dad forced me to lose my virginity when i was 16.,"Dad forced me to lose my virginity wheni was 16.

First of all im a guy. Since i was young i was a very quiet kid, wasnt into footbal and baseball, didn't made much friends and liked simple things like walking and looking at animals and nature. And when i was 16 my dad was very concerned of me turning into a homossexual because he's from a very conservative family. He and my mother divorced when i was 10 but i kept contact with both. 
To ""fix"" this, he invited me to sleep at his place on a friday, of course i accepted and went to his house. Immediately when i arrived he offered me a can of beer saying ""first beer has to be with you dad eh?"", and i drank it with him. I dknt remember exactly but 5 cans in i was boozed up and he asked if i was a virgin, i said yes and he told me a friend of his was already coming over to fix that, i thought he was joking and played along saying something like ""haha lets see"". I did not wanted to have sex in any way whatsoever. 
A few minutes pass by and there's a knock on the door, he opens and she comes inside, a 40ish yo woman that smelt of cigarettes, she wasn't a hooker because i remember him talking about her.
At this point im so boozed that i pretend that she's not there, he tells me he ""has to go somewhere "" and leaves us two alone. She lit a cigarette and started chatting with me, i was almost one with the couch when she got close and deep tongue kissed me, and i kissed her back not really knowing what to do, she massaged my dick and it obviously got hard. She took my pants off and blew me, afterwards she was riding me while i was thinking what the hell i was doing, she told me to drink another beer to enjoy the moment and so i did. eventually she pulled me into his bed and we started fucking like animals because i was already fucked up and honestly i had given up.
A few minutes later my dad comes back and he fucking joins us i kid you not, he started fucking her mouth while i fucked her and vice versa. She was very loose and i could barely feel anything, after a few minutes she told me it was safe to cum inside her, so i rushed to do it and i did, the post nut clarity hit my drunken mind.
What the fuck i was doing, i could be at my house playing games or some shit, did i just lose my virginity to a 40ish woman that stinked of cigarettes? 
It was absolutely disgusting smelling the air after i came and hearing my dad moaning along with her.
I immediately left the room, i took a shower and forced myself to sleep in the guest room hearing him still fucking her.
It's been 6 years since and dad still brags about it to his friends saying ""no dad in the world would do that hahaha"", and i find it absolutely disgusting. 
I have never even chased after sex since because it makes me repulsive remembering that dammed day.
Nowadays I'm [REDACTED_NAME] interested in boys than i am [REDACTED_NAME]  girls, but not in a sexual manner.
Sorry for bad typos, it's the first time i say this to anyone.

TL:DR = Dad got me drunk when i was 16, called his 40ish yo friend to take my virginity, and so she did. He joined midsex and fucked her along with me, i came and all the beer got erased from my body as i realized what i had done. I forced myself to sleep and cannot even chase after sex today.",3115,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

162nzsj,1693135916,8/27/2023 11:31,TrueOffMyChest,I’m fairly certain I’m the fat woman in this video. This is my story.,"Link to the video: https://youtu.be/DRKcclNq02k?si=6Swv7yBX-7pd725K  
I haven’t seen any information about this video, but it’s the earliest instance I could find of this video, or GIF, in some places.   
To recap for those people who aren’t wanting to navigate a YouTube link or can’t watch it for whatever reason: there’s a very popular GIF out there of a fat woman climbing up an inflatable water slide, struggling, and eventually wiping out the kids in line.  
I’m fairly certain it’s me—the dates line up, the location looks about the same, the person in the black shirt absolutely looks like someone I know that was there when it happened. I would say that it is me, but I’m skeptical—I don’t exactly have any reference pictures to check, but I don’t think my ass was that big. At least, it’s not now. The body shape is a bit different, but I don’t have any images of myself from this time period to compare it to.  
  
First thing’s first—when this happened, I wasn’t a woman. I was fourteen years old. I’m twenty-five now. I’ve always struggled with my weight. I’m actually in the process of getting gastric bypass surgery now—I need 6 months of medically supervised weight loss. I’m on month 2, and have lost 30 of the 70 pounds I was told I needed to lose before I had surgery. I’ve seen some horrifically unkind comments about this, and, since I’ve always struggled with my weight. I haven’t been in the mental spot to come out and tell my story until now—I’m not even really sure I am, still, but I think a good sign is that I’m willing to talk about it, at least.  
Second off, this happened at a 4th of July employee/family celebration for the city we lived in at the time, and myself, the person in the black t-shirt and wet hair at the bottom, and a few other people who weren’t there in the frame were living in a group home. I spent the entire summer between 8th grade and my freshman year of high school in this group home.  
The reason I was in the group home was because at the time, I was still in the foster care system. My caseworker put me in a group home because I had a nervous breakdown seeing my abusive father at the last family review hearing—this was just after the trial for his abuse towards me, and no one informed me my father would be at the review hearing. I wanted to go to the review hearing because I kept hearing different stories between my GAL, my caseworker, and my mother, and I wanted to hear the truth for myself. They never told me why I couldn’t go, and I didn’t know my father would be there. If I had known, I wouldn’t have gone. I didn’t, I saw him, and this was just after I thought I would never have to see my abuser ever again. My caseworker took that as me being unruly and out of control, and she placed me in a group home for it—without the judge’s approval. When the next review hearing happened three months later, I was allowed to go to that, and I was told up front my father would be there. I didn’t have such a visceral reaction that time. The judge chewed the caseworker a new one and I was sent home immediately.   
We were there at the party not to celebrate, but to clean up after the BBQ that had just wrapped up. Once we were done, we were allowed to play around and hang out. I happen to love the water, and I knew I was too old and too big to go down those water slides, but I did it anyway because why not? That happened, no one was hurt, but people were pissed, I was embarrassed, and even moreso when I found the video a few years later. I’ve never talked about it until now.

1j072vd,1740747584,2/28/2025 12:59,self,"People with BPD should fix themselves first before going to dating market, your partner isn’t your unpaid psychiatrist","Read some insight about what happened to partners of people with BPD and their caregivers in this
[Harvard systematic review literature.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/s/ejrnoeXKrJ)

I am 32M, but let’s cut the bullshit, dating a woman with Borderline Personality Disorder is emotional self-harm. I wasted four years (2[REDACTED_PHONE]) trying to “fix” one, and here’s the raw truth nobody wants to admit, BPD isn’t just a disorder it’s a license to manipulate.

She weaponized vulnerability like a pro. Sweet? Intelligent? Sure, until her insecurities turned every conversation into a minefield. One wrong word and she’d shut down, sulking like a child. My empathy was her fuel. Every insecurity I confessed was later twisted into a blade to gut me with. I wasn’t a partner, I was a therapist, a punching bag, and an emotional hostage.  

The suicide threats? Classic BPD extortion. She’d dangle her life to keep me shackled to her bottomless pit of need. And when I couldn’t “fix” her fast enough, she monkey-branched to multiple married men. Not for love for supply. She treated people like utilities, one funded her, another stroked her ego, another absorbed her meltdowns. A fucking trauma dividend portfolio.  

Here’s the cold reality, BPD relationships are emotional Ponzi schemes. They take and take until you’re bankrupt, then move on to the next investor. Narcissists discard you, borderlines consume you. They exploit your pity to justify cruelty, all while Reddit coddles them with “uwu mental health” excuses.  

If you’re an empath, RUN. These relationships aren’t challenging, they’re parasitic. BPD abuse isn’t a flaw, it’s a feature. You can’t love someone out of a personality disorder, and sacrificing yourself won’t make them stable. It just makes you collateral damage.  

Downvote me, call me ableist, I don’t care. Save yourself the therapy bills and avoid this predatory neediness.  

To the “not all BPD” crowds:
Congrats if yours is medicated and self-aware. But the disorder itself thrives on instability. Defending it is like saying “not all landmines.” Some just haven’t exploded yet.



EDIT:

Leaving wasn’t an option. Every time I tried, she’d sprint into traffic, threaten to jump in front of trains, or slice her wrists for show (once even doing it for real, though not deep and wide enough to finish the job), I assure you it's scary.

The only way I escaped was by nuking both our reputations while I was away. I leaked proof of her affairs with married men, screenshots of her verbally abusing me, and bombarded her with daily messages for two weeks straight, not threats, just cold, blunt truths “You’re the problem. Fix yourself or rot.”

Eventually, she realized I had zero empathy left. Now I’m just the bad guy yelling ""SHAME"" at her face. Read some of [her behaviors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/s/GdRoS1idgf)

EDIT 2:

I’ve seen all the takes in the comment section, people with diagnosed BPD, empaths, haters, victims, even predators specialized in BPDs women.

Why don’t you all just… hug it out? Assuming you can tolerate a “long-term” hug without ""splitting"" and imploding.  

As for me, I’m out from this league.

EDIT 3:

I've outlined the risks of untreated BPD in relationships. So, instead of gaslighting and getting defensive in the comments, like my ex did, how about those of you with BPD share your symptoms from when you were undiagnosed and untreated?

That way, the rest of us can make informed choices and run like hell at the first sign to [save ourselves.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/s/0YGsZZpQxt) :)

FYI:

I have no animosity toward people with bipolar, HPD, ADHD, ASPD, schizoid, NPD, or any of those personality variations. A bit tedious, perhaps, but nothing a graceful retreat can't fix.

Death to who you think you are

Chapter one: The briefing

If we want to get the feeling of the beginning we have to start from the real beginning. I don’t remember the real age but I was very young. We shall say somewhere from one to two. I got to spend time with my real father and that leads down a bad path. From what I was told, being older that is. I had gotten soap in my eye and I cried nonstop and my dad hit me in the face. Now, this wasn’t some normal hit or love tap of being out of order. This was a young baby with now a fractured skull and an innocent child that now will start his journey in life on the wrong foot. My mother took my real father out to court over custody and needless to say he did not show and my mother had taken me home safe from something every happening again. We can kind of fast forward from this point to about the age of four to five. My life consists of my mother, my grandfather and my grandmother. My mom at this point had brought me around a lot of people and for me being a kid I didn’t know a lot, but we never went around someone I shouldn’t be around. But then my mother brought this guy around. We shall call him Lewis. he was a cool guy we got along well with and with me not having that father figure around it was cherished in a way that not a lot of people will get. Towards the end of me being my five-year-old self, my mother had gotten married to Lewis. It was a beautiful wedding and my mom was herself, everything just seemed right as a child, happiness is simple when you are that age I guess. We had lived in a small town in a house that my mother had purchased around the same time as the wedding, also along with that was a few brand new cars. Life was good as a child at least that’s what it looked like. The next few years flew past I had a new father and my mother was happy just everything was right. Now first thing’s first I was not a super poor child or I mostly got what I wanted being an only child. But as little as I knew things were going to change and I had no idea.

Around the age of ten is when things started to fall out of place and was a downward spiral until I started my new journey. My mother never had a good record with health but that goes for most of us in the family. She had suffered from numerous strokes and back issues due to a car accident that changed her life. Many hospitals and doctors’ offices had been visited with the journey I’ve taken with my mother. But we shall also get deeper into that. At this time in life, my mother was going through changes that I did not understand. She was sick and also trying to have a baby some time went on and things seemed well with my mother but something inside as a kid told me things were only starting and boy was I right. Around this time of me being nine to ten my mother had lost over ten miscarriages, I mostly don’t know the real reasons why that was but I’m sure if I wasn’t told correctly it was to make it seem like everything will be okay in the end. But many times I knew about having a sibling and sometimes it was just oh the stork or something didn’t make it, you know the things we were all fed as kids so we just didn’t ask questions. Finally, a miracle for my mother and Lewis happened. They got pregnant with my younger sister. That was a long 9 months with my mother for sure. But once my sister was born there were problems that I didn’t understand fully. She had been put on a machine that was attached to her heart, as a kid, this was terrifying to see someone you love in that situation because as myself-going through something life-changing likes that. At this age is when I started getting “Stuck in my head”. My grandfather raised me showing me to always be observant and have your back to a corner so no one can come up from behind you. At a young age, I was taught a lot in a short time. Because on top of my mother having issues and my grandmother was also sick at the same time with this thing called cancer that I had no idea what it was or how harsh of a thing it was. But at that age, I realized something was wrong. Wrong…  I started spending time with my grandparents more and more and I wouldn’t leave their side. That’s when I had realized these are my parents and my haven. Now don’t get me wrong my mother is my mother and I will love that woman no matter what I say or do. But she also knows what I mean by this statement and as for most of you know that’s just how having grandparents is. At this time I committed my time to my grandmother though. Like I had friends and stuff in school but nothing meant more to me than going to see her after school or on the weekend just honestly any time. I was learning so much from her how to cook, clean, do laundry or even just something like gardening. I was learning so much at such a fast pace I was blinded to the fact that this woman, my haven, my grandmother was dying and I had not the slightest clue. In this short time of ten to about twelve is where I learned how to become an adult very early. I was on a mission and I had no idea.

Chapter two: The blindfolded truth

In the time of me being around my grandmother, I have seen things people will never see in their lifetime and things that you couldn’t even process in your head. This section will be about my Grandmother and just my journey with a woman who was the purest person you could ever meet.

The time of realizing my grandmother was sick I picked up even harder on being there making sure she knew I loved her. Around when I did start to notice was when she started losing her hair. To me, she was still a beautiful woman no matter how she looked because her soul was so pure you could just feel it in the atmosphere around you. You can see the sickness in her eyes, you can see the thoughts, the worry and the pain. But she never broke character; she never let us know how much it bothered her. Until one afternoon she had gone into the bathroom. She had collapsed and I had heard it. I ran to that door as fast as I could but it was locked. I had no response from her but I knew I needed to get in here. I knew this was not good. Soon my mother and grandfather came to help. We got that door open and we had many smelling salts planted around the house and this was a time we had to use one. As my grandmother laid there hopeless, unconscious and looking lifeless my heart dropped emptiness grew inside my head and my heart and my soul started to feel like it was being torn out of me. I had to have been around the age of ten to eleven when this had happened. It was all like a daze, something that wouldn’t go away as the EMS got there and they had stabilized her enough to get her to the hospital. Across this time frame this was very normal she lived at chemo or the hospital or doctors. The chemo at this rate had been burning her because of how often and strong the treatments were. My grandmother used to sit there and not be coherent or not know who she was or sometimes the grandkids or her husband. We all understood though. We all knew this was going to be a long ride or this was going to end soon and none of us wanted that to happen. She was progressively getting sicker and there was nothing I could do about it. We moved forward and did all the things we needed to do for her and as a family we were one of the strongest families around no questions asked. One day she had gotten a call or was at the hospital or something along with that nature and she was told that the doctor that had done her test reading had read it wrong and she was given the wrong treatments of chemo. (Leukemia lymphoma) Fill with info!).

So for that time of around 2 years of treatments they were treating her wrong and with that kind of treatment being wrong they were just put here in a microwave and frying her. By this time there wasn’t very much to do. There was only one shining light of hope and it was this amazing doctor from Pittsburgh that took care of my grandmother. She trusted this man to save her life, as did we all. All within a month, we had to film a documentary with the attorney that was handling the case with my grandmother and that’s when we all kind of knew this wasn’t going to end well. After all the filming and stuff was done it had started to run into the holidays and man they just were not the same and you could tell. She had been in Pittsburgh at this time staying in a hotel room right across the hospital where it was filtered air and just everything was super clean. Her prepping had come to an end and it was time.

The family gathered at west Penn before the surgery. The drive was quiet but I knew everyone was just in their thoughts as was I. I had hoped due to the percent that she had told us of making it through it all. Which to us kids was around 80 percent; you know something to make it easier on the grandkids to understand. We all gathered in this waiting room and the room filled with silence for a bit you can just feel the tension in the room and that’s not what my grandmother wanted. She wanted us to be ourselves, talk and be a family and we did it just to break the ice. We all know my grandmother was the one to break that ice. We all talked and the time we had seemed so short but all said and done it was time to go. My mother and I wanted to stay just in case we needed to be here. But my grandfather was not having it he wanted everyone to go home and relax for the night. Remind you if something happens we are an hour plus away. Well, Lewis had calmed my mother down to the point where we all went home. The night grew old and sitting in my room thinking she will be okay I'll just call her tomorrow. Now, this is where the nightmare became a reality. I had woken up early to dead silence, my stomach turning and head spinning, it felt like a movie a haze filling the room but not just the feeling there is. I walked downstairs to my mother making coffee and I just remember looking at her and I said I don’t feel right something is wrong, she also had the same feelings. Shortly after the phone rang, it was like a horror movie. She raced to pick up the phone and it was my grandfather. Mostly all that was said to me was we needed to get the whole family there as quickly as possible. We scattered and collected the family and drove my mother to make it there in around a half-hour to forty-five minutes. We pulled in and I had my great grandmother in a wheelchair. We rushed to where we needed to be in no time. As we got to the final stretch to see her my heart was racing hands shaking. My heart slows as we approach

The room. I see these women in this bed that I had no idea who she was. I had thought maybe I had the wrong room or something. I just remember looking at the nurse and saying that isn’t my grandmother. She had gained a massive amount of water weight and she was attached to this machine with all these clear tubes running a tank and in that tank was the blood that was being cycled out and back in because her body couldn’t do it by itself. We were told she can hear but she cannot respond or open her eyes. A large part of me died in a matter of minutes. A cold shiver went up my spine rapidly into my brain and everything lost colors and feelings and it got really cold. We were pulled into another room to talk to the doctor about what was going on and what had happened and you can tell a lot of hate and anger went right to him in the room. But as we were explained she crashed the percent we were all told was indeed super low the real percent was only five and she had made it through that five percent chance. The issue was cancer got so bad it had taken over and this is where a choice changed the lives of many.

One thing I will never wish someone has to do is to choose someone if they live or die. The switch of never seeing someone again, seeing their smile or feel the love from someone again. While they made this decision I got to spend a few last moments with her to where she could hear me. Things no one has ever heard but us two. Those things didn't let anyone forget her. I was sorry if I didn’t say I loved you enough and that I’ll take care of grandpa. I just don’t want you to go but it will be okay and if you can’t do it by yourself it is okay to let go someday we'll all understand. At that moment she squeezed my hand with all she had in her and a tear fell from her eye. I knew it was time I knew this was the goodbye that I had nightmares about sleepless nights. Shortly my mother returned and we talked to her some more and then the rest of the family had said their goodbyes. As I sat there in my chair in the waiting room I waited and waited and then the real meaning of empty had filled me, a ring in my ear it had felt like I watched my heart and mind get sliced in half before me. The room filled with silence again and the ringing stopped…

She was gone but she had let go before the machine had been turned off and you could tell. Peace had filled the air for just a brief minute knowing she had never had to deal with the pain and suffering. But the anger and hate grew with the pain and my head was spinning and I just couldn’t believe it, I didn’t want to believe it. What seemed like maybe a half hour I was with my grandfather helping him collect her things and her from the apartment they were staying at once we had all of the things we had left. The drive had felt like hours and hours had gone by not much was said not many tears were shed either. We all had finally gathered at their house. Blank faces across the room, silent tears running slowly down everyone's faces. No one knew what to say. You can tell everyone wanted to comfort one another but you just couldn’t find the words to speak. Some of what happened is just a blur to me. The next thing I know we arrived at the funeral. Smelled of overpowering perfume, you can feel that certain people did not belong here. You can tell my mom was losing a grip on reality; she hadn’t eaten much, slept or even showered much. She wanted my grandmother’s funeral to be perfect and it was as perfect as it could have been. The day went on and it was our times to say our final goodbyes. The effect was kicking in at this rate the women, my mother, my grandmother, and my hero was gone. She would never get to see me grow up, graduate or even get married and have kids someday. MY life had felt like nothing but over. I don’t remember much at the time of burying her. I mostly stayed in the car. We had stuck around my grandfathers for a while every day in and out eventually he had won the lawsuit against the hospital and the doctor that had made the mistake of his life. I don’t remember the exact numbers but the set amount was a million dollars after taxes, lawyer fees and all that he still has a decent amount left. My mother and her two brothers received a good chunk of money out of this from my grandfather. Everyone did something good with it and did well with the money for the most part. But there was another turning point in life that we didn’t know was about to happen.

Chapter Three: The distraction

My grandfather is a hell of a man. That man would give you the skin off his back. He has also taught me about life and god and hunting just all the things a father would teach their child. My grandfather was in a car accident when I was very young. He was bedridden for some time; he worked down at the steel mill; he was one of the big guys down there. He claims to me that I was the reason he wanted to make it through the pain and suffering to live. He says I saved his life and I see that but little does he know he is what kept me alive all these years as a person. He was the father I never had. That man put his life into me and I’ve also done the same as best as I can. But when my grandmother had passed away he had felt an empty feeling that I will never understand and neither will anyone else in this world. It was his wife, his partner, his everything and she was just gone. He always had a good poker face but little does he know he taught me to be so observant that I can feel things in a matter of seconds I can feel things by looking into people’s eyes. But his poker face became a part of his life. He had gone to Vegas numerous times to play Texas Holdem and slots. He had gambled his pain away and no money in the world can ever take that pain away. You can’t replace that feeling no matter how hard you try. At this time I was trying to be around and be his grandson but I also was failing myself. I gave up on myself. So instead I started a new thing. I took my pain and turned it into healing others since I knew I understood people more than they thought I could do this. Well, an incident happened where I forgot my grandfather was in Vegas for weeks. We had talked briefly and he had some scrap in the back. I was going to clean up the house so when he returned it had some life back in and we got to make a few bucks because he didn’t want the scrap money. When I had gotten out back the door was inched open I had told my friend to go out to the front just to make sure they didn't run out the front if there was someone there. I searched everywhere I could and no one was found. His girlfriend he now had which was only like 8 months after my grandmother’s death. Which we will cover that soon also. But anyway she had walked in and had asked why I was there and I explained myself and everything went bat shit crazy my mother showed up, mind you she hated this lady. Some arguments happened and my grandfather called in the middle of everything and he wanted all the keys back whoever had one and none of us were to step foot on the property. A while went on and I and he hadn’t spoken. But one night I and Lewis got into a very heated argument and I had packed my shit and went to the haven I thought I had. Only to get there and have him look me in my eyes and tell me I’m not welcome there. At that point, I hadn’t had anything. I was failing out of school. My mother wouldn’t leave her bed. Lewis was out cheating on my mother because of how mentally unstable my mother was. Now at this time frame, I had been running around with the wrong crew. People who stole didn’t have a home. I was around fifteen to sixteen getting drunk and smoking weed and just not giving a care in the world what happened to me. 2009 is when I knew I had been around the wrong people. One night I had gone to a party just for a birthday with some food and a fire. Towards the end of the night, some kid had flipped the table and knocked everything off the table well when I had gone to leave I had picked up all the stuff being respectful and one of the items was a wallet. Well, I had turned it over to the owner of the home and went on my way. Several days later I had been with my girlfriend at the time and I had received a phone call from a cousin. Asking how I was and what I was up to. Now my mother had just gotten off the phone with me and had told me to come straight home. When my cousin had asked I hesitated a while and asked where. Well, she had said the school is only 100 yards from my front door. So we went… As we pulled in there were people flooded in the parking lot and the jungle gym all familiar faces. As the car came to a stop we started a conversation. The names of these men will not be named for this. They know who they are. I was asked if I had seen a wallet and I had stated yes because I did. I told him what it looked like but I did not open it. I had handed it to the owner of the home and he was there. He looked at me and said listen he’s telling the truth I told you leave him alone. Something was screamed in the background and after that it was black. I remember thinking to myself I was dead there was no way I was getting out of this. Eventually, I had come to and all I have seen was my girlfriend over my body and she was getting hit over and over and over again it had been over 45 minutes and the worst part about it is. I had a whole text written to my mom to come over to the school and call the police but as I was hitting send it when I got hit in my face. Eventually, we had gotten away and driven. I couldn’t move. I felt super drunk but I just kept hearing he’s dead. I just closed my eyes and next I was being helped out of the car. This burst of energy exploded in me when I saw she was hurt. I also ran in the house and went right for the shotgun that was always in the closet. But it wasn’t there. It was already loaded in the back of Lewis’s car shortly after my grandfather had rolled into the parking area. I had gone to sit in the back of his car and he had all of his guns with him also. Shortly after that, the police had shown up with 2 of the men who had assaulted me. The anger I had I told that cop and them you had 1 minute to get off the property or id kill all 3 of them and not think twice of it. He had gone to turn them in and an EMS had shown up shortly after that. I wasn’t worried about myself. I knew I’d walk away. I was more worried about my girlfriend at the time. Which ended up being a total joke? I had over 10 blunt traumas to the head, slightly torn iris; I developed TMJ in the jaw neck and back problems due to how much I was beaten. But something in me wouldn’t let it be about me. I just couldn’t let it be about me. That’s not how I was raised. Well, I never returned to school because all of them went to the same school and having to deal with 46 individuals in a small area was not ideal for me. Also yes 46 people now 3 days after that had happened to me. The person who had stolen the wallet returned it to the owner of it. So now something that happened to me was pointless I had almost gotten killed over some paperwork for the military and around 10 dollars in weed. Needless to say, the people who deserved what they got did get what they had coming to them. My grandfather and I started spending time together again slowly and it was something that I needed but also was just me masking my real feelings towards my life and the situations I was in.

Chapter Four: Meeting darkness

At this point in my life, I had slowly figured out how to deal with depression and what I can do to make time pass. I accepted that I meant nothing. So I focused on everyone around me. I tried to help fix my mother, my grandfather also looked over my siblings in the mix. I had a girlfriend different one this time. I was around 23 to 25 at this point. She helped with the things wrong in my head and she created this weird feeling in my chest like you swallowed a napkin which sounds stupid but it’s a good thing. She was beautiful no matter what with makeup, without it didn’t matter this girl was smoking hot to me. Her eyes and smile were pretty weird too but it just fit with me. It felt like I met the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. But here was the major problem with that. My stupid ass didn’t realize I was just getting worse by bottling up my feelings and not expressing myself because let’s face the hard truth of this world. We Men Aren't the Way We Should Be. It’s called being the stableman and the men that grow up without a real father have to be the man of the house for their mothers. But anyway sorry about that rant just if you’re a dude reading this I get it and believe me express those feelings it draws people closer. So anyway I drained this girl she tried so hard to help me and I knew she loved me but when I felt she was trying to step into an area that no one was allowed my walls came right up. So I didn’t trust her. I began to not care anymore. I pushed her away like I had done to everyone in my life at this point. But when I realized in reality I was losing her, I panicked and tried everything in my will to get this girl back. But needless to say, she was gone. The pain grew and my brain felt too big for my head, like if I didn’t talk to someone or do something I was going to explode. This next part is a hard one for me to write down on paper let alone put out there for someone to read so bear with me while I try to explain some things. There are a few times I had almost taken my life 3 to be exact. The first one was after this stunt I had pulled on probably the best thing that had ever happened to me. I sat there one-night drunk. I had around 2 bottles of Smirnoff 100 proof vodka blue cap clear bottles. I was down at the dam around my house. I was in my lifted piece of shit jeep just existing. All I could think about was I mean nothing. I have no one, my family fell apart, my girl left, I didn’t have a job, I didn’t live. I lay in the water and went under holding my breath hoping to just fall asleep. Something weirdly pulled me, it felt like the tide had tugged me, it felt like hey you can’t do this get outta here. I sat on that beach for 4 hours and cried my night away. I knew this darkness in my head was getting worse. I knew I had lost control. Several days had gone by and things got better again for a little while. I didn’t want to die but no one wants to die. We just feel that way. Days grew to months which led to me getting a job working at FedEx. Now at this time I was doing pretty good and had money for a car and a job. It was all falling into place where I wanted it to be. As I spent while at FedEx I loved the job and just hated who I worked for with the contractor there. I just bought a brand new car. 2019 Civic sport with all blacked out everything SI wheels the whole nine-man…I felt on top of the world. My grandfather was in my life everyday. My mom was doing good. She had moved and was living in Florida with this new guy who wasn’t so bad. Dude just needs to open up to her but that’s none of my business I guess, whatever mom. Anyway, life was making sense. I just struggled with the fact that my grandmother was not there to see all the progress I had made. Also, I wish the girl who had left me was there to see all the steps I made to make my life better. Now notice that the last part of the sentence I made my life better not myself. I tricked my head once again into thinking everything was okay. Well, the girl had come back into my life shortly but again disappeared which hurt just as bad as the first time. This leads me into round 2 the time I thought my life was going to end. The same spot I go at the lake to go into my head I was there just thinking about I was just sitting there and over and over again in my head I said if I’m gone all the problems tied to me go away. Mind you I never told anyone where I was but somehow a friend showed up and talked to me and realized how hard I was crashing and falling. I owe that man my life debt I can never pay but oddly he related to me and understood some of the pain. So once again we are back on this train of I think I’m fixing myself but little did I know this was only me getting right back into the mix. Several months have passed and I have gotten a new job. Working with driving again and tires now. Easy job I loved , boss , was awesome, worked with a friend and coworkers was awesome, so once again I thought I was on track again mentally and physically. Now I have a new girlfriend, a sparky character. I think I was more into the feeling of having someone than anything because I thought I loved this girl. But one night I was down bowling with my grandfather and I had stumbled over and caught myself feeling hot and dizzy . I felt like I was going to just drop dead. But I dragged myself to my car and tried my hardest to make it look like I was okay truth be I couldn’t see anything driving to the hospital I just kept saying I’m dying kind of laughed with my sense of humor like really dude stroke while bowling’s going to take my ass out like this is how I go out? Fuck me right now I haven’t touched this subject because it’s still hard to deal with on a small scale but that’s strokes I have had 4 in total by the age of 25. Also on top, I’ve had 2 mini heart attacks. The time I’m speaking of is the 3rd one I’ve had. So I get to the hospital walk-in and check-in, I wait about 10 minutes for someone to see me and tell her with half of my body working I think I’m having a stroke. I said to that lady I’m one of those people who aren’t in a rush when it comes to my problems, shortly after I fell to the ground. I opened my eyes and I was in a room with a laptop and the man was talking to me about some pill he wanted to give me. I thought I was dreaming or hallucinating. I just remember him running simple tests of lifting my left leg and left arm. My face was sagging and I just can only help to remember thinking all these times I wished I was dead and I tried to fix them and this is it for me. I can hear the man in front of me but it was kind of like the faint echo of a voice. He said something along the lines of whatever this pill was to clean the clothes in my brain but if they were not in my head there was a small chance I would die on the table in 15 to 20 minutes. I rejected and took a deep breath. I leaned back and I tape played in my head from when I was little playing in the kitchen with my shadow to the moment laying in this bed that smelled like death and after 6 days I had returned to work. Now the reason I think I had the stroke is kind of selfish but is the only thing that makes sense is the most recent ex, not the one who left me because I was fucked in the head but one more after her. I was so stressed out I had lost her and I was losing my job and just once again just my whole life crashed and folded on top of me. I felt like fucking have died over and over again one day after the next the problems pile the bills stack the car gets repo’d I have a room a bed and a computer. I was in my prison and I had no way out even though the door was unlocked. It was like I was drowning in air and no matter how hard I breathed in I was running out of time. I had one friend by my side and that was my choice. I had pushed everyone away. I started smoking cigarettes again pack or 2 a day depending on the days I was smoking weed again but sadly that was my way out. I spent 4 months high every day from the time I rolled out of bed till I closed my eyes but see I was mellow I was happy I found a form of an inner peace that let me talk to my ego and sort something’s out of course I started small on the list of things I wasn’t so much worried about like a job and a car and all that those things come over time and work and right now I need to work on myself. So I was in this haze for these months and I learned a lot about myself and things I didn’t know I could do. I was getting my creativity back and my head was clearing and I just enjoyed who I was again. But this was the beginning of feeling good and happy and just flipping my world because the journey has only begun.",3,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hex7ud,1592986728,6/24/2020 8:18,confession,When I was 9 I started the biggest fire my town had seen in 150 years.,"When I was 9 my older cousin (14) stayed with me and my family for a couple weeks. My cousin was a troublemaker and her parents had hoped that sending her to ours would keep her out of trouble for a little while.

One day while she was over I asked if we could go to one of our local forest areas and make a fire to roast marshmallows. When we got down there we made a little makeshift campfire out of newpaper and sticks all on top a rock. Eventually my curiosity got the better of me and I started chucking different things into the fire. Leaves, sticks, pinecones, anything I could find in the little area we were in. Then I wondered what a leaf on a tree would do if we set fire to it. My cousin got her lighter and lit a small leaf on a near by tree. I stared at the reaction in awe and my cousin set a group of leaves on fire. We laughed as we watched the fire slowly engulf the branch. Once the fire burnt itself out we carried on setting fire to bushes and branches and then we realised that the fire wasn't dying out. In fact it spreading.

My cousin started to freak out as she realised the fire wasn't stopping. The summer heatwave had made everything so dry that it was catching fire extreamly quickly. She grabbed my hand and we ran to the dirt road that was on the outskirts to the forest. But instead of calling 999 we just stood there. Watching it as it spread and spread and spread. My cousin almost called them multiple times but I kept telling her I didn't want to get into trouble so she never did. It had eventually spread so much that the fire department had trouble controlling it and had to order an evacuation of a nearby village. It was said to be the biggest fire the town had seen in 150 years. No one was hurt but it did take 10 hours to get under control.

It wouldn't have been as bad if hadn't stopped my cousin calling 999 when we first lost control. Both I and my cousin had promised not to tell a soul but 12 years on and my guilt is still here, I still feel terrible about it.

EDIT:

Ok I think now is a good time to do an edit for extra info that I think needs to be said.

Firstly, I am [REDACTED_NAME]. 
Secondly, as a kid I was emotionally abused. My parents had a God at me for very small things like leaving a cup out instead of putting it in the sink. And I mean my mum use to call me useless and a worthless idiot at least three times a day. It wasn't until my cousin came to visit that I was allowed to leave my house with out an adult (even though a lot of kids could play in the park and go out on bikes ect). My aunt thought my parents 'strict' nature would pull her into shape. I was always seen as a 'good kid' when in actuality I was just submissive and did as I was told. 
Lastly, the reason I won't tell the authorities the truth is that I have a very, let's say comfortable, job. The sort of job that holds all its employees to a very high standard. I have my own place. I have holidays booked for the future. I have a wonderful boyfriend who I love dearly and is helping me lose my submissive programing. If I was let slip that I had been the cause of one of the biggest fires our town has ever seen then I'd loose, almost, everything.

I have been stressing and dealing with anxiety my whole life. I put it here in hopes that it would lift a portion of the guilt and anxiety I have harboured for 10+ years. Thank you to everyone who has said kind words to me I really appreciate it. Also thank you to everyone who has made jokes about it all. I have never laughed as much as I have today. Thank you.",6537,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16nebzf,1695192528,9/20/2023 6:48,confession,I touched multiple girls inappropriately when I was in middle school and early high school.,"For quick context, I(now 32M) had pretty difficult childhood. Large family, untreated Adhd, bullied and targeted by my own siblings my whole childhood, emotionally neglected, and ostracized. Knowing what I know now, I was clearly in severe need of mental health care and therapy as I clearly had reactive attachment disorder on top of the untreated adhd. My siblings locked me in the snow for hours, would attack me and harass me and then I would deal with the same things at an extremely small school (300 students Pre K - 12th). Even knowing what I know now I still lay in bed some nights so angry and ashamed of myself. When I was 15, I had no control of my anger or emotions and so people avoided me. Then, a group of guys started talking to me one day. They pointed out a girl in our class who was known for dating around. I don't know how they convinced me, but they convinced me to walk over and grab her butt. One of them did it first to ""show me it was okay""... so I did. She laughed it off and told me not to do it again... but the guys laughed and told me she ""was just saying that"".. so I did it again later, I don't know if I was looking for their attention or I was just so over sexualized and lonely, but it went on for so long, it happened so many times and she so clearly wasnt okay with it.. then one day in weight class the girl I had a crush on let one of the guys touch her breast for God knows what reason.. so impulsively I reached up and did the same.. but worst of all there was a group of siblings my parent babysat... one of them was not much younger than me, but in teen years even a year is considered a long time.. one day we were swimming and i was tossing them around the pool and wrestling and I realized I was getting ""excited""... I took advantage of the ""wrestling"". It was never under clothes, and it never went past touching... but to me that doesn't make it any less awful that I would do that. I just lay here some nights and these intrusive thoughts pop up like ""remember that time you just did these things to these girls?"" and I get so angry. I pray that she never realized I did that and that I didn't scar her because I was such an awful person.. but even still... anytime I feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] good, and I've overcome my past... these memories haunt me and tear me back down...


Edit for clarifications sake and accountability: 
    So for starters. I think the main feedback I am [REDACTED_NAME] are the  comments about my adhd, other disorders, and the story of the guys. My intent was not to try and use those as ""fluff"" or a crutch.. I over communicate and have had posts on other subreddits taken down for being too long. So I didn't want that to happen and I obviously didn't explain my own perceptions to things properly. 
    My mental health issues are not my fault but they are my responsibility. The choices I made to assault these girls was still a choice I made to chase my own lustful desires and satisfaction with no consideration of them. The ""other guys"" encouraged me the 1st time it happened and with one girl. they did not play any part in it from then on except as witnesses and played no part in the other two girls I victimized... I think my state of mind was looking to it as a road map. Two things can be true at once, first that my life was difficult and thus there were many of Maslows hierarchy of needs that I did not recieve. Second that it does not excuse my behavior or justify it in anyway. But in my studies of psychology I've come across a common thread of seeking the ""purpose behind the behavior"". So I guess my quick typing without context came off as justifying, but that was not my intent nor my feelings on the matter.  

2nd. I want to apologize for not having the foresight to place a trigger warning for anyone else who has been victimized in the past or effected by actions such as this. It DOES NOT bring me any comfort to see other posts about how common this is. My hope for this post was not to hear other horror stories about this being a normal male behavior. I have been in therapy a few different times, however the times I have gone into therapy has felt directionless. Even still, therapist are trained to be unjudgmental, to remain impartial and unmoved. I posted this to get real, true responses. So thank you. 

To those who have offered words of support and understanding. Thank you for showing me that there are people out there who will understand that I strive everyday to get as far away from the person I was as I can. That I am [REDACTED_NAME] that person anymore and never will be again. This was what I needed, to know that others could see past who I was and understand that I despise who I was. That I could still be seen as a person by real people and not just a therapist in a chair being paid to convince me i am a person... 

To those who were critical and correcting. Thank you. I learned a while back the value of criticism. Having real people provide insight into these things helps to identify blind spots and mistakes.

To those who were raw. I appreciate your feedback. I understand there's nothing I can ever do to make it right. I can't take away the things that I did regardless of age or circumstances. I am [REDACTED_NAME] seeking any forgiveness or get out of jail free card. I am [REDACTED_NAME] try to manipulate people to coddle me or tell me what I did ""wasn't a big deal"" or ""normal"". I recognized my failures, my desire to be a better person is not dependent on anyone's forgiveness of ANY mistakes I've made past present or future. I want to be better because I recognized how horrible and disgusting the things I did was and how much hurt and trauma I could have (and as others pointed out) likely did cause. If someone is truly remorseful, they will change with or without forgiveness or acceptance, because it whats right. I can promise you that I will never be that person again, and I will continue doing everything I can to advocate against these behaviors.",1368,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wont be doing it any more.

Even the worst relationships have some good to them (otherwise, why would it start at all?), and when I read people's complaints about their relationships I experience the bad without experiencing any of the good.

Bad relationships also bring opportunities for personal growth, which, while it may suck, has some silver-lining, and is meaningful. Again, if I only read people's complains, I share in the bad parts of the relationship, but do not get to share in the personal growth.

1laafqn,1749802030,6/13/2025 8:07,stories,the fight that made me realize my sister was actually my mom,"hey everyone, i’ve never really shared this outside of close friends, but lately i’ve been thinking about it a lot and kinda want to share it here. i (26f) grew up in what looked like a pretty normal family, or so i thought.i grew up thinking my “big sister” was just that, my older sister. she’s seventeen years older than me. we didn’t look exactly alike but people always teased us about our matching dimples. my grandparents raised me like their own with super old-school Catholic.back then I didn’t know any of it. she was just my cool sister who worked two jobs and still somehow hand-sewed my Halloween costumes every year. She even made my prom dress herself, sitting up all night stitching the lace so I could feel like a princess when she never got to be one.my “sister” was the family rebel. she got pregnant at seventeen with me and my grandparents forced her to hide it. she wasn’t allowed to drop out so she finished high school while nursing me at night. she never went to her prom because she couldn’t find a dress that hid the baby weight. she used to tell me she stayed home to babysit me but really she just sat there watching TV while I slept in her lap. the truth came out in the ugliest way. i was sixteen fighting with my cousins over some stupid rumor that I was sleeping with her bf. they slap me, grab my hair, I was just crying because they are literally ganging against me. one of them yelled at me, “go cry to your whore mom!or should i say your big sis? idiot!.” i still remember how quiet everything got. they all scattered like cockroaches and left me alone in the yard feeling like my brain was splitting open.i ran inside screaming at my grandparents asking them what do my cousins. they lied at first but she came home from work in her scrubs, heard the yelling and just sank down next to me on the floor. she held my face in her hands and whispered, “i’m so sorry baby, i wanted to tell you so many times.”from then on everything changed but also didn’t. outside I still called her my sister so the neighborhood wouldn’t gossip. inside she was my mom. she told me everything, how my father was an older guy who got her drunk, how he laughed in her face when she begged him to claim me, how he blocked her on Facebook . i don’t think I’ve ever hated someone as much as I hated him in that moment. Btw he now plays ""best dad ever"" with his new fam.even with all that, she’s still the best thing that ever happened to me. when a girl at school called me a whore, i told my mom through tears. the next day she showed up in her beat-up Honda, marched into the principal’s office and made sure that girl and her parents apologized face to face. nobody ever talked about my family again.my cousins stayed weird about it for a while. some said sorry, some never brought it up again. my grandparents and I don’t talk as much as we used to but I’ve learned to forgive them in my own quiet way. btw i am [REDACTED_NAME] just typing this, my mom is the best thing in my life rn. love her to the moon and back.if you’re reading this and your family is sitting on secrets, i hope you find your truth too. it hurts but it’s worth it to know who you really are and who really loves you.",191,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obviously I am [REDACTED_NAME] with a lot emotionally, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to get on with my life.  It's hard, because I've fully dissociated from the event, and at times her (I am [REDACTED_NAME] on seeing a psychiatrist).

But there are things that have happened, that I just didnt expect... all of my friends stopped talking to me, no one calls or texts to see see how I'm [REDACTED_NAME] or just talk about their and my day.. I've not had a text.. or a call.. in weeks. Even my best friend.. the person who told he would always be there for me.. I've heard from him twice. He leaves me on read. And why?.. because apparently no one knows what to say to me.

So I not only lost a big part of my life and heart in losing my daughter, ive now lost another part of me in losing my friends. 

And I hate it. If it wasnt for the fact that I have 2 other kids.. I'd probably just disappear to somewhere else. 

If you read this.. thanks. I needed somewhere to put these feelings.

1i6yema,1737506851,1/22/2025 0:47,stories,"My brother married my ex. Now their messy relationship is spilling into the family, and everyone’s choosing sides.","I (27F) have a complicated family dynamic, to say the least. My ex-boyfriend Alex (30M) and I dated for three years, and during that time, he became really close with my family. He was charming, helpful, and honestly, my parents liked him more than I did toward the end of the relationship. We broke up amicably (or so I thought), but it still stung when, less than a year later, my brother Matt (32M) announced that he and Alex were dating.

At first, I tried to be supportive. Love is love, and it wasn’t like I wanted Alex back. But the dynamic became unbearable when they got married and Alex essentially inserted himself into every family situation. He has this knack for twisting conversations into awkward reminders of our past relationship. At family dinners, he’ll make comments like, “Oh, remember when we used to eat at this place all the time?” while my brother sits there awkwardly.

Fast forward to now: their relationship is a total trainwreck. They fight constantly and drag my parents into it. My mom confided in me that Alex has been pressuring Matt to buy a house he doesn’t want, and now Matt’s credit is tanked. On top of that, Alex’s behavior at family gatherings has been unbearable. He got drunk at my niece’s birthday party last week and made a toast where he “joked” about how he dated me first and married up.

I tried to stay neutral for years, but this is getting out of hand. My brother is visibly miserable, but every time I bring it up, he accuses me of trying to sabotage his marriage out of jealousy. Meanwhile, my parents are exhausted by the drama but refuse to set boundaries because they’re afraid of losing Matt and their future grandchildren.

I’m torn between letting this dumpster fire burn itself out and stepping in to tell my brother he deserves better. Has anyone else dealt with a situation where a family member married your ex? How do I handle this without completely tearing the family apart?",2941,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1l8ohfx,1749635092,6/11/2025 9:44,offmychest,I Don't Miss My Mother and I Do Not Feel Guilty About It,"Hi. I'm 22, a student, and a mom to a beautiful 4-year-old girl. I’ve never shared this part of my story publicly, but I think I need to finally do so.

My mother passed away, and when it happened… I felt more relieved than sad. I don't talk about it much because when people who knew her speak about her, they describe her like she was this strong, wonderful, fiery woman. And I just smile and nod. But inside, I remember the beatings. I remember the time she broke my arm with a metal rod because I burnt food. I remember the spade she used when my little sister stained her clothes, and she blamed me for “not watching her child.”

I was never at peace around her. Even when I was with my cousins, I’d sometimes tell them to be quiet just so I could listen for her voice, to hear if she was calling me. Because if I didn’t answer fast enough… I’d pay for it.

I’m angry at her. Not because she’s gone, but because she never got to be the mother I needed. I was scared of her. I never felt protected. I never felt truly loved. She was not the kind of mother I want to be.

Now, as an adult, it shows up in ways I never expected. I struggle with setting boundaries because I’m scared that if I say “no,” people will get angry and leave me. I people-please without even realizing it. I crave parental love from romantic partners, which I know is unfair to them and to me. I shrink myself just to be accepted. I walk on eggshells with everyone, even when I’m safe, like my brain is always scanning for danger that isn’t there.

And now that I have my daughter, that fear lingers. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of becoming my mother. I shout sometimes, and my daughter just laughs and kisses me, like she knows I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not to fall apart. I want her to feel safe with me. I want her to be able to tell me everything. I want to be her person, her safe place, the way I never had one.

Sometimes I cry when I’m alone, not from sadness, but from the weight of everything I never got. I don’t miss my mother. I don’t love her in the way people expect me to. And honestly? I don’t feel guilty about that anymore. She was supposed to be my best friend. My haven. And she wasn’t.

If you've ever felt this, this relief after a parent's death, or this fear of turning into them, you're not alone. I don’t know what healing looks like yet, but I know it started the moment I allowed myself to admit this truth.

12je7kd,1681285277,4/12/2023 7:41,TrueOffMyChest,"I struggled with Depression and Betrayal. But I'm healing, and I'm ready to tell my story.","**Trigger Warning: My story goes into heavy detail regarding Depression and Suicidal Ideation. Other topics I touch on are Emotional Abuse, Anxiety, Bullying, Self-Harm, and Trauma.**

Also, this is LONG. Sorry about that.

TL;DR: I struggled with Depression and trusted someone I had known for years with my innermost thoughts and feelings. He went to my abusive ex-boyfriend and told him about it. Because I cut him off, I got kicked out of my friend group and fell back into Depression. Now, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to say ""I have struggled with Depression."" in a room full of people.

Almost two years ago, my trust was broken in a way I had never expected.

Let me start from the beginning...

I met someone who would become one of my best friends while I was in Community College. We were close for six years, I considered him a brother. He saw me through changing my major. He was there for me when I was in an abusive relationship. He helped me sort through my feelings when I finally ended that relationship. He defended me when the same ex was stalking me. He celebrated with me when I got my Bachelor's Degree. He was there when I was rejected by a guy I crushed on for two years. When I needed him, he would come running. He didn't mind going on adventures with me at the drop of a hat. I could always count on him if I needed to get out of the house to talk, vent, rant, or rave. Before anyone asks, we have different sexual orientations. Translation: We were Just Friends. No romantic contact.

Or so I thought.

Summer of 2020. I can't put my finger on when my mental health started deteriorating. I stopped doing the hobbies I loved, I grew to resent the Zoom Meetings my Social Group provided to the point I stopped participating and made excuses to stop going to them, I became more easily irritable, everything and everyone save for a few select people could just piss off. I brushed it off, blaming it on missing school and my studies. Big mistake, I know. Maybe I could have gotten help earlier, maybe I could have recognized the signs of my declining mental state. No, it had to be an anxiety attack in the middle of the mall in October. With my aforenoted best friend there to see it all. I still remember wandering around the stores, seeing the distanced people in lines, feeling dizzy and disoriented, feeling paralyzed in my own mind. I still remember walking down the parking garage stairs, debating if I should jump off. I remember the deafeningly silent ride when he took me home. I was convinced he was going to abandon me and didn't want me around. Neither of us was talking. I think all I managed was ""Thank you.""

I still thank god I told my Mom everything, even if it was collapsing into her arms bawling my eyes out.

 My depression got worse. Sometimes I would go silent on my friends because I was convinced everyone hated me and wanted nothing to do with me. (Writing this now, I realize that he never reached out to me whenever this happened.) I listened to ungodly sad songs instead of my usual upbeat happy ones. I remember the times I would look in the mirror and not recognize the girl in the reflection. I would make posts on Twitter screaming into the void, expressing my pain, and geez am I glad my account was Private! (This was because my abusive Ex was stalking and harassing me online, which he was aware of.) There were times that I thought of ending it all, even going as far as researching methods, but I never went through with it. I have friends with Developmental Disabilities that I've known practically my whole life, I couldn't burden them with the pain of losing a best friend. I couldn't make their parents have to find the words to explain Suicide. 

I told this guy everything I was experiencing to the last detail. I trusted him with my life. He listened to my rants, comforted me when I was down, and validated everything I felt. His friendship was one of my reasons to live. I didn't want to cause him pain.

Come Spring of 2021, the dark cloud had begun to lift. I went HARD in my last semester of University, and it paid off with graduating on the Dean's list. We celebrated by going out to eat Italian. We also celebrated my first Full-Time Job. We went on an adventure to the City after I was rejected by my crush. I was getting better, and I really thought I was overcoming this heavy weight in my life.

The next thing I knew, he was dating someone. You would think he would've told me, but no. I found out when I Skyped him and he was in a hotel. Maybe he wanted to spare my feelings after being rejected? I don't know. Listen, I wasn't jealous, I was genuinely happy for him. I thought he found a real-deal partner. At least, until I got to know his partner better. His partner was pressuring him to move in together, which from what I knew about his comfort level, wasn't something he would be too keen on. I talked to him about this, and he confirmed he wasn't ready for this major step. It was my turn to listen and be there for him, which I did. I helped him tell his partner he wasn't ready to move in with him, which his partner didn't take well. I distanced myself from his partner, which I now recognized as bad news. My friend told me he was wary of this guy, and that he was going to be careful around him.

Then came a time when I needed him. My illness was acting up again. But this time, he was nowhere to be found.

He ignored all my calls and messages for a week. This wasn't like him, we would talk every day, and he would pick up whenever I called.

I come to find out that he told my abusive ex-boyfriend about my depression.

Yes, the same ex that stalked me and sent me threatening messages, which I went to the Police with. In fact, my friend was well aware of this, and was even threatened in these messages! When I finally got a hold of him, he told me that he had gone to my ex. He was upset because I was ""Slandering his partner"" who was ""A good guy"". He wouldn't tell me what he talked about, so I have no idea if he told my ex about my anxiety attack or my suicidal ideation.

I ended a 6-year long friendship, which was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. Honestly, it was worse than all my breakups combined. My depression spiraled out of control once again. I found myself back in that dark hole that I worked hard to climb out of. Once again, I was considering taking my own life. What was even worse was that I convinced myself that I was the reason all of this was happening, which got so bad that I scraped my arms up using a nail file. I only did this a couple of times, and I honestly can't describe how it felt (In a bad way). It hurt, don't get me wrong, and it's NOT a healthy coping mechanism. 

Part of the aftermath included being excommunicated from other friends who went to the same Community College. I noticed that mutual friends were distancing themselves from me and I was being excluded from events in favor of my Ex-Friend. One of the girls I was close to was talking to a boyfriend I had at the time about the situation. She lied about me talking shit about my ex-friend and his partner. Which I found very interesting, considering that she was practically begging me to forgive him when this first happened. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to say that he entertained these lies, despite hearing the situation from my side. This was the nail in the coffin for this girl. I told her that I was done with her friendship and called her out for telling lies to my boyfriend. (What the lies were, he didn't tell me.) She refused to take responsibility and remarked that ""If I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to make a big deal out of something so small, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] really being an adult."" 

Yeah, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a big deal out of broken trust that affected my mental health to the point I harmed myself and considered suicide.

Thankfully, this story has a happy ending.

I stopped talking to people in that friend group and started attending a Cooking Class in my Social Group almost a year ago. I met two others that I can confidently call my Best Friends. In fact, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] one of them. We've been together for almost 9 months and this is the healthiest relationship I've ever been in! I also have another Bestie who has seen me through this whole show and has been [REDACTED_PHONE]% supportive ever since I took her up on her offer to email her if I ever needed to talk. When I was betrayed, she took my ex-friend's place as my best friend, and she's not sorry about it. Honestly, she deserves this title. She is someone I can trust and someone I KNOW won't go behind my back. It helps that she hates my ex with the heat of a thousand suns.

Mentally, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a much better place. I've started painting and writing again! Which is HUGE since I stopped this when I got sick. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] regaining my sense of self, I can recognize the stronger girl staring back at me in the mirror. I can start to say that I have overcome Depression. Depression will never truly go away, but I now know that I can manage my illness. 

Recently, I was invited to speak on a panel at one of my Alma Maters regarding something I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about. Even better, I have the opportunity to speak among other experts in the field! I accepted the chance to speak about my experiences.

If the opportunity comes up, I will say that I have struggled with depression.

When I was betrayed, I was absolutely petrified to tell others about my condition. I felt as though the world knew about my struggle. My ex-friend told a story that was never his to tell. He told my most vulnerable feelings to a person who had no problem putting me down every chance he got for two long years. I took a chance in sharing my illness with my partner and my new friends. And here I am, taking another chance in sharing my story with you. But the difference is that I am [REDACTED_NAME] one telling you this story, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this on my terms. I am [REDACTED_NAME] the power back from someone who violated my trust. I have made the decision to do this because maybe I can inspire someone to reach out to a friend in need, someone to get the help they need, or someone to challenge their misconceptions about people with mental illness.

No, Hater-taters, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to hijack the platform and talk about my whole story. That's just going to take away from the other experts on the panel and just derail the whole thing. Sorry, not sorry!

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] conductor of my own crazy train, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] starting to realize that!",2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ocvv0i,1625309781,7/3/2021 10:56,stories,Gullible,"Ever since grade three, my friends and I could make Derek Zimmer believe anything. *Anything*. From Pop-Rocks and Coke make your stomach explode; to earwigs actually burrow in your ears (and one’s on your shoulder right now!); to the typical urban legend of the babysitter and the killer upstairs – and that it actually happened to someone in our neighbourhood.

The best prank we pulled on Derek had to be in grade 6, when we told him that everyone had to go into the girl’s bathroom to change because a toilet had overflowed in the boy’s. This was during gym class too and in our school the bathrooms doubled as change rooms. Geez, he didn’t even question it – didn’t even wait to see us go in first. We followed right behind him while he carried his spare set of clothes with a towel over his shoulder. We didn’t even need to shove him in; he just walked through the door and we locked it behind him and from then on there was nothing but hollering and shrieking from the other side. I got to admit, I still get tickled thinking about it.

After grade seven it stopped being funny – pulling fast ones on him all the time. But, like a bad habit, we kept feeding him lies and watching him fall for them over and over again.

I guess it didn’t help that he had sheltering, hovercraft parents. I mean, the guy believed in Santa Clause until he was thirteen, for Christ’s sake! And they kept walking him to school even though he lived literally just up the street. It wasn’t until Derek begged them, after being tortured by our sneers and jeers, that they finally stopped.

You’d think that they’d have tried to protect him by teaching him not to believe everything he was told. But I guess since they did everything for him, he just always needed someone else to make up his mind.

I don’t want you to get the impression that Derek was slow or something. He was actually a pretty bright kid. He wasn’t top of the class or nothing – and his math and science marks were pathetically low. But, if you spent time with him, you’d see he was actually very insightful, especially when it came to abstract stuff like morality and friendship and artsy stuff too. Oh yes, I was friends with Derek, even though I constantly tricked and made fun of him. Yeah…I was one of *those* friends. He would actually analyze our favourite TV shows, comparing the ones he liked and the ones he didn’t and go into really meticulous detail about why some were good, and some were bad. What made a joke funny and what didn’t.

At the time, even though I liked talking with him, I kind of thought that all this information was pretty useless – I mean, I just watched shows, movies and played video games for fun, not to write a goddamn dissertation. If Derek had any brains, I thought, he’d put more of his energy into his schoolwork. But now, looking back, it makes me wish our school had a Philosophy class or even an Arts program. I think he would have excelled, rather than constantly being stuck getting C’s and D’s. But we grew up in a small, frozen town in northern Ontario that only offered the bare necessities for a diploma. And in a town where most people work in the mines and spend their spare time ice-fishing and playing hockey, Derek stuck out like a sore thumb.

All the teachers seemed to like him, but you could tell they were pretty frustrated by how difficult he found the material. He was also a bit stubborn at times. For instance, you’d think he would have done well in English, right? Wrong. He shined only in the creative writing assignments but didn’t follow instructions and would never read the books that were assigned. The funny thing was, he was a voracious reader, always reading something. He just didn’t want to be bothered reading *Lord of the Flies* or *Of Mice and Men*. He just thought they were a waste of his time.

One thing that Derek excelled at, besides being a very loyal – to a fault – friend, was he was an amazing storyteller. When he got hold of an urban legend, or a dirty joke, or if something happened to him, he would tell it in such a way that we would hang on every word he said. There was no rambling, no “um’s” or “uh’s” – he always took his time and told the story perfectly. The punchline or the ending of his story was always clear and left us howling with laughter, terrified, or desperate to hear more.

More than a few of the stories Derek told us were uncannily frightening – tales of ghosts and creatures in our own hometown. Most of them I could trace back to some origin – usually Alvin Schwartz’s *Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark*. But there were also a few I had never heard of and could not find a source for. Whenever I confronted him with this, he would give me this knowing smile, his light eyes at ease, and say, “There are somethings that can’t be explained.” He would then pontificate about the other world and how everyone was able to access it if they just suspended their prejudices and disbelief. That was how he got “beamed” his stories. At the time, I thought it was bullshit. This was the only thing I had ever known Derek to lie about. Now looking back, I wish I had realized that this honest, gullible boy was incapable of telling falsehoods. And that what he was telling me was something *he* at least believed to be true.

Eventually, I got a bit jealous of Derek; I never had a good memory for details – aside from numbers and figures – and often when I told a joke, I’d forget an important part of the set-up and the punchline would fall flat. Or if I told an anecdote about something that happened to me that I thought was funny or exciting, after I’d finish, the listeners would just stare blankly, their vacant faces tacitly screaming, “That’s it?”

(Believe me, it took me a long time and a lot of effort to write this story as well as I have).

I was also jealous of Derek because of the attention he got from girls. Although he wasn’t very athletic, he was tall, fit and good-looking. And his gullible nature, I think, made a lot of them think he was cute. You know, like a lost puppy you just want to take care of. Unfortunately for them, Derek was too absorbed in his own world of Marvel comic books, Stephen King, Family Guy, and Doctor Who to ever take a hint.

This got really interesting in grade ten when Christie Blackwell, a preppy girl from the states, came to our town. Her family was from North Dakota and her father had come here for some administrative job at the local mining company. We didn’t know it at the time, but his position and his family’s move were only temporary.

Now, we had likely nothing in common with this girl, but both Derek and I were absolutely smitten. When you’re in a small town all the kids date each other’s sisters and exes, so I guess everyone was pretty intrigued by this new, pretty face from somewhere exotic – like North Dakota.

For a few weeks, she was all Derek and I could talk about. Some of our other friends thought she was cute too, but Derek and I were head-over-heels. I, however, never got up the courage to speak with her. I might have been top of my class and on the lacrosse team but, I knew what I was in the eyes of girls – a short, fat, sarcastic little boy with a sour disposition. Derek, however, he didn’t have the same cowardice I had. He actually went up to her during lunch break and talked with her!

I watched him approach, grinning from ear to ear, waiting for the humiliation and the peal of shrieking laughter from the other girls. But – she actually talked with him. She was positively radiant when he introduced himself and – I thought I was going to have a heart-attack when – she invited him to sit down at her table.

I admit, I was enraged. It wasn’t fair. It just. Wasn’t. Fair. For some idiot like Derek, with no prospects for the future, to have that girl. And what would that mean for me? Why would he want to hang around some loser when he had that girl on his arm?

Luckily, Derek – as I’ve said – didn’t take hints easily, so it wasn’t until a rumor had started about her liking him that he finally was ready to ask her out.

Of course, he told me first.

“Jimmy!” he shouted over the phone one night. I remember I actually winced from the receiver. “Guess what?” his voice blared at arm’s length. After placing the phone back to my ear, I asked him, and he told me that he had heard it from one of the girls that Christie liked him.

I felt a stone form in the pit of my stomach. Don’t get me wrong, I knew that I wouldn’t have gotten Christie. I just thought neither of us would. So, the fact that he got her, and I hadn’t, really burned my ass.

But then, I got an idea. An idea that would haunt me for the rest of my life.

“Derek,” I said into the phone. “She doesn’t actually like you. I overheard her and Jennifer (the girl who told him). They’re just playing a trick on you.”

There was silence on the other end.

Derek mumbled out a pitiful “But…” and I knew I had to pounce.

“Listen,” I implored, “if you ask Christie out on a date, everyone will just laugh at you. They’re just doing this to make a fool out of you in front of everyone.”

Again, silence fell on the other end. I could then visualize Derek with his head hanging down, all mopey like he sometimes got.

Then, I took it a bit further. Over the line.

“I mean, c’mon, think about it. You and her? She’s only been in our school three weeks and she’s already top of the class. Everyone turns their head to see her. How are you going to be good enough for *that*?”

I felt that stone in the pit of my stomach again, but this time for a different reason, after hearing Derek sadly mumble, “You’re right…”

Shamelessly, I changed the subject, asking him if we were going to still hang out this weekend to play X-box at his house but, his voice never came back to normal.

That night, I barely slept. I really felt like shit.

This was the first trick I pulled on Derek that made me feel that way. But it wouldn’t be the last.

It was grade eleven, when Lloyd (our other friend) and I took the pranks too far.

Lloyd and I had just gotten back our exam results for grade 11 Physics and, while we didn’t fail, these marks weren’t going to look good on a university application either. Plus, it was December, so there wasn’t much time left in the semester to make up for it. Of course, ole Derek wasn’t in Physics. Or Chemistry. Or Biology. He found some loophole in a technicality to take something called “Earth and Space Science” in grade 12 for his science/technology credit (don’t ask me how the Ontario education system works).

Also, around this time, Derek was getting super-obsessed with comic books and writing his own (report cards and postsecondary prospects be damned). At the time we thought it was really funny. He didn’t just draw the six boxes with stick-figures in ‘em and the poorly graphed word bubbles like most kids; he actually found out the proper format to write a comic book *script*. He kept trying to make us read them but – I mean – we didn’t know how. Plus, we were busy. You know, with school?

Anyway, Derek had this long bastard of a comic book script freshly printed from the school library – an adaptation of some classic horror story by Poe or Lovecraft, I think – and he ran up to Lloyd and me in the cafeteria all smiling, waving it at us, begging us to read it. And, remember, this was the same day we got our abysmal test scores back.

Now, despite our understandably pissy mood, both Lloyd and I resisted the urge to tear Derek’s head off. Lloyd said feebly, “Sure, Derek. Give it here. I’ll read it tonight.”

Derek almost leapt off the table bench, he was so excited. He thanked us and then was off to God knows where.

I turned my head and glowered at Lloyd.

“Are you serious?” I asked him. “You realize we have presentation for Chemistry to finish tonight, right?”

Lloyd blew out the side of his mouth.

“I’m not gonna read it, dude,” he said, his eyes cast woefully down on the crumb and grease laden tabletop. “I’m just pranking him,” he concluded, quarter-heartedly.

I sat there and stared at it for a few seconds. Then, another mendacious scheme started spinning in my head.

I knew that my Uncle Eric was coming over for supper that weekend. I told Lloyd that we would both tell Derek that my uncle worked for Marvel Comics and that he had read his script and loved it. And that he was interested in adapting it and giving Derek a job writing for Stan Lee. I’d invite Derek over to speak with him to discuss this “job prospect” at greater length. The funny thing was, my Uncle Eric was a belligerent drunk who’d mostly been unemployed between his time as a trucker and his time as a garbageman. But never – it probably doesn’t need to be said – did he ever work for Marvel Comics.

Lloyd and I both grinned and giggled like evil children. It was perfect. This way, we wouldn’t have to be drilled by Derek’s questions about what our favourite part was; he would be too preoccupied by the idea of having his work actually published. Working for Marvel Comics for Christ’s sake! An early Christmas present for our naïve young friend.

…I guess you can probably figure out what happened next. I’ll try to spare you the cringe-worthy details.

The next morning, Lloyd and I told Derek about my uncle and fed him our line. Derek beamed like I’d never seen before and bought it hook-line-and-sinker. Of course. That Sunday, he came over for dinner, all excited. Of course. My Uncle Eric was two-sheets to the wind, six gin-and-tonics deep and on his seventh that night. Of course. And when Derek approached him, asking about his script and what it’s like to work for Marvel, my Uncle Eric harshly barked what in the hell he was blathering about. Of course.

I promised Lloyd I would give him all the details on Monday. But seeing Derek, hunched over and defeated, like some withered daffodil – I just, had to look away. I didn’t laugh. Didn’t chuckle. Didn’t even smirk. All I could do was look away, that pit in my stomach turning to stone.

On Monday, in front of the school entrance, about thirty minutes before first bell and thirty degrees below zero, Derek stormed right up to me. Indifferent, seeing this coming and finding no despair, surprise or pleasure in it, I stood where I was, ready for him to hammer me.

Instead, there were no threats, no curses, no accusations. Just one question: did I lie about Christie Blackwell too?

Despite being exhausted from the endless stream of assignments and last night’s interminable guilt, I somehow managed the strength to slowly shake my head and mutter no. One last prank on Derek.

With that, Derek said nothing. And simply walked away.

At that moment, standing there alone with sticky icicles running down my upper lip from my nose to my scarf, I thought I was going to throw up.

The next day, I advised Lloyd we give Derek some distance at lunch hour. I suspected we were personae non grata.

But, to my surprise, Derek came over to our table. Stone-faced, without a word he sat down and ate. Lloyd and I glanced over at him then at each other. The three of us just sat and chewed in silence.

Then, after finishing his serving of oily cafeteria French fries, he told us one of his typically great, terrifying stories. His last.

“You guys ever hear about Melvin Sinclair?” he began, cryptically.

Fake-sounding name. Still, a pretty good start.

Lloyd and I both shook our heads, wordlessly.

“He was a student at our school. Way back, when it was run by the nuns.”

I later found out this part of his story was true. Our high school – Pendleton College – was once run by the local nunnery – but this was when it was still a residential school, with only abused, shipped-in Native kids as its student body.

“He’s actually the person I am [REDACTED_NAME] to write my next comic script on. I know you two won’t read it, but I think you should hear about him anyway.

“Sinclair was a funny kid. A bit stupid, you know? Believed anything his pals told him.”

This, of course, immediately rang a bell for both of us. Lloyd and I looked at each other knowingly. Still, we were hooked. At least, I was.

“He was also very poor with a sick father at home who couldn’t work. So, a lot of his friends could make him do things with the promise of money.

“So, one night, around this time of year – just before Christmas, all those years ago, Sinclair and his buddies went out onto Saul Laskin Lake. It was frozen solid then, just like it is right now. Sinclair got dared by his buddies to walk out onto the lake – see if he could make it to the other side.

“Now, Sinclair was afraid. Terrified, you know? Saul Laskin is two football fields long and three fields wide. Sure, he knew it had been frozen solid for three months straight and a jackhammer couldn’t make a dent an inch deep in it. But still, he was unsure. He never walked across ice in the middle of winter before. Never even put on a pair of skates.

“To his buddies, he shook his head, no. He didn’t care if it made him a chicken. He wasn’t going out there, risking falling through.

“So, his friends decided to sweeten the deal. They told him that if he made it to the other side, they’d meet him there, after walking along the shoreline, and pay him three-hundred dollars.

“Now, his buddies didn’t have three-hundred dollars, but they did have a thick wad of ten two-dollar bills. So, they slipped one into Sinclair ’s hand, as proof there was more where that’d come from. They both figured it would be worth it to see Sinclair fall through the ice or wet himself from fear.

“Again, Sinclair wasn’t too bright. He was also very poor, and his family was way behind on the electric bill, which was bad since this was one of the worst winters in Canadian history. Not to mention, Christmas was right around the corner. So, he took the two dollars as proof they had two-hundred-and-ninety-eight more and made his way across the ice.

“The two of his friends giggled behind their frozen-snot-covered mittens, egging him on, telling him he was doing great. Sinclair didn’t clue in though. He just kept going, waddling and swaying from side to side like a tight rope walker, terrified the rhino-hide-thick ice would give.

“Now, his two buddies didn’t want Sinclair to get hurt. Not seriously anyway. At worst, they were waiting for him to slip and fall on his ass, so they could laugh at him until their bellies were sore.

“So, Sinclair got sixty feet across the ice when his buddies at the shore heard a sudden crunch. A sharp, unmistakable sound. The ice had cracked. Saul Laskin was giving under Sinclair ’s weight. Apparently, the lake wasn’t so titanium at the middle.

“Feeling a sudden rush of panic and just a bit of guilt, both of them started hollering at the top of their lungs for Sinclair to get off the ice. To turn back. Sinclair didn’t turn around though. He didn’t even stop walking. He was determined to make it to the other side. To make that three-hundred dollars. Cracks in the ice be damned, his house needed heat!

“His pals on the shore watched in horror when Sinclair took four more steps before plummeting through the ice on the fifth. Unable to think, being dumb kids, they freaked and ran away. It took them ten minutes before they realized they needed to go get help.

“A couple of the teachers and one of the farmers from town came out onto the ice. When they got to the break where Sinclair had fallen in, they made a horrific discovery. On the other side of the hole, was a set of freshly frozen footprints. Like prints in the snow but upside down and inside out. They were glistening and raised, like a trail of swollen scar-tissue. And they headed to the other side – to the end of Saul Laskin Lake.

“On the shoreline, the five of them ran to the other side of the pond, coming to the very end, to find that the steps ended at a second gaping hole in the ice.

“Sinclair ’s body was never found. But the doctors were certain it should have been impossible for him to have walked that length of the ice without succumbing to hypothermia.

“Ever since that night, on the anniversary of Melvin Sinclair ’s arctic plunge, they say he comes back, still drenched and half-frozen stiff, looking for the three-hundred dollars promised him. And taking any unfortunate soul who dares wander across the ice, mistaking them for his two pals who had played that cruel joke on him, so very long ago.”

Lloyd and I stared back at Derek speechless, our mouths agape.

The silence was interrupted when two loud, chortling sophomores bumped into Derek from behind, making their way past him.

“This has got to be bull,” Lloyd insisted, rearing back from the table.

“Where’d you get this?” I asked, my eyes having never left Derek’s face.

“I told you,” he said. “It’s the basis of my next comic script, which you won’t read. There are some things out there that can’t be understood. But you can find them out if you just suspend your disbelief.”

I looked hard at him. He smirked.

“I heard it from one of the teachers and from one of the upper-class men last year,” he confessed. “Both of them told the story exactly as I just did.”

I was then fairly certain what Derek was going to say next. And I was right.

“The anniversary of Melvin Sinclair ’s disappearance is tonight,” he whispered, as though we were sharing state-level secrets. “I say we go to Saul Laskin after dark and check it out.”

Lloyd blew out his mouth, his lips making that *pffft* sound.

“Yeah, all right,” I said hastily. Almost automatically.

“What?” Lloyd blurted.

“I’ll go,” I continued. “Hell, let’s all go.”

“Great!” said Derek, over Lloyd’s grumbled protest. “Meet you both at the shoreline near Tenth and Mockingbird. Be there at ten, sharp.”

With that, Derek stood from his seat, carrying his meal tray to the metal rack and exiting the caf.

“Dude,” Lloyd spun on me. “What gives?”

“Look, man,” I offered Lloyd, weakly. “We did a really lousy thing to Derek. I think the least we can do is spend one late night with him on this little whim.”

“That’s crap!” snapped Lloyd. “This is your way of playing another prank on him.”

I shook my head vigorously, vexed by his charge. “No way!”

“Yeah? Well maybe this is Derek’s way of getting us back. Playing a prank on us. You ever think of that?”

“I doubt it. Derek’s not like that.”

Lloyd just shook his head, obviously miffed.

We didn’t say anything after that. But we both knew we were going to Saul Laskin Lake that evening to meet Derek.

I remember it was ten below zero. Felt like minus twenty with the wind-chill and even worse that close to the ice. The stars were probably out, and fully visible, but I don’t remember seeing them. I could barely see what was in front of me from my face being two-thirds buried behind my scarph and tuque.

I met Lloyd on the way there, about ten yards from the shoreline on Mockingbird, and he was likewise dressed as a winter mummy. As we got closer, we saw a figure standing upright, unfazed by the cutting gale. It was Derek. He was in his snow-pants and a parka but wasn’t wearing anything to cover his head. Just a pair of earmuffs. Bizarrely, he seemed completely comfortable out there, his flushed red cheeks the only thing betraying how cold he was.

“Well, here we are,” he greeted us, cryptically. A just as cryptic smile on his chapped, purple lips.

“What are we doing out here?” Lloyd growled, rubbing his thickly gloved hands together and bouncing from one foot to the other. “It’s freezing!”

“We’re here to see if Melvin Sinclair ’s ghost shows up,” I told him.

The look he gave me could have thawed Saul Laskin Lake.

“I never said it was a ghost,” said Derek, just over the wind.

The two of us stared at our guide into the other world.

“Then what is it?” I asked.

“A *zombie*?” Lloyd mocked.

Feigning ignorance, Derek just shrugged.

The three of us stood there, in the middle of December in Canada, staring at the frozen lake like three wallflowers around a dancefloor (an analogy that’s not much of a stretch for us).

Predictably, Derek broke the silence.

“How about we play some Truth or Dare?” he asked. I looked over and saw that cryptic smile on his now bluish lips.

“How about we play some Go-Home-And-Sleep-In-A-House-With-Central-Heating?” Lloyd barked.

Me, I couldn’t help myself.

“Sure,” I said. “Let’s play some Truth or Dare.”

“You first,” Derek pounced.

Ordinarily, I would have bickered back and forth with Derek to try to get him to go first, but my recently grown conscience forced me to accept this condition.

“Okay,” I said. I then looked out onto the ice, anticipating what the dare might be and not having any of it. “Truth.”

For the first time that night, Derek’s strange smirk disappeared.

“All right,” he said, his face and voice now very serious. “Yesterday morning,” my mind then immediately raced to that moment, regretting my choice for Truth, “when I asked you about Christie Blackwell,”

“Okay, okay, never mind!” I shouted over him, before he could even get the question out. “I changed my mind. Dare. Give me a dare. What? You want me to walk across the lake? Is that it?”

Without speaking, Derek nodded his head, that cryptic little grin reappearing.

I then looked back at the frozen lake. Derek hadn’t lied when he said that it was two football fields long. In fact, it was longer. 273.5 yards to be exact. From where we were standing, I could see only half of the ice, the other side swallowed up by night and fog.

“Okay, here’s a deal,” I said, trying to negotiate my way out of it. “I’ll go as far as where that fog starts. That’s just before you two won’t be able to see me.”

“No deal,” said Derek, his eyes colder than Saul Laskin. “You go all the way across, or until you see Melvin Sinclair, or you admit you believed my story enough that you’re scared to go out there.”

“What?”

“Or choose Truth.”

“I’m not scared of that boogeyman crap!” I exclaimed.

“Then why not go all the way?” said Derek. “You know that lake is perfectly safe for skating. It’s been frozen solid since October.”

“Because it’s stupid, that’s why.”

“Or because you’re afraid Melvin Sinclair will get you.”

“No, I’m not.”

“Fine. Then choose Truth. Answer my question.”

Astonished, I shot him an incredulous look.

“Man, screw you!” I cried. “You’re the one who’s so stupid that you believe that dumb story. You probably did hear it from an upper-class man last year. They knew you’d be gullible enough to buy it.”

I turned to the frozen pond, my eyes melting the ice.

“I’m going to go as far as that fog starts. From there, I’ll be able to see over to the other side. I’ll also be right in the middle so it will prove two things: One, that no one could fall through the ice when it’s this cold out, and two, that there isn’t some supernatural creature roaming around at night. I’ll prove to you there’s no such thing.”

Derek looked back at me. That strange smile disappeared again from his lips and never came back.

“I’m not gullible,” he insisted in a low voice. “The story is true.”

“Ah, up yours,” I said, walking to the edge of the shoreline and shuffling gingerly onto the ice. “Come on, Lloyd. Let’s go.”

“Me?” I heard from behind.

“Come on, you wimp. Let’s show this moron how stupid and full of it he is.”

The two of us waddled onto Saul Laskin. We inched our way closer and closer to the foggy middle, the thick air never seeming to thin out and recede like it normally would. Truthfully, I could barely see an inch in front of me; the whipping, cold air caused me to tear up and turned my tears to icicles on my lashes. But I was too angry to care. In my mind, I told myself I was going to prove to Derek what an idiot he was. In truth, I just wanted anyway to avoid telling him the truth about Christie Blackwell.

We were well past the center-point when I finally decided to stop. Lloyd was a bit ahead of me. I looked around. The fog was so dense. Even worse, I had to blink my eyes rapidly to break up the frozen moisture that accumulated on my lashes.

I roughly cleared my vision with my gloved thumb. And then I saw it. A hunched figure, just obscured by the fog, hobbling slowly toward Lloyd. Lloyd must have been having the same trouble I was, because he made no effort to run or communicate with the figure, even though it was practically right in his line of sight.

At first, I thought it was Derek. Thought he had somehow caught up and was trying to scare us. But I was wrong. I was very, very wrong.

I tried to warn Lloyd. To shout out. To ask who was there. But I couldn’t. The words were trapped in my throat. I was as petrified as the ice I stood upon. I stared, seeing the nearly naked figure come into focus. It was a man – or…what was once a man. The skin was pale, translucent, all the blue and purple veins visible. The hair was blonde – silver and slicked back, like the head had just been submerged in water. It looked like a cadaver that had escaped from the city morgue. Its bright coloured eyes resembled a pair of round, broken mirrors, and never once did I see them close. Not even blink.

Then, I…I heard it speak!

“*I did it…*” it muttered, hoarsely, the sound like the ruffling of crumpled paper. “*I did it…where is she*?”

The creature was mere feet from Lloyd, but he’d turned his back to it like it wasn’t there. He then lifted his head, one red eye open, and asked, “Jimmy? Did you say –”

Before he could finish, the walking cadaver shot a long, bony arm, grasping his shoulder with its claw-like fingers.

Lloyd looked around and shrieked.

“*Where is she*?” the thing muttered huskily. “*Where’s my baby*?”

Undoubtedly terrified, Lloyd tried to sprint away, only to slip and fall on the ice. The walking cadaver’s grip remained unbroken, causing Lloyd’s winter coat to rip. The thing pinned him, its grasping claws shaking Lloyd by the lapels.

“*You said if I did it, you’d tell me where she was*!” it hissed into Lloyd’s face. I watched, still petrified, only able to imagine the look of confusion and terror on Lloyd’s bundled-up face.

“*Where is she*!” the creature screamed. “*Where is she? You promised. You promised\**!” \* Its voice cracked on the last syllable.

It then started throwing Lloyd’s torso up and down, until the back of his head hit the ice with a shuddering thud. I cringed. It was like the sound of a bowling ball being dropped straight to the tiled, wooden floor. The thing then mounted him, clawing and punching at his lifeless form in a hungry frenzy. With its cracked, blackened teeth bared, the canines resembled a set of fangs.

I wanted to run. I wanted to help – to fight that thing off of my friend. But I swear, I – I couldn’t.

By the time that thing had stopped, I could see freshly fallen red droplets, steaming on the ice around Lloyd’s head. I knew then that he was gone.

What happened next, I can’t explain. The creature laid down on Lloyd’s supine body, putting its pale, grotesquely scabbed head on his chest, as though listening for a heartbeat. I then realized that the fog was thickening. There were whole plumes of smoke wafting up from the ice beneath their bodies. I realized when they began to sink, that the ice was melting.

The creature sunk down beneath the ice, pulling my friend’s carcass along with it. Once they had slipped out of sight, I heard the worst sound you could possibly imagine. The sound of the ice cracking. I looked at my feet and saw a deep gash, shaped like a lightning bolt, tearing a path through the ice beneath my feet and between my legs. Several mini fractures splintered off, creating a spider-web of icy shards.

My senses returning to me, I ran, falling and stumbling, back to the shoreline. I don’t know how many steps I made before I slid and fell through – and was completely submerged in Saul Laskin.

I don’t remember how cold it was – though it was freezing beyond imagination. I just remember the disgusting feeling of my clothes so",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
king in the water beside my skin– and the sheer panic blaring inside my skull.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remember how I was short and fat? Well, I also didn’t have a clue how to swim. I just floated there, under the water, not seeing a damned thing, my mind a riot of horrible scenarios and images.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As you would expect, I flailed in desperate mortal fear when I felt a hand grab at me and pull. Thankfully, the hand was pulling me upward, to safety. And it belonged to Derek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Jimmy,” Derek panted, after he’d dragged me up onto the surface. “It’s – it’s okay,” he struggled to say, as he too was drenched from head to toe. “Here’s my – my coat...p-put it on.”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He then laid his open parka over my body. Luckily, he had taken it off before diving in to save me. I’m sure now if it wasn’t for his quick thinking, I’d have died that night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“L-listen – listen to me,” he stammered on. His lips were turning a deep blue, as was his face. “My phone is in one of the coat pockets, call 9-1-1.”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“W-what?” I said, not understanding why he didn’t do it himself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Just do it,” he said, then turned and began walking in the direction of that creature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Wait!”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“I’m – I’m going to g-g-go get L-l-l-loyd!” he blurted out. Now, this is where I’d like to tell you that I forced Derek to stay with me. That I told him the truth about Christie Blackwell. That I apologized for the cruel joke I had played on him with Lloyd and my Uncle Eric. And for always taking him and his friendship for granted. But that didn’t happen. Shivering from the cold and my own fear, I just watched as he marched away, disappearing into the fog.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I took out his phone from the right pocket and dialed 9-1-1. I remember hearing the phone ring, the monotonous sound reverberating in my skull. I don’t remember anyone answering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last thing I remember is the feeling of my body growing warm. All the pain and fear evaporating with the fog. And then, there was blackness. Blackness save for a kaleidoscope of horrible images playing on loop in my mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I woke up in the emergency room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was told that the paramedics and fire department were called out. That they’d scanned the ice but never found Derek or Lloyd. I was told that I was lucky to be alive. Even luckier that I didn’t have frostbite and would therefore not have to lose any appendages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eventually, they got around to asking me why we were out there and what happened. I told them everything. Every last detail. Of course, they all looked at me like I was crazy. Some of them even thought that I might have gone into shock and asked my parents to have me undergo a CAT scan. I never did though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During my time in the hospital, three thoughts kept spinning around my brain. One, how grateful I was to Derek Zimmer for saving my life. Two, how amazed I was that his story was actually true. And three, why that creature kept asking for its baby, instead of for money, like in Derek’s story. I found out later that the story Derek had told us that afternoon was one of many legends concerning Saul Laskin Lake and that night. Some were about a man whose daughter had been kidnapped by a gang of thieves; that the man was thrown into the lake, his feet encased in concrete, after he’d paid their ransom. Some were of a mentally disturbed woman who had drowned her baby, thinking it was possessed by the devil. And at least half a dozen more I can’t stomach reciting here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perhaps the worst moment after that night was when I got a visit from Missus Calhoun, the principal at Pendleton College. She was in her early seventies, stout, with a tight, silver bob cut and a pair of owlish spectacles on her round, little nose. She sat down at my bedside, wearing her shapeless, riotously patterned muumuu, and asked me what had happened at Saul Laskin. I told her. The same story I had told everyone since waking up in the emergency room. When I was done, she just stared at me, expressionless, before giving out a sharp sigh through her tiny nostrils.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“This is what I think happened, James,” she began, a subtle disdain in her voice. “I think you dared Lloyd Apanowicz and Derek to walk out there on the ice. We all know how you tricked and tortured that poor boy since primary school.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“I think when the ice cracked, and your friends fell in, you panicked and came up with this ludicrous lie to cover your tracks, because you think we’re all as gullible as poor Derek Zimmer. Because you think you’re that smart and the rest of us are that dumb. I think you’re a cruel, immature, sociopathic little boy who’ll end up becoming a cheat and a fraud and spend his adult life in and out of prison.”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

125sodu,1680106459,3/29/2023 16:14,TrueOffMyChest,Lost girl,"Today 2023 I am 4 years into my recovery. I spent a lot of time covering and burying these feelings of neglect, hurt, loneliness, and hate for myself. I was addicted to crack/cocaine, I did cocaine before crack and almost hated it, it gave me the worst sinus infection and I eventually switched to meth. I was that kind of addict that could have died from the lifestyle alone. I traded my morals, self respect and care for anything I ever loved for one more hit. I failed rehab 3 times and did a little time in county. I was the only girl in county jail with the charge ""prostitution."" I look back now and I realize that the rehab time and all that bull shit was not for me to get better, if we are being honest if I recall one of the only reasons I went was to get out of the cold or because I had nowhere else to go. I wanted to get better but I knew deep down that I wasn't done with drugs, I admit everytime I walked into those doors of treatment my heart was not 100% on stopping drugs. I did try a few times to figure out why I turned to drugs and what was my deep core issue that I was covering up. This story explains finally why I am [REDACTED_NAME] way I am. Why I slept with over 20 guys by the time I was 15, including a married man. Now you can say what you want about me but I believe I was looking for love and affection. My innocence was taken from me at a very very young age and the influence I grew up around was not ideal for a kid. My mom and dad were young when they had me and now I know they got married because mom got pregnant, I think she was 19. My dad drank ALOT and he could get mentally, emotionally and physically abusive, if he got enough in him or drank whiskey.  Dad has a big heart and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only daughter, he is kind, generous, and a good dad. 

I took a lot of time in rehab to try to uncover my issues and try to heal but I got scared and ran every time. This time was different. In 2019 I was left by a guy I depended on, we were both homeless and my stuff was in his truck. One night he decided he wasn't gonna pick me up after work and it left me no choice but to do whatever I could to survive these streets. I needed to put my ducks in a row. By the time I realized he wasn't coming it was 10pm, I needed to find a bed, food, shower maybe, and more drugs to barter with. I ran the streets for almost 2 weeks alone with no help or someone to lean on. When I met Mel, I was looking rough, I had bruises all up and down my arms and legs, I was 90lbs, I haven't eaten in a day or two, and the best part I had the clothes on my back and maybe one more outfit in my bag. I had no underwear, one bra, like no socks, it was truly ridiculous. I lost everything I ever loved and owned 2ce over. I was Finally tired, finally just done. 

I met Mel in April of 2019, he was appalled when he realized how much I had lost and I still don't know what his true intentions were, maybe it was to help me or maybe it was to get in my pants, whatever it was I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it happened. I got clean with Mels love and support, no rehab, no NA or AA, I was done and I knew I had to stop or I was gonna die. 

These past 4 years I left state with Mel, we traveled for a bit and in this time I got to really think about what happened to me and why. It took some time for me to trust Mel and not think he was gonna leave in another state or somewhere stranded, he never did. I had nightmares, flashbacks, and bursts of anger for the first year. I really had to push through but I decided to write this story to maybe help someone that went through something similar. 

I was in a relationship with a 31 yr old when I was 12-13 years old.

A little back story: When I was growing up my dad was a carefree kind and just a free spirit. He was a functional alcoholic, he would get off work and drink anywhere from a half gallon to a whole gallon of vodka a night and get up at 6am and go to work. My mom and dad got divorced when I was young so I was passed back and forth but my dads was my favorite. I was allowed to do whatever I wanted and as a teenager I took advantage of that. Dad had a lot of friends and they drank too. Dad was close to his brother and he had a few real close friends who were around everyday of my childhood for as long as I can remember. The one in particular I will never forget. I was young, I mean like maybe 7-8 when (let's call him Jim) I met Jim. He was young, good looking and had been friends with dad from work. Jim and another one of dads friends lived together so they all started hanging out at my house. I had a friend over and she was a little older that day when Jim first came to my house. She was curious about him and I don't remember much about that day but I do recall Jim laying his head on her lap while she played with his hair. She gave him those flirty eyes and they sat there and talked. Remind you even though Jim was in his late 20s and my friend was maybe 12-13 at the time. Not long after I met Jim he got into some trouble and was sent to prison for a few years.

Fast Forward>>>>>

I was 11 when I found a letter from Jim to my dad. I wasn't sure if I was even allowed to read it but I opened it up and read it anyway. I will never forget the letters that formed the word ""tell wild child I said hi."" I don't know why I got curious, I actually don't even know what I was thinking. I spent days thinking of the letter, I guess I was lonely, I had to have felt some type of emptiness to write him back. I was 11 writing a grown ass man in prison for pulling out a gun on some guys who robbed him. Me and Jim talked about everything, he became my best friend really quick. I don't know why but I felt comfortable talking to him and telling him things that were happening with me, my friends, my boyfriend, and my family. He talked about his wife and 2 boys, he gave advice and was just very sweet, acted like he understood me and was very genuine. I now see as an adult he was manipulating me as a child but that little girl was craving for attention. We got to know each other, we talked all the way up to the day me and my dad and my friend were with us pulled up to the house after school and there Jim was sitting on our porch, just chilling. Thats when things got confusing and fucked up. I hate telling this story. It is so hard for me to realize what he was doing to me the whole time.. 

I don't really wanna get into the specifics. Um.. we Got close when he got out, He touched me multiple times, and also touched my friends. He gave me a ring at one point, Jim was 31 years old and I was 13 years old. It wasn't right and I hate that it went on as long as it did. He would kiss me when my dad wasn't around and tell me he loved me. Until the night it all ended. My friend came over while Jim was there I had a boyfriend over and supposedly Jim raped her when I wasnt in the room. There were hickeys on her neck and she was partying and drinking like a rockstar when I left her. I still have no idea what happened that night we even remained friends for a long time after and she never talked about it. I confessed to her that he was doing the same shit to me as he had been touching me for almost a year. She eventually did go to the police that night and she told them about me and everything that was happening. The police charged Jim with 2 counts of sexual imposition with a minor and 1 count rape he got 6 years. I always felt so guilty for sending him to prison, I hated that I had to tell I was ashamed of what he did to me but I was a child. When Jim had 6 months left in his sentence he killed himself in prison. I still don't know if that is true, how he died but I have had to go through years of trying to accept this in my past and live life to the fullest everyday without the reminder of what Jim did to me. I still can't tell you how it affected me, I guess it did in all kinds of ways and me wanting the attention in the first place makes me wonder. Growing up with my father letting me do whatever I wanted mainly because he only had my part time and I didnt think he ever wanted to be ""the bad guy"". He was more of a friend to me and when he drank too much it could turn bad quick. All of it is in the past and I have tried my whole life to forgive myself for my part in his death. I wanted to tell some of my story. it goes farther than this but i needed to get it out into the world.

I want to make this clear, my dad was an addict/alcoholic. He did the best he could with what he was given, even though he was asleep during this event and many others, he was clueless but now looking back as a recovering addict that it wasn't my dads fault. We trusted this man, he was a close family friend for many many years. We never thought that he would target 3 teenage girls. I thought the man really cared about me and I believed what he told me. 

Years later I changed schools my sophomore year and was in a small class with 2 girls and this geeky guy. (This was the year I found out Jim died) One of the girls, lets call her Ashley was telling our science teacher how her nephews dad was in prison and had just died, he was in the for 6 years for rape. She said that the girl lied and it was sad that her nephew had to lose his dad, she said that her Aunt Jims kids mom was distraught and in shock he could ever do the things he was accused of. I knew she was talking about me, I kept it to myself. What happened happened, I can't change a thing. 

This is me moving on and not being afraid to face any fear because I faced my biggest one. I will never stop healing but I can finally move on and let go. So Goodbye Jim.",2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a boy i knew from my bus who was in fifth grade was following me and i thought he was playing games with me and i remember running away to hide in a closet. the dream usually ends here but this time it kept going. 

i was in the dark room alone when he opened the door letting a small creek of light in and i remember how he looked at me before he grabbed my arms and held me down and lifted up my dress. you can imagine the rest from there but i woke up crying and having a panic attack at 3 am because all the memories rushed into me and i can completely remember the incident. this really made me realize that my brain was covering this up to protect me in some way my whole life and i don’t know what triggered it. i remember running to my mom screaming and crying after he let me go and her being so scared but i just told her that a boy hurt me because i didn’t know any better.

the mind is very scary but i’m okay and i am [REDACTED_NAME] now that the boy might have been sexually assaulted by someone and learned this behavior so i do feel bad for him too. this is all just so weird to me and i don’t know how to feel anymore. i don’t think i want to tell anyone

1kedsv2,1746342226,5/4/2025 7:03,self,Guy and girl mutual friends told me their very different takes on their breakup with each other,"I have mutual friends who are dating. I guess were, now. They broke up over this weekend. Both called to tell me about the breakup. I’m going to share both their versions of what happened to show the power of perspective. And really because… I’m not a gossip, so I have no one in my real life to tell. 

Context, they met four weeks ago, they’ve been on about eight dates. This is my best paraphrase of how they recounted their stories to me, abridged for clarity’s sake. 

**HIS VERSION OF EVENTS:** 

I knew right away I’d found something special with this girl and I had to lock her down. She talked about how her issue in past relationships was the guys not wanting commitment and being squirrelly about putting labels on things. 

So I planned a whole nice romantic weekend for us. I surprised her with a romantic trip into New York City. She’d never been and she said she’d always wanted to go. I got us a nice Air BnB. I got us a fancy restaurant. Flowers. The whole thing was perfect. 

We’re outside the restaurant and I asked her, “Will you be my girlfriend?” She says yes. It’s all good. We go in and sit down to eat. Having a great conversation. Chilling and it’s all good. Midway through dinner she goes to the bathroom. Comes back and says she’s not feeling well. I ask if she wants to go back to the Air BnB. She says no, she just needs some air. 

She gets up and full on leaves. Leaves the whole city. Leaves her suitcase of clothes. Just leaves. She sends me a text and says she wasn’t feeling well so she went back home. Calls the next day and said she feels like things were moving too fast so she’d have to not see me anymore. I don’t know what happened. She won’t meet up with me to talk about it. I don’t know if she’s insane or I am. You just can’t win with women. I did literally exactly what she wanted.  



**HER VERSION OF EVENTS**

It’s too bad it didn’t work out because I actually really liked him. We had seen each other for a few weeks and were just at the stage where we were talking about what we wanted. 

I told him things didn’t work out with [my ex boyfriend] because after two years together he refused to be clear whether or not our relationship was leading to marriage or we were ultimately just “dating” and that at my age I’m not someone who’s comfortable dating just to socialize. I don’t know if that’s what started this whole mess, but I thought I had been pretty straightforward. 

So he tells me he’s planned a trip. He doesn’t ask me if I want to go on a trip, he *tells* me that he has booked and paid for a trip for us overnight out of town. It seemed like he was trying to do something nice and I wanted to see where things could go between us so I said fuck it, let’s take the trip. 

I was pressing him for details as to where we were going, where we were staying, how we were getting there, and he wouldn’t tell me any of that which made me uncomfortable. I know he’s been a friend of yours a long time but that only means so much to me, I’ve only ever met him a handful of times. 

So I find out he’s driving us in his personal car to New York City where I’ve never been and do not know anybody, do not know the agenda or plan. But I agreed to go, I feel like I’m being over-anxious. We go to this shady and unhygienic Air BnB and it is a studio apartment with one bed. There’s a couch so I’m rationalizing “I guess one of us is going to sleep on the couch?” 

I set my stuff down and I’m freaking out internally because I’ve never slept with this man and I had no intention to do so that weekend. I felt played. I felt like he’d taken advantage of me. Nothing leading up to that weekend physically between us should have led him to believe we were in a place in the relationship where we were about to have sex. He knows I’m just coming off this awful breakup and wanting to take things slow, I was careful to be sure he knew that. 

So we drive to this expensive restaurant in his personal car. He makes a point to say he’s going to pay for everything. And my stuff is at some Air BnB I can’t even remember the address to.  At this point I’m starting to get legitimately terrified. 

Then as we’re walking in he asks me “Will you be my girlfriend?”After not even a month of seeing each other, after getting me in a strange city with my stuff somewhere inaccessible, and my only mode of transportation his personal car. And one bed to share that coming night. I called my dad to get me a ticket home and I called an uber and I pretended to be sick so as not to offend him. 

He seemed like a nice guy with genuine intentions but you don’t know how a guy is going to take rejection at that level even if it’s an honest misunderstanding. I felt really upset. If he knew what he was doing he’s disgusting and if he didn’t know, he hasn’t been listening to me at all. So the next day I called and told him it was over. I can’t imagine what he was thinking.

jayw88,1602674887,10/14/2020 11:28,confession,When I was a preteen I stole a towel full of quarters from my best friend.,"I was really poor. Like, really hungry all the time poor. My friend however had a nice middle class life. She and I would spend every single weekend in its entirety together for the better part of a decade. I loved her but I was jealous because *she never ate anything* and it was by choice. Even when I stayed the night I was going hungry. 

Anyway she had one of those giant parking meter “piggy banks” that was probably 4 foot tall and filled half way up with change. She asked me to help her count it one day and I eagerly agreed. (I have always loved counting change, even now that I’m in my mid twenties and financially stable). So we get to work. Quarters over here, pennies there, all in dollar groups, nice and tidy. 

She leaves the room for some reason, probably for the bathroom, and like an instinct I start gathering as many quarter piles as I can without it being blatantly obvious that a bunch are missing. I put them in my towel from swimming the day before and folded it up to look casual. I’m sure it was pretty obvious. 

Anyway I’m pretty sure she knew because she looked at the towel at some point and asked me when I was going home shortly after. I feel really terrible about it to this day. I was just so hungry back then and when my brother and I found quarters we’d always run to the liquor store and by cheap little Debbie snacks.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone that extended their kind words and experiences! I’m trying to reply to everyone that I can but I would like to clarify that I do not have contact with this person anymore. She went down a dark path and is now considered “dangerous”.

9tn5bc,1541186231,11/2/2018 19:17,offmychest,When I was 13 I kissed a 23 year old friend who I had a massive crush on. It fucked me up emotionally for years after.,"This is going to be long, but I’ll try not to ramble too much. Names are changed of course. 

I was 11 or 12 when I met Jacob and his sister Natalie. Natalie was 2 years older than me, but I was mature for my age, both mentally and physically, so the age gap wasn’t noticeable and we became friends. Her brother was 21-22 at the time, but he treated us like equals and we would all hang out together. 

Very shortly after meeting him, I developed a crush on Jacob. An intense, obsessive kind of crush. It makes me cringe now when I think back on it.

I spent a lot of time with the siblings, trying to get as close to Jacob as I could. Which wasn’t hard. He seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with me. The 3 of us were teaching ourselves German and had a lot of other similar interests. We had a good time together. 

Jacob and I spent a lot of time alone together too. Sometimes Natalie would get into a sulky mood and want to be alone, or her brother would annoy her and she’d storm off. I would stay and just hang out with Jacob. It was innocent, we were friends, not a big deal. But of course I was always thrilled to have one on one time with him. And internally I’d be lustily daydreaming of his lips on mine, his hands on me... you get the picture. I was obsessed. 

Looking back, I believe he had the same thoughts about me. Little things like how he’d get his sister to leave us, or ask if we wanted to go do something that he knew only I would want to do (like go feed the chickens, Natalie was lazy but I loved any excuse to go outdoors.) And he’d sit really close to me, often touching. He’d play wrestle me sometimes. I’d take his favorite spot or something else and he’d get playfully rough in taking it back. Oh, and he was always poking my ribs or back in order to make me jump and that would often lead to tickling as well. 

I didn’t realize it at he time, but he definitely wasn’t treating me like a platonic friend. Of course I desperately hoped that he’d see me as more than a friend, that we’d be madly and passionately in love forever. I knew about the age of consent, so I knew it was just a fantasy and I believed it was one sided. That is, until my family moved in with his. 

My family fell upon hard times when I was 13. Jacob and Natalie’s family had a farm with a small cabin they allowed us to move into. They needed to use the kitchen, since theirs was being remodeled. So they were in the cabin with us a good portion of the day. 

Ended up getting closer to Jacob. I’d help with all the animal chores and we’d goof off outside too. He’d chase me around for fun and tackle me when he caught up. One time I remember he had me pinned down, his face right up in mine. I thought he might kiss me, but eventually the tension broke and we went on like normal. That was about when I started thinking maybe I wasn’t the only one with a crush. 

There was another time I crashed my bike and the seat scraped up my inner thigh area. He was so concerned and attentive and bandaged me up. Looking back, of course it was inappropriate. But I thought it was sweet and loving and I was starting to feel like he liked me.

Well, things continued on like this for a while longer. I was definitely getting the sense that he liked me and there was a lot of sexual tension. I guess I thought that soon he’d confess his feelings and we’d be together despite the age difference. Of course that’s not what happened at all. 

The night before my family was moving to another state temporarily, we all watched a movie together in the cabin. I was sad to be leaving and just wanted to be be close to Jacob a little longer. So I pretended to fall asleep against his shoulder. Jacob decided to stay and let me “sleep” since I had to be up early to leave the next day. My mom went to sleep in the chair near us. Jacob fell asleep or pretended to. I gradually fell further into him. We were straight up cuddling at this point. Bit by bit, I “naturally” adjusted my position until my face was close to his. I don’t know what I was thinking. Maybe that he’d wake up and wouldn’t be able to resist me any longer. I read a lot of cringy teen romance books. I was too afraid to make a move though, I wasn’t certain I was right about him having feelings for me. So I continued moving closer in tiny increments until our faces were touching. I think he was slowly moving closer as well. And then one more move and our lips touched. Both lying still and “asleep.” After a few moments like this, I felt a little movement in his lips, and we started kissing. It was just a slow, very gentle kiss. Both of us still barely moving. I was afraid to push things too far and get rejected. He was probably afraid of being found out as a child molester. So neither one of us let things get heavy enough that we couldn’t still claim we’d been asleep and it was unintentional. I got a little braver and let my mouth open a bit. Our tongues touched briefly. Then the kiss tapered off and we slipped back to sleep, or the stillness of pretending to sleep. 

The next morning as he hugged me goodbye, he held on extra long and planted the lightest little kiss on my head. 

After the initial ecstasy wore off, I started driving myself crazy. Unsure that it had even happened. I started doubting myself. Thinking maybe he had truly been asleep and unaware. And then the guilt. Because I knew what I had done. I was conscious. What if he hadn’t been? Maybe I imagined his participation. I beat myself up over it for many, many months. And then eventually I blocked the memory out. I think this event is what caused a spiral of depression, self loathing and insecurities in my teenage years. 

My family came back just a month after the kiss and ended up living with Jacob’s family again for over a year. We never spoke of what happened. He was just as friendly with me and still a little inappropriately so. But nothing ever happened again. Eventually he got a girlfriend who moved in and we grew more distant. I was jealous and heartbroken. And I felt more delusional and pathetic than ever. By the time I was 15-16 I put him out of my mind. But I had a whole set of unhealthy mental issues and destructive habits in exchange. 

I’m about to be 24 and I haven’t seen him in about 7 years, but I doubt it would affect me. I’ve made peace with all this. I can see now that he was a pedophile. And while I did encourage his behavior, I was absolutely not the only one acting inappropriately. I don’t blame myself anymore. But until now, it’s still been an ugly, uncomfortable secret I’ve had to live with. Writing this out and sharing my story is just me hauling this dusty box of disturbing memories from a dark corner of my mind, and placing it on the curb.

If you’ve gotten this far, opened the box and rifled through, I wouldn’t mind a kind word or two. But even if no one finishes this lengthy story, I still feel better having gotten it off my chest.

I used to go out and play at the park at the end of my street, all the kids did the same who lived around there. We were allowed out after school until the street lights come on and that meant we had to head home. 

One evening in the summer, I was at the park alone, three older girls who I sort of knew (sisters of friends and their friends) they were 16 and 17, come up to me and started talking, I was young and thought they were pretty. I can’t remember what they asked me about but I do remember one thing specifically, the oldest of the girls asked me to get my penis out and show them.

She said that they would all kiss me if I took off my clothes, and so I did. 

One of them did give me a kiss on the lips, I thought I would like it but it was terrifying. One of them took a photo of me and was making lewd comments that I barely understood, the tone was really uncomfortable. I have always wondered what happened with that picture. It makes me feel sick. I put my clothes back on and went home. I’ve never told anyone, friends or family about this. 

I have had issues with letting people close to me ever since. It has been an incredibly lonely 17 years.

Things would get thrown, broken, etc. My mom once punched a hole in one of the paintings in the house. She also threw things in the kitchen, including a magnet I was really proud of making from some elementary school art class. My dad has thrown their mattress across the bedroom, broken lamps, slammed doors, etc. My mom seemed to always be more physical, but my dad was scarier. He definitely had more anger. Throughout my mid-teen years, divorce was thrown around nonstop, to the point I was so desensitized to it. In fact, over the years, I had become so desensitized to all the fighting in general, that I actually literally found a sense of comfort and familiarity in the fighting. It was all I knew for so long. 

Freshman year of high school, we had just moved to another district, so I knew nobody at my school. I felt so isolated and terrified. At the time I was dating one guy I had known in middle school. He was my first ""real"" boyfriend, and because of this I was naive and did not know what a toxic relationship looked like. Part of this was that at the time, I still was under the impression that my parents' relationship was normal. My relationship with this guy was alright at first, not that I remember much. Then one day, while I was at my great grandpa's house, my whole world was basically changed.

When nobody was around, my great grandpa ushered me into the kitchen with him, where he touched me. I was deeply uncomfortable, and I locked myself in the bathroom and cried in confusion. I told myself it must have been the ripped jeans I was wearing; I victim blamed myself. I immediately told my boyfriend. He seemed sympathetic and told me we could meet up later that week at the park between our houses. 

I was so vulnerable. I started telling him everything when I realized he seemed bored. He led me down an obscure path leading to a ditch concealed by these huge trees. I was reluctant but didn't know how to refuse. He started kissing me and then started removing my clothes. I tried telling him to stop and telling him that I was uncomfortable. He responded with ""don't worry about it"", ""trust me"", ""it'll be okay"". I think you can piece together just what happened. He then began asking me to roleplay with him over text, which I told him I was uncomfortable with. I played along as unenthusiastically as I could. I was disgusted when I later learned that he was showing the messages to his friends, and worse, to his dad. It was around this time I started to think back to my childhood. It was like a film was lifted off my eyes, as I realize what had happened to me when I was little. Both cousins, one from my mom's side of the family and one from my dad's, did things to me for years. The one on my dad's side of my family would build pillow forts with me and hide from my Nana, and would call me tiger and liked when my shirt was off. The one from my mom's side of the family would wait until my grandma was asleep to sneak me upstairs. I don't remember what we did, but I do remember it being sexual, because that's where I learned that ""down there"" feels good. When my cousins were doing this to me, I must have been six or under. Thinking about how young I was, I realized at this point that the clothes I wear don't really affect sexual assault or rape.

Things got worse when he started telling me he was cutting himself. He would never let me see the cuts, but he would send me pictures of bloody rags being held over his arms. He told me he did this because of me. It was my fault. Then the worst night happened. I don't remember why, but he told me he was going to hang himself from his bedroom ceiling fan with a rope he had hidden in his room; because of me. It was the night before Easter, I was dying eggs with my family. Secretively I was texting him, trying to keep a calm face in front of my family while simultaneously trying to convince my boyfriend not to kill himself. He told me that I killed him, that I am [REDACTED_NAME] reason he will be dead. After hours of pleading and a lecture from my parents for being moody and rude to them, he told me he got off the stool. He sent me a picture of his neck all red and scratched up. Somewhere in that time of pleading I had locked myself in my room and called the town police. I didn't know his address, but I told them the neighborhood he lived in and his phone number. I hoped someone would show up to make sure he was okay. Nobody ever went to his house. By the end of the relationship, I felt so horrible, like I had to punish myself. I got the idea of cutting from his ""cuts"". When we broke up, I told him that I cut myself and he became very angry at me and sent me another picture of a red rag on his arm, telling me I did this to him. By this point I was skeptical; every time I had seen him in person, his arms were spotless.

Regardless, one night my parents were fighting horribly. Though desensitized to the fighting at this point, their fighting became more regularly about me. I hated myself. I wanted to punish myself. I cut for the first time. It was the most painless one. It disgusts me, looking back, how much comfort I found in the fighting. There were times where I would hear raised voices downstairs and my heart would pick up and I would hone in real close to see if they were fighting or just talking loudly. A jolt of excitement would rush through me when it was a fight. I would almost feel disappointed when it was not a fight. It's disgusting. 

High school was the hardest for me, I was an outcast, I was bullied sometimes. I feel fortunate that the bullying was not that bad. I hear stories of kids being bullied and I feel like crying. I had nothing so severe happen. However, I hated high school and I felt like I didn't belong anywhere. I was nearly failing so many classes that I barely graduated. However, I managed to pull off graduating a semester early, just because of how much I hated it. I used the opportunity to work full time over spring to save for college. At my job, I got more attention from guys than ever before. I was confused, and I did things I am [REDACTED_NAME] proud of. I didn't cheat, but I led on multiple guys before finally choosing one. One was so angry, however, that he threatened to hurt my new boyfriend and me, and threatened to shoot his own ""goddamn head off with a shotgun"", his words. I reported it to HR and quit as soon as I could. 

Finally, I will close this super long story with college. I just got through my first semester at college, and life is looking up. I have a lot of trauma constantly being shoved in my face. I get panic attacks often, thinking I see someone from my past. I struggle to trust people, so nobody I've met at school truly knows me or what I come from. I truly enjoy being someone different to them. I know I can't keep it up forever, but for now I don't think any of them need to know all that personal crap. I've started working with a therapist on campus, and am hopeful for ridding myself of anxiety and depression and trauma. In the meantime I've learned self defense and have been teaching myself confidence I haven't had for longer than I can remember. 

If you read all the way through this, I truly appreciate the time you've spent. It feels good for me to finally get it all out, once and for all. If you have a story to share, I would love to listen. Thank you",3,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13vpue1,1685452028,5/30/2023 13:07,offmychest,Escorting made me realize we're all peasants,"I was over at some relatives' place yesterday, and these are white collar doctor and professional types who make like 150k-350k a year with master's degree and living in $1M+ homes. They ride my ass, as usual, telling me what to do with my life like get a ""respectable"" white collar office job, find a ""respectable"" white collar husband with a college degree, have a ""respectable"" haircut above my shoulders. I often felt judged for not making as much money or being as ""educated"". The most I ever made in my life was like 50k/year. I was washing the dishes for my aunt because she has hand arthritis from overworking them all these years (somehow they won't hire a maid), and I hear them talking about how expensive hotels are at $150/night. And in the back of my head I thought about the $500/night hotels that my clients stayed in while in town for business or pleasure, and who gave me couple hundred dollars in tips ""just because"". Or how someone spent $3500 on a date with me, and suggested I can get room service on his dime. Or how someone flew over to my city and was going to book a hotel where the cheapest room was $800/night just to see me, and then gave me the full $800 appointment fee for the inconvenience after cancelling our appointment on his end (so I never even met him). As a prostitute I've met men who have met the president, or who were personal friends of CEOs, politicians, and celebrities (or were themselves). If it wasn't for my escorting, I would never have come across men like this, nor seen their lifestyles. I would continued imagining that masters-degree holding workers making 150k/year with heavy student loans were ""rich"" and ""elite"". I am [REDACTED_NAME] particularly a head-turner either, and even my own clients aren't elite-elite, I have barely even scratched the surface of what real wealth is.

These doctors and white collar types think they're high ballers for making 200k a year and act all hoity toity though they wouldn't be able to maintain their lifestyles if they stopped working for their employer for even six months. They think they're better than the citizens who make 50k a year or 30k a year. No you dumb fucks, you're still peasants. We're all peasants who are fighting amongst each other and dragging each other down while there's a whole world out there of people who can spend 50k like it's a price of gum. People who can stay in $800/night hotels for months on end, spend $1000 on a dinner for two like it's going out to McDonalds, to them walking around in a public department store like Neiman Marcus or Saks is like walking around at a Dollar Tree or Goodwill.

To these whales, professional class workers like doctors and lawyers in their BMWs and McMansions are ""hood rich"", meaning they're not that impressive, they're only impressive to other peasants.

I don't look up at the white collar, master's degree-holding professionals as ""rich people"" or resent them (except their snobbery depending on the person). They're not really rich, they're peasants just like the rest of us. To look at doctors and lawyers as ""balling"" would be like when working class whites think native americans are balling and resent them because the latter is getting meager government benefits, or when tenants resent their landlords who mortgaged their 100k homes and view the latter as ""the bourgeois ownership class"" and imagine dragging them down Marxist style whenever the landlord asks for their monthly $300 rent, all the while ignoring the actual rich people out there influencing their lives from a distance.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] that special either. I only crossed path with the rich... all because some random rich guy decided that I, some random non-rich girl, was what he needed to get his dick wet that night. I was so nervous to see them and realized many were just as nervous to see me. And that despite their wealth they're still human and that nobody has it all.

1ey6in8,1724288874,8/22/2024 1:07,stories,"My girlfriend told me she was pregnant, So I had arranged to move all her stuff out behind her back.","If you only read the title, I might sound like a bad guy. But I'm [REDACTED_NAME].

I've known I wanted to be childfree since my early teens.

My parents didn't oppose me, but they did say I could change my mind. Since I'm [REDACTED_NAME] an only child, they'll still get grandchildren. When I was 20, I got a vasectomy. When I was 22, I met my girlfriend. I've been open about wanting to be childfree from the very beginning. I remember telling her about my vasectomy, but to be honest, I think there was already alcohol involved. So I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if she remembers.

We were dating for a year and a half when she moved in with me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] 25. Two weeks ago, I got home from work, and my girlfriend was standing in the living room smiling. She showed me the positive pregnancy test. Thinking it was a TikTok prank, I played along. When she didn't reveal it was a prank, I knew what had happened, but I continued playing along.

That night, I got up at midnight and started sending emails. I took a week off work and emailed my best friends the details, telling them to pretend they knew nothing and be prepared. The next morning, I left for work as usual, but I didn't go to work. Carl, one of my friends, was waiting outside. He had a cap and a hoodie ready for me. The whole week, we followed Katie, and on day 3, she met up with her affair partner. We followed them to a motel, and then Carl followed him to his home. The guy was married with kids.

We devised a plan. I convinced Katie to go to her parents' house to tell them the good news last Saturday. While there, I gave my friends the keys to my home. At Katie's parents' house, we had lunch with the parents and siblings first, and then Katie told them the good news. Everyone was happy. After a while, I got a call I had to take. It was my friends telling me they were done and ready. So I asked to make an announcement. I pulled Katie aside in front of everyone. I bet they thought I was going to propose. I started by telling how we met, how much she meant to me, and ended with, ""And that's why it hurt so much that you cheated on me and got pregnant by someone else."" The room was silent. Katie looked shocked. She started telling me it wasn't a funny joke. I said I'm [REDACTED_NAME] joking. The moment you told me you were pregnant, I knew you cheated. I got a vasectomy five years ago, and I go to check-ups every year. So if you're pregnant, you have cheated.

At that moment, her phone rang. I told her to answer it. It was probably \[AP's full name\]. You know, the REAL father of your baby. Probably wants to talk about you moving in. Not sure if his wife and kids are going to like that.

What happened was that my friends had loaded up everything of Katie's in a U-Haul and brought it to AP's home. When they called me, they were in front of his home for the final part. They rang the doorbell and asked the AP where they could put her things. He was confused, and they handed him and his wife a folder with pictures of him and Katie. And Carl said, ""Since OP is kicking her out, she needs a place to stay. We're just here delivering her things. And since you don't want the woman who is pregnant with your child to stay on the street, we assumed you would take her in."" AP called Katie yelling that she ruined his life and he never wants to see her again.

After hearing him scream over the phone, I said, ""Oh, so his wife doesn't want his mistress and their affair baby living there. So you'll have to stay here. With your parents""  
With that, I walked away, leaving a crying Katie and her confused and angry family behind. My friends brought the U-Haul with her stuff to her parents' house after the AP refused to accept it.

I went home where my sister was waiting for me. She knew everything. This was not part of my plan, but Carl knows me so well. I broke down and cried in my sister's arms. She stayed the weekend taking care of me, allowing me to grieve and process the betrayal.

4ad8op,1457964936,3/14/2016 14:15,self,"My perspective on why no one understands why Sheriff Joe Arpaio keeps getting re-elected and my story of why I left Phoenix, AZ.","Edit: Keep it civil. This is just a story. It's really difficult discussing racism because everyone feels different. The reason I wrote this is because this was an important experience to my life that I can relate to. That's all. 

Last edit: I am [REDACTED_NAME] longer going to respond to this post due to not respecting the first edit. The only reason I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it up is for the people who do appreciate my story. If you dont, please down vote and move along. It's quite obvious that racism with Sheriff Joe is a big issue. And if you have lived there for blah blah blah how many years, and you claim to have seen no racism, you're just in denial. The only place I've seen it comparable was Buffalo. Enjoy the thread or dont. I could care less.

This is going to be a long story. Buckle up buckeroos. http://m.imgur.com/VGijMZX

So for anyone who missed one of the top posts yesterday about the man who spent 4 years in jail for plotting to kill Sheriff Joe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Arpaio#Munnell_memo

Link of the story,  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] mobile otherwise I would try and link the actual post for referance. My computer is broken at the moment which would make this 1000 times easier to provide the OC of the thread. And as a warning, this is definitely about my perspective as a white person on racism. http://makeagif.com/CZ2nhf 

Honestly I don't care about race. It's never phased me. I could care less what color somebody's skin is. But I also fully admit that I don't know what it's like to be another race. There was a point where I was the only white kid in my class for [REDACTED_ADDRESS]raight when I lived in Buffalo, but nobody treated me different. I was too young to notice anything. And i think everyone else was too young to to care about anything like that.

Throughout the comments, the most reoccuring subjects were other horrible things he has done, and people asking ""How the fuck does this guy get re-elected?"" Last time I checked the guy has been elected 6 times in a row. 

Here is my story of how I packed my bags in a day, my experience with the different races of people I met, and why I left Phoenix, Arizona.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] living in one of the larger cities in Iowa. It really isn't all that bad there compared to a lot of other places, and if you don't live in the country, generally everyone gets along pretty well. Racism is really not a huge issue here. People seem to get along fine and are pretty tolerant. I can't speak for every single person, but it's not a common as where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] from. Originally I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Buffalo, NY. Racism runs insanely deep there. Cross the wrong train tracks or bridge, and risk getting stabbed to death. At minimum get jumped for being white/black in either races respective nieghborhoods. For anyone who isn't aware, nieghborhoods in Buffalo are extremely segregated, and I think it's gotten a little better, but not by much.

After a nasty break up, I decide there isn't anything left here for me and I decided my new life was out west. I ended up running into my ex girlfriend on St Paddy's day that same year. For someone who I was best friends and lovers with for 7 years, she was completely cold to me. It really struck me very deep. I remember going home and crying for about [REDACTED_ADDRESS]raight (I was completely sober) until I passed out. I woke up the next day, looked around and realize all my shit reminded me of her. Even my car, we bought together, and it was on it's last legs.

I had a friend in Phoenix who had been asking me to come live with them. I think they were pretty lonely and didn't have any friends. I called him up and told him I would see him in a couple days. He was very excited. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/xScBaNX

I put all my stuff on Craigslist for sale except for my smaller personal belongings. I took my car down to the dealership, traded it in for a much better car. At this point my phone is blowing up from the Craigslist ad I threw up. I sold all but one item in about a 3 hour time span. After I took the ad down, I called my friends and let them know I was leaving on short notice and if they wanted to see me, well that night was the night. I was actually suprised how many people showed up, considering I felt lonely constantly at that point in my life. Usually everyone was too busy. It was a Friday night so I guess it worked out.

6 A.M. the next morning, I hit the road. 35 very enduring hours and 2 days later, I arrived in Maricopa which is about 20 minutes south of Phoenix smack dab in the middle of the desert.

My new roomate hooked me up with a print job next to the Phoenix airport. So I started working and meeting people fairly quickly. 

I remember the 2nd day I was in AZ, my roomate sat me down and was like ""Okay dude. Things are different here. You have to understand that people here can be really hostile. People get shot on the highways all the time for even honking their horn at other people. You also need to make sure you don't get lost and end up in the wrong nieghborhood."" The entire time I was thinking that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Buffalo, and am very aware of how dangerous it could be, so I brushed it off.

It didn't take me long to figure out that I was definitely the minority. At least that's what it seemed like. Not a big deal. I was always good at making friends. Growing up, my father was always moving us around every 6 months or less. I think I went to at least 15 different schools growing up between New York, Florida, South Carolina, and Iowa. Making friends fast was no issue.

I'm a smoker, and everyone seemed like they smoked cigarettes. At least everyone came outside on break to chit chat. I ended up making some friends right away. One guy in particular. His name was Jose and he was in a death metal band. He invited me to some of his practices, which happened to be in the small town I was living in. So I made friends which a group of Mexican dudes within a week. They were real funny guys, never treated me different until I went to his first show. 

I ended up getting completely fucking shit faced hammered by the end of the night. I had a lot of pent up energy, and got a little too wild. But I remember one of the guys I was regularly hanging out with kind of avoiding me. I realized pretty quickly that he didn't want his friends to see he was hanging out with someone who was white. So I just went and hung out with the guy I worked with. We ended up going down to the gas station because we were both hungry. 

We sat down on the curb and started talking. I told him that his friend was avoiding me and asked him if it was because I was white. He kind of paused and said ""yeah, probably"". When I asked him why he told me that they're used to white people being really racist towards them. He said he could tell that I didn't seem like a person who didnt gave a shit, but it didn't change how things were. We also got on the subject of voting and he told me it doesn't matter. He said no one he knew voted because it didn't change anything. 

I can't completely say that my experience with hearing that a specific group of Mexicans believed voting didn't change anything, so they just didnt vote meant that's how all of the Hispanic people of Arizona felt. But I got the feeling it was a strong indication that was what was going on. It's not even a race thing. It's a poverty thing. Even my poor white friends don't believe it changes anything. It's just a lack of hope, and people's dreams were crushed by economic slavery long ago. That's just my observation anyways. 

One of my previous roomates was currently living pretty close to where I was in North Phoenix, so I ended up cabbing it back to his apartment. I came back the next day and my driver side window was smashed out. I was so pissed, I never had anything happened to my car like that before. He just looked at me and said ""Dude you left your car in a Mexican nieghborhood. What did you think was going to happen?"" I was pretty shocked because I had known the guy for 10 years almost and have never heard him say anything like that. I think he could tell I was sort of judging him by the way I was looking at him. ""Dude, that's just how it is here.""

Having that window broken almost got me killed. I got really lost and ended up 45 minutes in the wrong direction. I ended up grabbing a galling of water from a gas station. It was 127 degrees out that day. No matter how much I drank, it felt like I was sweating it out. I ended up pulling over 4 times because I got light headed.

I decide to focus more on work and started keeping more to myself after that. As I drive on the 10 everyday, I start to actually notice how many police there are. I mean, it's definitely a huge city, but these cops looked like they were carrying military grade shit. They all had huge SUVs (I don't think I saw an actual car the entire time I was there, all trucks). I saw some with assault rifles just chilling in their passenger seat if they were alone. It was really unnerving. I could have seen things wrong, I was driving after all. But they definitely let their presence be known. 

After a few months I begin to get lonely. So I downloaded Tinder and decided maybe going on some dates or something would cheer me up. To be honest I was hoping to meet a cutie Mexican 3.14. But all the girls that would match with me are white. I guess it wasn't that weird when I thought about it. I suppose in my own mind when I thought about the future, and having a family, I always envisioned my wife being white for some reason. Don't get me wrong, I would much rather have an Asian wife or something. So it made sense that other white girls would be going after a white guy. 

I ended up matching up with a girl who lived about 2 miles away from me. We talked and decided to meet up at her place. She lived with her dad. So we sat outside on the tailgate of her pick up truck and just talked. I could tell pretty much right away it wasn't going work becsuse she started bitching about how the Mexicans were taking all the jobs and that her dad couldn't make a proper wage because of it. I brushed it off because I wasn't sure if what she was saying wasn't a legitimate complaint. Was this guy getting fucked over? I didn't know, so I reserved my judgement. Probably because I was really desperate for companionship. I remember her bringing up Sheriff Joe. 

Right away, I was like ""that guy is a fucking murderer and should be put in prison for life for the terrible things he's...."" and before I could even really begin to rant, she shushed me. 

I was a bit suprised when she said ""uhm, you're in the wrong nieghborhood for that. Don't let anyone hear you. Honestly if my dad heard you say that, he would probably come out and kick your ass. You don't know what its like here. We never feel like we're safe. We have to compete to get jobs at lower wages because businesses don't care and want to spend as little as possible. He is the only one who is standing up and doing anything about it. Why do you think he's been re-elected 6 times?""

I was telling her about what it was like back home and about how I grew up and some of my friends. I told her my best friend was black. Her immediate response was ""ew your best friend is a nigger?"" I was completely shocked and that desperation for companionship melted away immediate. 

My immediate response was ""Excuse me? That so called ""nigger"" is my best friend. We've had our ass beat together, we've starved together. When I was out on the streets at 16, this guy barely knew me, and he taught me how to survive. He's more family to me then my actual family. You know it's not okay to be racist right?""

""Uhm actually yeah it is"" she said.

I didn't even hesitate. I just got up and got in my car and left. She sent me a message about 5 minutes after I got home saying she was sorry if she offended me. I told her that nothing was ever going to be fixed if you continue walking down the path of hate your father has so obviously laid before you. She didn't respond after that.

Unfortunately, that wasn't my last experience with racism. I noticed the more white people I met, the more I didn't like white people. I started to even feel ashamed of being white because I realized everyone viewed me like them. That I was this white dude full of hate, when i wasnt. This caused a lot of doubts in my mind if this was the place for me. 

It just kept continuing in this circle. Hear all the hate. Seeing all the cops. Watching the news and seeing all the people get murdered for such stupid reasons. Watching cops get away with murder. Seeing people pulled over and were almost always black or hispanic. Realizing that a huge portion the population was just old white people from all over moving to the surrounding areas and those were the people who were voting this guy in. And they love him! They think because he is so extreme that he's keeping the white people safe.

My roomate and I agreed that around the 6 month mark, I would find my own place.  I didn't want to live in a place that was at war with itself. It felt a lot like I was living in some midevil story where all the white people were the nobles and everyone else was just a peasant getting fucked over constantly by ""King Joe's"" men. 

Packed my shit and moved back east. 

As a side note, I have a friend who got a DUI and had to go to tent city. She was there for a month. She said it was like torture. They kepts her in tents, didn't feed her, didn't supply water in 130 degree weather until she was on the brink of passing out. Then they would nurse her back to health and then start the cycle again. She said she would never even step foot in AZ again. 

This was just my experience, everyone's life is different and experiences different things at different times. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to offend anyone here. If your from Arizona and love living there, great for you. Personally I loved the architecture and the music culture. But I just never felt safe there. Like everyone was the enemy. I thought about getting a gun since its so ridiculously easy. But my biggest fear was that I would have to use it. Either die in the process, or feel the guilt of killing someone else, even if it was self defense.

So I left, and I won't come back.

TL;DR-Lived in Phoenix, saw a circle of hate and fear, combine that with old people retiring and living there, that's how you get Sheriff Joe.",271,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1gl2c9f,1730910146,11/6/2024 16:22,self,The Democratic Party has nobody to blame but themselves. This is what the country deserves.,"I voted for Harris, but at this point I believe that a second Trump administration is exactly what this country fucking deserves, if for no other reason than to emphasize that the Democratic Party—to which I've lent my support for my entire voting career—is a pathetic disgrace of an institution that no longer deserves endorsement solely on the basis of their not being Republican.

The reason the GOP has successfully been attacking the Dems for being out-of-touch is very simple: it's fucking true. Election after election they have failed to give voters electable candidates. The only popular Democratic President since Bill Clinton was Obama, and he wasn’t even the candidate the Party wanted! It was supposed to be Hillary, and we all saw what a disaster that idea ended up being in 2016. Biden barely won in 2020, only because of COVID, and proceeded to deteriorate while leading an incredibly unpopular administration that domestically oversaw a hike in prices, and on the world stage oversaw the escalation of two major conflicts. Was it all Biden’s fault? Of course not, but it doesn't fucking matter in the court of public opinion.

Then, after Biden dropped out way too fucking late, with no actual input from any voters the Dems elevated zero-charisma Kamala Harris and expect people to mobilize for her en masse? The vice president inextricably linked to the aforementioned wildly unpopular administration? In what world did the Democrats expect that to be a winning strategy?

The fact of the matter is that Americans were never going to elect a female president, especially not a nonwhite one. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] saying that’s okay, but what I am [REDACTED_NAME] is that it's true. The Democrats were so blind to the reality of the ideological makeup of the electorate that they chose Harris, who was an abject failure in the 2020 Democratic primary, as the person they thought would beat Donald Trump. What absolute fucking IDIOTS.

They also have spent over a decade alienating white men, the biggest fucking voting bloc in America. They surrendered them to they sympathetic arms of Republicans without so much as a fight. Of course men deserve criticism for their behavior and privilege, but the realpolitik of the situation is that you can’t broad-stroke demonize and guilt-trip an entire demographic and then expect them to support you in elections. That was never going to work.

Not only did they alienate those men, they also condescended to and took for granted women and minorities. They looked down on and treated with disdain the huge bloc of religious voters. You can be as principled and technically correct as you want, but it doesn't fucking matter when your messaging alienates damn near everybody. That's what the Dems never understood, can’t understand now, and in all likelihood never will understand.

And guess what’s going to happen now? Trump is going to appoint nobody but loyalists, he's going to consolidate power and go mostly unchecked with a Republican-domiated Senate, House, and Supreme Court. Probably Ukraine falls, either through an outright loss in battle or through a shitty deal brokered by the notoriously Russian-sympathetic incoming administration. Say hello to an empowered Putin, who might have his eye on Poland, Moldova, Finland, etc. Probably things will continue to get worse in the Middle East. At the very least, if Trump escalates the trade war with China you can count on China growing closer with Russia, North Korea, and Iran. God help us all.

But do you know what else will happen? The economy will recover. Probably crime goes down. What’s that, you say? If the economy does improve it will only be because of policies implemented in the Biden Administration that have slowly made an impact? Crime rates aren't as high as people say they are? Well, you’re right, but it doesn't fucking matter that you're right because the average voter doesn't care. Condemn that voter all you want, blame whatever system you want, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter that you understand and they don't.

And while the standard of living is improving, even marginally, what do you think Democrats will be doing? Since they are terminally incapable of reading the room, they’ll continue to futility crusade again Trump, making him into even more of a sympathetic martyr. They’ll double down on the identity politics that have alienated more and more people each election. Academics will continue to moronically squirm in their silos of bullshit critical theory. All the while they'll be growing more and more out-of-touch with voters, and I frankly wouldn't be surprised if we never see another Democratic president. Maybe over the course of the next 20 or 30 years we will see the gradual rise of an economically conservative socially liberal third party that eventually takes the place of the modern Democratic party. But barring that near-impossible feat, I really think that we’ve spent the past year watching the great progressive experiment fail before our very eyes. And the Democrats have absolutely nobody to blame but themselves. Fuck it all.

  
EDIT: I'm [REDACTED_NAME] two comments I made, just to clarify in case anybody actually cares:

1. On my comment about female presidents:

I've been catching a lot of flack for the comments I made about Harris’ gender and race, so I’ll just say this here:

You're right that any sexist/racist would never have voted for her anyway. But subtle misogyny was one of the many popular appeals to grievance in Trump’s campaign even before Harris took over the candidacy and sexist language came closer to the forefront. The DNC should have been smart enough to see that, and then make the realization that whatever perceived draw from progressive voters a female candidate might get would inevitably be outweight by the risk of giving Trump more ammunition to rile up the men that make up such an important part of the base. It was a bad tactical move that didn't pay off, not even among female voters. It didn't work in 2016 and it didn't work this year, even though they put a lot less emphasis on it.

2. On my comment about white men:

I've been flamed a lot for this line, so I’ll just clarify once:

I think it was important to have the conversation about male privilege and bad behavior. I think it was important to talk about misbalanced power dynamics and the prevalence of sexual assault and violence. I think we should keep all these things in mind.

I do not think that you should use these issues to condemn men as a whole, because that's the kind of attitude that drives non-shitty men further away from the Democratic party, which is the opposite of what any political party should be trying to do. I've seen it happen to friends—from 2016 to 2024 so many men moved right because of the dumbass overcorrection from #MeToo to #AllMenAreTrash. Zero nuance. A justifiable call for accountability became hyperpoliticized into hate and alienation. Now Dems are paying for it.





To restate my previous concluding statement, fuck it all.

158ksne,1690227807,7/24/2023 19:43,TrueOffMyChest,I want to remove my best friend from my life but I'm scared,"Before I begin, I apologize if my words are not understood. English is not my first language

Hello, good afternoon. Before I begin to tell you my story, I must give you 3 important explanations about my life so that you understand what has brought me to this situation.

Explanation 1: I am [REDACTED_NAME] antisocial person since I was a child. I have never been bullied but in a way I bullied myself for as long as I can remember. I was nervous when people talked to me, I didn't know how to relate, I have always been disgusted by the way I look. I was always afraid of what others would think of me etc. I never knew if it was because of some nl diagnosed disorder but the point is that it made me anxious and depressed which necessitated prescription meds. But everything exploded when the pandemic started when I was 15 years old. I thought that thanks to virtuality I could overcome everything. Take advantage of this time to improve myself. But no, as I was going through this age, what happened to every kid happened. Acne came, but my case was an abnormal one. The hormonal imbalance of age, plus the genetic inheritance of two parents with sensitive and susceptible skins, plus a constant stress that agorated me mentally made my acne so abnormal that specialists had to see it. My face was full, unrecognizable. And my self-esteem was at rock bottom. I wouldn't leave my room, I wouldn't turn on the cameras for virtual classes. I was in a constant hole and it was getting worse. I weighed 100 kilos when I was 15 years old and I was 5'10"". This is just a context, you don't have to worry. At almost 18 years old I have lost almost 30 kilos and I am [REDACTED_NAME] little by little. I relate better, sometimes it is hard for me but I no longer think so much about what people think.

Explanation 2: During that time when I was in a deep depression hole, I started to frequent the Internet more. You know, forums, discord servers, apps to meet people. And it was on one of those servers that this all started.

Explanation 3: two months after joining a discord server and meeting new people I fell in love with a girl from another country who I called girl 1. I tried not to get my hopes up too high because she was from another country and was still young. We both knew we liked each other and were considering starting something. But, a week after we confessed she became a girlfriend of a guy in our group of friends. I knew I shouldn't get my hopes up but I think I fell into depression because of the shock that my first love would replace me like that. Anyway, five months later I met girl 2.  She was nice and I ended up falling in love with her. Her too, the problem? It seems she had a crush on me and a friend and didn't know what to do. Although in the end she chose me, eventually the thought that I might not be chosen began to haunt me. We ended things as friends and got along well even though we don't talk anymore. Anyway, 6 months later I fell in love. This time not spontaneously but with a girl (girl 3) who I had been friends with for 1 year. She felt different, we had the same tastes, same mood, same hobbies. We seemed perfect together. We both liked each other but didn't want to formalize. Me because I still had self-esteem issues and she because her mother was very strict and conservative. But I really liked her so I decided that as a first step in my personal improvement, I would go to her country to meet her and her mother. Talk to them and formalize with him permission from the mother. The old fashioned way I guess. Girl 3 was very happy. My dad supported me because he already knew her and had spoken to her before, we were making plans to go in two months. This happened around June 2022. By this point I had decided to leave the Internet in general but I kept talking to her through WhatsApp. Everything was fine until suddenly for a week she stopped talking to me. Without warning, I thought something happened with her mother but thanks to my best friend I found out she became a girlfriend of a guy. I was devastated, I relapsed into self-harm. I had a severe anxiety attack that I hadn't had in 1 years. It was so bad that I had to call my dad to calm me down. It was horrible to go through that. Things got better, we talked months later, she accepted her mistake and I accepted that I got my hopes up too high. We ended well and we talk from time to time. Why I tell you all this. Because as you will see from past experiences I have developed a fear or trauma of being replaced. 

Now I do. The story of the title that brought you here. If you made it this far thank you. You are an empathetic person.

Two years ago at my lowest point, on one of these servers I met my best friend who we'll just call (BF) to differentiate from the other girls. We were both mods on a server and we became friends. I liked her but at this time I didn't develop love for her I was in transition from what happened with girl 1. But we became pretty close when I helped her deal with a problem with her lunatic ex. About this guy I'll just say that idiot was a manipulative creep.

 Anyway, within 2 months of this she became friends with a guy from her town that I met on discord as well. He was a nice guy and we became close friends. By this point I was already friends with girl 3 and was about to start something with girl 2. Little by little I made him closer to BF, she was nice to me and we trusted each other. We each had our problems and we would tell each other and help each other. I would tell her about my insecurities and she would tell me about her problems with her alcoholic father. 

Just as we both talked about our partners asking for advice. By this point we became best friends. We would tell each other everything, so it went on until we reached June 2022. I had decided to leave the internet to concentrate on my development and school altogether. But I had not stopped talking to her as we had our numbers. By this point we had had some problems as in the year of friendship it had become recurrent that I would give her advice and she would ignore me and it would backfire precisely because she ignored me.



 This did not matter to me. After all I wasn't her boss or anything. So every time it happened we would laugh at the irony. Anyway, a month goes by since I left and we find out that her boyfriend has been cheating on her for 2 months. Yes, it was ugly. We found the girls and they apologized because they didn't know. While he was upset because he felt that they were manipulating everything against him. Yes, as you can see this guy who we will call (Ex1) was a manipulator. I guess we should have seen him before but he seemed nice. He was my friend and I had his number, I didn't insult him. I just told him if he cared about her not to talk to her until she calmed down. I spent the next 3 months helping BF get over this, get her to open up and accept her problems as the issue with her father was getting worse. It was a difficult time but I made sure I was there for her just as she was there for me 3 months ago when girl 3 broke my heart. 

Now comes something that continues to make me feel guilty. In these 3 months, I don't know why. I fell in love with her, maybe it was the closeness that was generated based on her breakup that happened. The fact that we were constantly talking to help her or just because. All that added to the fact that she has always been nice nice plus she is pretty cute made me have romantic feelings towards them. I don't know what I said at the moment. I felt like I was taking advantage of her. That everything I did helping her was for this and I didn't like it. I felt like I took advantage of the trust and closeness she gave me. So I decided not to say anything. To wait for it to pass or to feel that I was no longer taking advantage of the situation. Well, things got better. November 2022 and she was mostly over it. She was doing better and that made me happy, so I felt it was time to tell her how I felt. Not looking to be reciprocated, but to let her know and relieve me of that burden. But, a week before the beginning of December and, she tells me that she has a new boyfriend who we will call EX2.

Because of our closeness I knew that she was not in a position to have a new relationship. Sure, she had improved but I could tell that what happened to her before was still bothering her and prevented her from being good with her new boyfriend.

Now, what I am [REDACTED_NAME] to say will sound like jealousy but I ask for a vote of confidence because later on my words will become true. I already knew about this guy. I didn't trust him, I knew him from discord and everything I knew about him made it clear to me that I didn't trust him. 

And I told my friend this when she gave me hints that they were getting along. I told her that someone like that would do her no good in her recovery process. But as you can see she didn't listen to me. This happened again as with EX1 two months before the infidelity was discovered they were having problems and I advised BF to end the relationship as she felt distrustful of him and he was starting to be distant. I told them that this was not healthy but they did not listen to me. 



Then the cheating happened. I used to laugh at this type of situation, but now it hurt me that he didn't even seem to take my advice into account. I didn't expect her to do everything I told her, just to take into account the opinion of the person she said was her best friend. Well the month of December 2022 became hard. She started talking to me less. 



I thought it was because of problems but it started to become clear to me that she just liked to spend time with her boyfriend. Which wasn't bad I mean, he was her boyfriend. But of the few times she talked to me it was her asking for advice or just telling me about her boyfriend.  This. I didn't like it, since I liked her I felt like I was in the anti imposed friendzone and again I felt replaced. But it wasn't her fault in a way. She didn't owe me love, I did everything because I loved her and wanted to help her. So before I developed hatred for her I decided to put a stop to it. A few days before Christmas I told her that I liked her. And I told her that it would be good to take some time out of our friendship to improve both of us. Because she was leaving me aside. And it was wrong for me to feel uncomfortable in the face of her happiness because even though she started talking to me more again I still felt uncomfortable and that wasn't fair to her. So I told her that when she thinks we can get better she should talk to me again. And so it happened, two months passed, I turned 17, moved out and entered this phase where I no longer have the same fears as before. 



We got to February 2023. As I said I was already better. And that's when BF came back, we talked. She said she missed me and that she felt things could get better. That she would try to be a better friend but I made it clear to her that that was not the point but to communicate better because she was a great friend and emotional support for me. I thought that after two months my feelings of love were over but they were not. After a few weeks of talking I understood that they were still there. But I made up my mind, I wasn't going to let this ruin our friendship again so I decided to kill them little by little. It didn't work for the most part but I made sure this wasn't a drag between us. It worked and we went back to being great friends.



We went back to the way things used to be, we would tell each other everything, help each other and talk about her life. My family was aware of her and sometimes she would greet them when we video called. Because she still had family problems only her mother was aware of me and seemed to have a good impression. 

Well, as time went on I realized that she was having distrust issues again with her boyfriend EX2. Just like she had with EX1, I told her it was normal because of what happened to her before. I stopped thinking of EX2 as a bad person and focused more on helping her and gave her advice. But she wouldn't listen to me and had problems because of that. Sometimes she would stop talking to me because she would get discouraged and come back like new. Back to this again. It wasn't wrong for her to ask me for advice but I felt like that friend who is always there for you to ask for things. And that added to the fact that most of the time she would ask me for advice and then seem to disregard it. I know that this issue of the advice I give her doesn't sound so important and big but believe me, it became a strong issue between us because she told me that she was aware but sometimes she felt that I had her in a bubble always taking care of her. This bothered me because I always helped her when she asked me to. So that she didn't feel that I was overwhelming her. 



She just didn't want to do what I told her to do, which wouldn't be bad but when it became constant and always with serious issues it started to affect me. Now comes a plot twist that I think was already coming because of the name I gave it.



That's right. She and EX2 broke up. Not because he was unfaithful but because well, he was a psycho. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] kidding. We found out that he kept threatening any guy she knew and felt was a threat. How? The fucker was in the military and had access to that kind of thing to track people. So we also found out that he was older than he said he was. Plus he revealed that when BF and EX1 broke up. EX2 was already after my friend, asking people what she liked and approaching her with bad intentions. Yeah. That was all pretty fucked up. I had to counsel her and mediate between them to get things over with. 



Here comes something that fucked me up. This guy, EX2 despite being a diagnosed psychopath,(we found out later) despite being a freeloader and all. He took my advice more than she did. BF would ask me my opinion on the subject and when I would tell her how it would be good to end things she would ignore me and do as she saw fit. In the end things ended, I didn't even find out from her that they had ended. I found out from a mutual friend. 



I decided not to bother or express my annoyance that she never seemed to take my opinion into account. After all I had just gone through a relationship full of problems and lies so I thought it was understandable.



Now in the present. July 2023, 4 months since she and EX2 broke up and things are worse. It should be noted that in the middle of these months I told her that I have liked her for a while now because we were better off. I made it clear to her that I didn't want a relationship and I knew she wasn't ready either. She understood and actually told me that before she became EX1's partner she liked me. I won't lie, this made me happy for a few seconds but then I thought. ""That means she chose someone else instead of me"" I tried not to think about that since after all it's only because of my trauma of being replaced. Now, she meets yet another guy from her town who is quite nice. Esteluevo tells her that he is in love with her. BFF seriously thinks about it. I tell her it's not a good idea. That she's still upset about what happened and it would only hurt the guy. She didn't listen to me but at the same time she did. In a way they actually cut friendship because he became something weird and insistent. Which I warned myself about. 



And well. You may wonder what is the current situation that has led me to this. I will tell you dear reader. Actually in the last two months he has only called me twice. And both were to ask me for advice and then not to call me back. Despite the fact that I have been asking him for a while now if he has time to watch movies together or things about things in general. 



Our chats turned into Deserts. He talks to me often every other day where it's just me wishing him a good day. And when those two days pass he replies me with an ""xd"" to some nice message I leave him. And he talks to me like it's nothing for a few hours and then back to the same thing. There are times when we chat for two days but it's because he has problems and asks me for advice. And then he leaves. 



This is what led me to post this. I feel like she takes it for granted that I will always be here for her to give her advice. Even though she usually doesn't listen to me. So I feel there is less value in her asking me for advice. She only calls me when there are problems. When I tell her I feel bad she just says ""I hope it passes"" and when she tells me I make sure she knows I am [REDACTED_NAME] to help her etc. Don't get me wrong. I don't want and never wanted anything in return for helping her. She just doesn't feel resipocro.and here comes what hurt me the most. 



BF and EX1 are back to being friends. I told her it was a bad idea as it gives me hints that it is with ulterior motives but hey. It is his decision and I respect it. What hurts me the most is that on those days when she doesn't talk to me I see her online and uploading to her WhatsApp and instagram statuses as she talks and has a good time with him. How they both make it clear they are great friends. I felt replaced again. But ne I told myself that she has never owed me anything, that she is in her right to have friends and if she wants someone more than me no problem. But two days ago everything got worse because of one stupid thing. Alfin talked to me after two days and we talked well, I noticed she had a match icon on WhatsApp and I asked her with whom. He told me with EX1. I don't know what happened at that moment that I couldn't hold back the tears and he started crying sitting on my chair. I didn't understand why. These match icons were things I had never cared too much about. I only did it once in a while for memes. So, why am I crying? Because I can't hold back the tears when I see his profile picture. Because I care so much about something so stupidThat's when I remembered, I asked for a funny one a month ago. It wasn't something as basic as photo sharing. It meant she didn't think as much of me as she did of him. 



If I was her normal friend this would pass as nothing or I would laugh but for months she has assured me that I am [REDACTED_NAME] best friend. That she appreciates me etc. But nowadays he doesn't talk to me and EX1 is a problem. It has already happened more than once that he tells me something taking for h3cho that it is something he has already told me but it turns out that I am [REDACTED_NAME] aware of it and it is the first time he tells me. We pretend it's just me being forgetful but I know for a fact that he hasn't told me those things. He doesn't take me into account. Which hurts me.



Now comes something that is not his fault as it is because of my issues, since I left the internet and moved I only talk to 3 people. BFF and my best friends from my previous city who I see every weekend. But they and I don't like to chat, we like to let it all out in person. So by chat I only talk to her . So with how little she talks to me I practically don't talk to anyone. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] getting better at socializing but I feel alone. I feel abandoned. 



All this with all the times I've been replaced are tearing me apart. All the time I think maybe it's just me being paranoid. Or maybe all the times it was because there is a constant in my acting that I still don't notice that makes them walk away from me for someone else. 



That's why I did this, I need help and I don't know who to ask for it. I don't want to tell my parents yet for fear. And I don't know if maybe I am [REDACTED_NAME] one who is behaving badly in all this. After all she had already told me that she has an avoidant disorder. When we come from talking to each other a lot it's hard to believe. I want to cut our friendship at once because more and more I start to generate bad ideas about her, I think that maybe she is aware of the harm she is doing to me and it amuses her. Even if this were true I would rather leave with the idea of the great friendship we had. But, leaving would mean being alone for a while again and losing a friendship of 2 years that has helped me improve. I owe much of my personal development to her and I don't know if maybe I should fight for this friendship. But it seems like she doesn't even try to have a friendship at this point.



This post is me asking. I am [REDACTED_NAME], afraid of being wrong. Afraid of being manipulated. Afraid of being paranoid. Afraid of being alone again. Afraid of being replaced for the fourth time. If you are reading this. If you have the slightest bit of advice or words of encouragement please leave them. I don't know what to do at this point and I feel nervous.

1jfmty9,1742470606,3/20/2025 11:36,stories,My fiancé told me she was going on a girls' trip—so I had her plane ticket redirected.,"
If you only read the title, I might sound like a controlling jerk. But I promise you, I’m not.

I’ve been with my fiancée, Rachel, for three years. We got engaged six months ago, and everything seemed perfect—until I started noticing little things. Sudden late-night meetings, a new password on her phone, and the biggest red flag: a “girls’ trip” she was oddly secretive about.

I wasn’t the jealous type, but something didn’t sit right. So, I did something I never thought I’d do—I checked our shared airline account. Turns out, her “girls' trip” was actually a solo ticket to a tropical resort… booked under her name and another man’s. I recognized his name. A “friend” from work.

I didn’t confront her right away. Instead, I got to planning. I quietly canceled her ticket and rebooked it… to her parents' house. Same departure time, just a very different destination. I also compiled all the evidence—screenshots, texts I found on her old tablet, and even a few Venmo transactions that made things obvious.

The day of the trip arrived. I drove her to the airport, kissed her goodbye, and watched as she confidently walked inside. I had one of my friends tail her to see the moment she realized she wasn’t heading to paradise with her affair partner.

Her first call came 20 minutes later. I ignored it. The frantic texts followed:

Rachel: “Why is my ticket wrong??”
Rachel: “Where are my bags??”
Rachel: “DID YOU DO THIS???”

I didn’t reply. Instead, I group-texted her, her parents, and her older brother with a simple message:

“Hey, Rachel’s on her way to see you. She has something important to explain. Check your emails for the full story. Hope she has a great stay.”

Then, I blocked her number.

I don’t know how things went when she landed, but judging by the hundred missed calls from her and a few from her mom… I’d say it wasn’t pretty. Meanwhile, I changed the locks, packed up her things, and had them delivered to her parents' place.

I spent that weekend with my best friends, having the celebratory drinks I didn’t know I needed.

So yeah, Rachel did go on a trip—just not the one she planned.

1gz7val,1732499910,11/25/2024 1:58,self,I realized today that my relationship with my ex husband is probably the healthiest relationship in my life right now. ,"We were married for 15 years, divorced for ten. We always prioritized getting along and coparenting peacefully over everything else. And I have to say, we did a damn good job. Our daughter is very successful in her field,  and our son just graduated from Navy boot camp. 

Because of the graduation, ex and I travelled together several states away and stayed in adjoining rooms for 5 days while we attended graduation and spent time with our son. It was nice to spend that time with someone who intuitively knows my quirks, and vise versa. It was fun to be able to joke about things that used to be common topics of arguments. And it meant we could maximize the little time we had with out kid before he flew to A school. 

I’m proud of younger us for maintaining the friendship even when we couldn’t maintain the marriage. And I’m happy for us as we get older that we both have a good friend. ",8462,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15hunlt,1691139358,8/4/2023 8:55,offmychest,My bestfriend died two months ago.,"My bestfriend died two months ago

As the title says my best friend died two months ago. I (23M) lost my best friend ""Adam"" (24M). You know there was a time in my life where I thought I had been mentally hardened and prepared for anything that life would throw my way. But I've been having a hard time as of late feeling accepted or welcome. To preface I was homeless for about 4 years as a child 6-10 so I never got the ability to develop social skills as a child. I had met my best friend at the age of 10 when I had moved back to my home state with my mother after she worked tirelessly to save enough to move and be around family. At this point I was shy and introverted, when I had met him it was only for a brief period of time where we saw each other at an elementary school before we moved to another part of town where I had transferred schools. It wasn't until middle school that I had remet my then acquaintance.  We had moved into my mother's then boyfriends house across the street. I had seen my friend across the street with all his friends over and had brought up the possibility of me coming over to him the next day. He gave me the goofiest smile ever and put his hand on my shoulder and said next time don't ask just come over. That day I got off the bus and went to his house with him and had a blast. From that day on we would spend the majority of our time together. However at this point despite us being really close and spending lots of time together I always felt like the odd man out in the friend group and generally saw that I was excluded from most events our mutual friends would have or do. There were days i would find out from a mutual friend that he was at another friend's house and I would go over and try to hang out too only to be met with ""go home fatso"" or ""we didn't invite you go home"" which as a child broke me. I found excuses and reasons to exclude myself as I felt at that time I was the spare friend to have for everyone. I know now that the feelings I felt then are because of my MDD. Feelings of worthlessness, being not good enough, etc. So when I was 13 I had prepared a make shift noose and tried to hang myself, I had lost consciousness during this time but I remember waking up to my best friend frantically slapping me awake and doing what he believed to be good chest compressions. After I awoke I had about ten seconds of disbelief before sound had come back to me fully, shock or something of the sort made me deaf for a short period. When it finally came back all I heard was his voice yelling at me for doing something so stupid with tears in his eyes. It took me a second but upon hearing that and realizing I was alive I leaped at him and hugged him the hardest I've ever hugged someone before, and cried into his chest how sorry I was. We sat and talked for a few hours after this about our mutual doubts worries and fears before he decided he needed to get me home, the last thing he did before he left was made me laugh hysterically. My mother was too busy with other things in her life to notice the very obvious bruising around my neck, so I felt as if nobody truly noticed how I could be gone today it felt awful. Despite all that happening life went on. I would sleepover his house frequently as he would mine. We would play all kinds of xbox360 coop games together notably gears of war and borderlands both of which were his favorite series. It wasn't until 15 where me and him were the only friends of our 15 kids friend group stayed in contact or actively talked to each other. So we stayed that way for a long time being each others friend. When we were 16 and 17 we had both became friends with another kid we had met for this sake his name was Zach. My friend Adam already hung out with him a bunch of times and I only met him because I transferred to their classes. Zach and I became friends after I commented how he looked like Bryan Silva, he would at the end of the day ask if id want to come over to his house with him and Adam to smoke some weed to which I agreed cause I was already a pothead at this point. So it was the three amigos until we were 18 where I had transferred out of my school for a trade school. I had stayed in contact with Adam and Zach while at the trade school however because of my MDD and the negative thoughts that it produces I distanced myself from them. After distancing myself I had moved to Florida with my mother after she won a settlement to which this was one of my worst mistakes of my life. I trapped myself in my room in Florida and went into a spiral. Daily suicidal ideations and gluttonously eating my feelings away. While in Florida my mother met her now husband and were married after only 3 months of knowing each other. A racist jobless dead beat father who broke his own wrist after riding a motorcycle he knew the calipers were bad on. 9 months had passed since that accident and the blood boiled between the two constantly where my mother would destroy a TV and replace it or he would get high as a kite on oxy I assume and break shit in the house. For example he broke mine and my brothers bathroom counter, the light fixture to their bathroom etc list goes on. This was during the pandemic so due to me being the most recent hire at a machine shop I was let go and that further spiralled my depression. Until we were evicted, we moved from house to apartment to RV lots. I was working at Texas Roadhouse at the time when I had formally written my suicide letter. I thanked my mom for her tireless dedication to improving our lives however since she had met her husband she has thrown away her career, and ambitions for her life. Cursing the racist deadbeat with vitriol as he had called my best friend the n word on numerous occasions. I had planned to take a knife three towels and a jug of water onto a highway near the RV lots. Where I had planned to lay the towels down as forethought to not scar or to make first responders jobs easier to deal with, the jug to drink from while resting on my knees before ultimately gouging my neck open. However this never passed as I had COVID like symptoms and was subsequently taken to the hospital where I had disclosed to the nurse that I had suicidal ideations. He spoke to me briefly before leaving the room before returning with an administrator who had informed me that they were officially baker acting me. It was 2 am at this point and my mother was distraught waiting to hear about me before they brought her in and explained the situation. It wasn't until 3am that the ambulance that would come and take me to a psych ward. In that ride the emt that spoke to me was a retired army ranger. He listened to my story and my thought process to how I felt. And he held my hand and told me that despite his own troubles he saw himself in me, the doubts, the mental fog, the inexplicable hatred towards oneself. I don't believe in God but this man would have been an angel or saint. He eased my troubled mind. I was in there for five days despite a 3 day hold maximum. The first thing I did when I got out was call my best friend Adam and told him of everything that was going on and while he was at work he stopped everything he was doing to hear me out. He offered me a place to stay and despite my worries he insisted. With 180 dollars to my name a suitcase and a carry on bag I booked my flight back home. There he had cleared a room out for me and told me to stay for as long as I needed and told me to worry about paying him when I was stable. He was my savior for a second time in my life. It's been 3 years since I moved in with him and his parents in a split single home we paid rent on the 2nd floor of. They had their floor and we had ours. We still were big time coop partners being as everyone else stopped talking to us. This past may the unthinkable happened, I was up at 10 playing games when his mom knocked on my rooms door which she never did. When I opened the door she told me my best friend was dead. She had explained to me that the police came and knocked on the door a half an hour ago to inform the next of kin and that he had been hit by a train. I stood in utter shock, disbelief and asked if she was joking. She replied still in shock that yes he was dead. I then called all our old friends in a state of shock to let them know before they saw it on the news. I felt guilty I was envious of them, that they were able to release the pain and sadness they had felt instantly. It took me a week to fully process and be able to finally break down and cry. I have since reconnected with a few friends. Some of which expressed their condolences to me as if they weren't friends with him too. Most came to the celebration of life gathering I held but there were a few who spoke to me and acted as if they didn't know me despite us sharing nearly 6 years as friends. However despite me reconnecting with all these friends I can't help but to feel unwanted or unwelcome despite how some of them have said I've changed for the better from when I was a fat shy annoying kid I was. I ask these friends every other week or if they'd like to hang out some will leave me on read for a few hours before finally replying with "" oh I'm [REDACTED_NAME]"" or the friends who I feel see my messages and ignore them. Though there has been one good friend I've reconnected to Elly she and I were close when we were younger so we've decided that since we both lost our best friend we'd be best friends together. She's great but I don't want to feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] her or clingy so I try to make plans with others before seeing if she'd like to hang out. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] lost really. As if I don't know what to do without my best friend Adam being back home. And some of you will probably ask why so attached. Well basically me and him spent every waking moment together since I moved back since we were both single at the time atleast. It's was a bromance, we both told eachother we were brothers despite him being black and me being white, non blood brothers. I feel adrift and alone knowing he's gone. He was my onw true friend. And despite me and Elly reconnecting and becoming best friends I can't ever replace the bond I had with him. She's my best friend of course but im still relegated to having a single friend and I don't want to be so introverted anymore despite my shyness. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] now but ever word I wrote is true and I feel so horrible still despite the time that's passed.",2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1i4atn5,1737216684,1/18/2025 16:11,self,I didn't realize mothers cleaning up after you was something they actually did.,"I lived with my mother until I was 13, I was 14 when she passed. She loved me to bits but was an addict. She wasn't abusive outright; she showered us with love when she was awake, did what she could to make our holidays special, etc. But she was neglectful. Our home was often hoarder levels bad and she slept constantly. I used to spend nights awake making sure any cigarette she fell asleep holding was put out, as she had a tendency to fall asleep and drop them and burn holes in blankets (and myself, once). I spent my childhood taking care of my younger sibling.

After that I lived with my grandmother and her partner. I loved my grandmother, but I would be lying if I said she didn't have her faults. I don't remember much, but my childhood friend has remarked that both of them were toxic. She was bedbound, but also loved us to death and did her best to make sure me and my sibling were taken care of. She died of a stroke when I was 16. Me and my sibling found her half-alive.

Her partner was the embodiment of emotional terrorism. Everything I did was criticized, while my sibling could do no wrong. I took after my mother in terms of cleaning, with no one to teach me otherwise. If I cleaned it wasn't enough, and if I didn't it wasn't enough at that point, so it didn't make a difference to me. We don't speak now. She's alive, barely from my understanding. 

My fiancee and I had to escape a bad living situation and were staying with his mom for about a week. His mom came through the room we were using to use the master bathroom, and was picking things up to toss. It wasn't a lot; mostly a can here or there, an empty roll of toilet paper. Instinctively, I almost started apologizing for the mess before I realized; there wasn't one. She was just...doing what moms do.

Don't get me wrong, I've heard moms do that. Cook for their kids, pick up after them, even as adults. But it never fully solidified as a real thing in my head. Sort of a fucked up personal fable I guess. Always someone else, never me.

And then I cried that night while my fiancee held me.


Appreciate your mom's for me if y'all are on good terms with them and they're living. It's the little things. One day you'll forget first their voice, then their face, then their mannerisms. Remember the way they walk, the way they laugh, the way they talk. Record moments you love. You'll need them one day.",2360,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","This is probably one of the hardest things I've ever done.  I don't normally talk to anyone about what is going on in my head and especially not what happened in my past but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the two have come full circle and I just need someone to listen, even if it is strangers on the internet, and I thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.  *Also should clarify [F] here*

The earliest memories I have are of living with my mom and my grandparents, around the age of 4, my parents split when I was less than a year old.  They never got into many of the details as to why the split happened but I think I have it figured out now.  But I digress, anyways, those were the last truly happy memories of my life.

The worst/cause of it started when I was 4, my mom met and married a new guy and we moved almost an hour away from my grandparents to go live with him.  I had met him and I believe we lived with him for a little while before the wedding (fuzzy on some details) but it all changed after the wedding.  My mom was working to support all three of us because her new husband was too lazy to find a job.  

About the time things seemed to fall into a routine, my (now ex) step-dad came into my room one morning after my mom left for work.  He was completely naked and woke me up and crawled into bed with me.  He touched me and made me touch him.  After it was all over, he grabbed me by my hair and drug me to a closet in the hallway, he got a box and made me stand on it so my head was a few inches below the bar used to hang things off of and he took a metal coat hanger and twisted it into a noose of sorts, and put it over my head while he wrapped the other end around the bar.  He made me stand there for what seemed like hours, naked and scared while he yelled at me about how he would kill me and my mom if I ever told anyone what he did/what he was going to do to me.  He had me completely terrified, then for both my mom and I.

After that, it started happening every day after my mom left for work, I started feeling sick to my stomach and every morning I would throw up in this trashcan I kept by my bed when I heard the door shut when my mom left, I remember it was always pinkish/red and tasted like what I now know as heartburn, if that makes sense.  

I think he really broke me the summer before I started kindergarten.  Looking back now, I realize it was because he was scared I would tell someone once I got to school.  He started making me 'touch' him more and he got more violent every time after it was over.  We have this wooden knife block that my mom still keep on her counter (she doesn't know any of this) and he would grab the biggest knife and hold it to my throat and used the tip to trace over my naked body while he described in detail the way he would torture and kill me and my mom and slice us to pieces if I ever told anyone. Something similar happened almost every day (save for Sundays when my mom was off).

This was about the time I noticed that he was abusive towards my mom as well, I never saw him hit her, but looking back now, that was probably going on by this time.  He was mainly just controlling and verbally abusive as fuck in front of me towards her, but he never hit her in front of me at this point.

After I started school, he would make me do things to him or do things to me every morning or else he wouldn't take me to school.  School became my escape from the living hell that was my home.  I never really had a lot of friends, I think the other kids could sense I was different from them and I spent a lot of time just reading or eventually in the gifted class.

Fast forward to March of my kindergarten year.  Things really haven't changed at all at home, if anything they have gotten worse.  But I started throwing up in school, like a few times a day, and my stomach hurt really badly all the time, but I thought it was from the abuse so I didn't say anything.  The nurse sent me home, after I begged her not to, for a week straight.  My step-dad had my mom convinced that I was just faking it to stay home but he stopped being as violent.  After another few days of me not eating/getting better, my mom made the executive decision to take me to the doctor.  The nurses/doctor looked me over and made me pee in a cup.  Turns out I had appendicitis, and it was apparently pretty bad.  My doctor told my mom to take me to the hospital NOW.  I remember passing out on the ride there and the next thing I remember is waking up in recovery and crying my eyes out because I was still alive and I knew things would eventually go back to the way they were.  Also turns out my appendix had ruptured, drs gave me a few days if I hadn't come in when I did.

I'll make the rest a bit more abridged for the reader's sake.  Basically the abuse continued even when his sons from another marriage moved in with us (Until then it had been just my mom, step-dad and me).  this is one part of the story no one knows. One night his oldest son came into my room while I was putting together a puzzle, he said I shouldn't be up so late on my own (it was like 1am and my mom and step-dad were asleep).  He told me to come into his room and he made me crawl under the covers with him and touch him.  I remember after it was over he told me that his dad said not to tell anyone 'or else' and I went back to my room and cried.  He never seemed the same after that and he never did it again.  I felt so betrayed that he knew what was going on and instead of stopping it, made it worse.  He moved back with his mom a few months after that and so did his younger brother (who by my standards was a saint, a man who didn't abuse me, not once, not ever).

My mom ended up getting pregnant around the time his kids left with my little brother.  I remember he seemed really happy about the pregnancy, especially when they found out it was a boy.  I remember one day before school asking him if he was going to do the same thing to my brother he was doing to me and begging him not to, to just do it to me and leave him alone.  He responded with something like 'Don't worry no son of mine is going to turn out to be a faggot'.  I think that is when I realized that none of this would be happening if I were a boy.

Things continued as normal, as sickening of a routine as it is, until one night my mom and him got into a really bad fight over something, I can't even remember if I ever knew what.  I was laying in my bad and I could hear them in the other room, yelling and screaming, way worse than normal.  I snuck out of my room and crept down the hallway, I crawled on all fours to the living room and watched as he threw my mom, 8 or 9 mos pregnant onto the couch and threw a laundry basket at her, she struggled and eventually got up and tried to make her way into the kitchen to call the cops, he ripped the phone out of the wall and grabbed her by her hair and yelled at her.  I went back into my room and cried myself to sleep scared to death I was going to lose my brother before he was born.

Fast forward a month or so, my mom had my brother, everything was normal and they were both sent home on time.  The happiest time of my life, while they were married, was while my mom was on maternity leave, I got to hang out with my mom and little brother and I didn't have to touch my step-dad nearly as much.  He still came into my room at night after my mom went to sleep sometimes.

After my mom went back to work, things went back to the way they used to be although not for long.  A month or so after she went back to work, she picked me up from school and said we were moving in with one of her friends from work and that we were never going back to the house we used to live in ever again.  I have never been so happy as in that moment and I will forever love and respect my mother for having the courage to leave an abusive situation, even if she didn't know the half of it, which I am [REDACTED_NAME] she knew nothing about the abuse, I have one hell of a pokerface when I feel the life of a loved one depends on it, especially my mom.

There is the first part of my life story, I will post more later.  Even if no one reads this, it feels amazing just to type it out.

Also, if you have read this massive wall o' text, I thank you kindly, it really does mean a lot to me.  ",46,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1khzfqj,1746733870,5/8/2025 19:51,stories,"I'm a long-haul trucker. I stopped for a 'lost kid' on a deserted highway in the dead of night. What I saw attached to him, and the question he asked, is why I don't drive anymore.","
This happened a few years back. I was doing long-haul, mostly cross-country routes, the kind that take you through vast stretches of nothing. You know the ones – where the radio turns to static for hours, and the only sign of life is the occasional pair of headlights going the other way, miles apart. I was young, eager for the miles, the money. Didn’t mind the solitude. Or so I thought.

The route I was on took me across a long, desolate stretch of highway that ran between the borders of two large governmental territories. I don’t want to say exactly where, but think big, empty spaces, lots of trees, not much else. It was notorious among drivers for being a dead zone – no signal, no towns for a hundred miles either side, and prone to weird weather. Most guys tried to hit it during daylight, but schedules are schedules. Mine had me crossing it deep in the night.

I remember the feeling. Utter blackness outside the sweep of my headlights. The kind of dark that feels like it’s pressing in on the cab. The only sounds were the drone of the diesel engine, the hiss of the air brakes now and then, and the rhythmic thrum of the tires on asphalt. Hypnotic. Too hypnotic.

I’d been driving for about ten hours, with a short break a few states back. Coffee was wearing off. The dashboard lights were a dull green glow, comforting in a way, but also making the darkness outside seem even more absolute. My eyelids felt like they had lead weights attached. You fight it, you know? Slap your face, roll down the window for a blast of cold air, crank up whatever music you can find that hasn’t dissolved into static. I was doing all of that.

It must have been around 2 or 3 AM. I was in that weird state where you’re not quite asleep, but not fully awake either. Like your brain is running on low power mode. The white lines on the road were starting to blur together, stretching and warping. Standard fatigue stuff. I remember blinking hard, trying to refocus.

That’s when I saw it. Or thought I saw it.

Just a flicker at the edge of my headlights, on the right shoulder of the road. Small. Low to the ground. For a split second, I registered a shape, vaguely human-like, and then it was gone, swallowed by the darkness as I passed.

My first thought? Deer. Or a coyote. Common enough. But it hadn't moved like an animal. It had been upright. My brain, sluggish as it was, tried to process it. Too small for an adult. Too still for an animal startled by a rig.

Then the logical part, the part that was still trying to keep me safe on the road, chimed in: You’re tired. Seeing things. Happens.

And I almost accepted that. I really did. Shook my head, took a swig of lukewarm water from the bottle beside me. Kept my eyes glued to the road ahead. The image, though, it kind of stuck. A small, upright shape. Like a child.

No way, I told myself. Out here? Middle of nowhere? Middle of the night? Impossible. Kids don’t just wander around on inter-territorial highways at 3 AM. It had to be a trick of the light, a bush, my eyes playing games. I’ve seen weirder things born of exhaustion. Shadows that dance, trees that look like figures. It’s part of the job when you’re pushing limits.

I drove on for maybe another thirty seconds, the image fading, my rational mind starting to win. Just a figment.
Then, I glanced at my passenger-side mirror. Habit. Always checking.

And my blood went cold. Not just cold, it felt like it turned to slush.

There, illuminated faintly by the red glow of my trailer lights receding into the distance, was the reflection of a small figure. Standing. On the shoulder of the road. Exactly where I’d thought I’d seen something.

It wasn’t a bush. It wasn’t a shadow. It was small, and it was definitely standing there, unmoving, as my truck pulled further and further away.

My heart started hammering against my ribs. This wasn’t fatigue. This was real. There was someone, something, back there. And it looked tiny.

Every instinct screamed at me. Danger. Wrong. Keep going. But another voice, the one that makes us human, I suppose, whispered something else. A kid? Alone out here? What if they’re hurt? Lost?

I fought with myself for a few seconds that stretched into an eternity. The image in the mirror was getting smaller, fainter. If I didn’t act now, they’d be lost to the darkness again. God, the thought of leaving a child out there, if that’s what it was…

Against my better judgment, against that primal urge to just floor it, I made a decision. I slowed the rig, the air brakes hissing like angry snakes. Pulled over to the shoulder, the truck groaning in protest. Put on my hazards, their rhythmic flashing cutting into the oppressive blackness.

Then, I did what you’re never supposed to do with a full trailer on a narrow shoulder. I started to reverse. Slowly. Carefully. My eyes flicking between the mirrors, trying to keep the trailer straight, trying to relocate that tiny figure. The crunch of gravel under the tires sounded unnaturally loud.

It took a minute, maybe two, but it felt like an hour. The red glow of my tail lights eventually washed over the spot again. And there it was.

A kid.

I stopped the truck so my cab was roughly alongside them, maybe ten feet away. Switched on the high beams, hoping to get a better look, and also to make myself clearly visible as just a truck, not something else.

The kid was… small. Really small. I’d guess maybe six, seven years old? Hard to tell in the glare. They were just standing there, on the very edge of the gravel shoulder, right where the trees began. The woods pressed in close on this stretch of road, tall, dark pines and dense undergrowth that looked like a solid black wall just beyond the reach of my lights.

The kid wasn’t looking at me. They were facing sort of parallel to the road, just… walking. Slowly. Like they were on a stroll, completely oblivious to the massive eighteen-wheeler that had just pulled up beside them, engine rumbling, lights blazing. They were wearing what looked like pajamas. Thin, light-colored pajamas. In the chill of the night. No coat, no shoes that I could see.

My mind reeled. This was wrong. So many levels of wrong.

I killed the engine. The sudden silence was almost deafening, amplifying the crickets, the rustle of leaves in the woods from a breeze I couldn’t feel in the cab. My heart was still thumping, a weird mix of fear and adrenaline and a dawning sense of responsibility.

I rolled down the  window. The night air hit me, cold and damp, carrying the scent of pine and wet earth.

“Hey!” I called out. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud in the quiet. “Hey, kid!”

No response. They just kept walking, one small, bare foot in front of the other, at a pace that was taking them absolutely nowhere fast. Their head was down, slightly. I couldn’t see their face properly.

“Kid! Are you okay?” I tried again, louder this time.

Slowly, so slowly, the kid stopped. They didn’t turn their head fully, just sort of angled it a fraction, enough that I could see a pale sliver of cheek in the spill of my headlights. Still not looking at me. Still ignoring the multi-ton machine idling beside them.

A prickle of unease ran down my spine. Not the normal kind of unease. This was deeper, colder. Animals act weird sometimes, but kids? A lost kid should be scared, relieved, something. This one was… nothing.

“What are you doing out here all alone?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm, friendly. Like you’re supposed to with a scared kid. Even though this one didn’t seem scared at all. “It’s the middle of the night.”

Silence. Just the sound of their bare feet scuffing softly on the gravel as they took another step, then another. As if my presence was a minor inconvenience, a background noise they were choosing to ignore.

This wasn’t right. My internal alarm bells were clanging louder now. My hand hovered near the gearstick. Part of me wanted to slam it into drive and get the hell out of there. But the image of this tiny child, alone, possibly in shock… I couldn’t just leave. Could I?

“Where are your parents?” I pushed, my voice a bit sharper than I intended. “Are you lost?”

Finally, the kid stopped walking completely. They turned their head, just a little more. Still not looking directly at my cab, more towards the front of my truck, into the glare of the headlights. I could see their face a bit better now. Pale. Featureless in the harsh light, like a porcelain doll. Small, dark smudges that might have been eyes. No expression. None. Not fear, not sadness, not relief. Just… blank. An unreadable slate.

Then, a voice. Small. Thin. Like the rustle of dry leaves.
“Lost.”

Just that one word. It hung in the air between us.

Relief washed over me, quickly followed by a fresh wave of concern. Okay, lost. That’s something I can deal with. “Okay, kid. Lost is okay. We can fix lost. Where do you live? Where were you going?”

The kid finally, slowly, turned their head fully towards my cab. Towards me.
I still couldn’t make out much detail in their face. The angle, the light, something was obscuring it, keeping it in a sort of shadowy vagueness despite the headlights. But I could feel their gaze. It wasn't like a normal kid's look. There was a weight to it, an intensity that was deeply unsettling for such a small form.

“Home,” the kid said, that same thin, reedy voice. “Trying to get home.”

“Right, home. Where is home?” I asked, leaning forward a bit, trying to project reassurance. “Is it near here? Did you wander off from a campsite? A car?” There were no campsites for miles. No broken-down cars on the shoulder. I knew that.

The kid didn’t answer that question directly. Instead, they took a small step towards the truck. Then another. My hand tensed on the door handle, ready to open it, to offer… what? A ride? Shelter? I didn’t know.

“It’s cold out here,” I said, stating the obvious. “You should get in. We can get you warm, and I can call for help when we get to a spot with a signal.” My CB was useless, just static. My phone had shown ‘No Service’ for the last hour.

The kid stopped about five feet from my passenger door. Still in that pale, thin pajama-like outfit. Barefoot on the sharp gravel. They should be shivering, crying. They were doing neither.

“Can you help me?” the kid asked. The voice was still small, but there was a different inflection to it now. Less flat. A hint of… something else. Pleading, maybe?

“Yeah, of course, I can help you,” I said. “That’s why I stopped. Where are your parents? How did you get here?”

The kid tilted their head. A jerky, unnatural little movement. “They’re waiting. At home.”

“Okay… And where’s home? Which direction?” I gestured vaguely up and down the empty highway.

The kid didn’t point down the road. They made a small, subtle gesture with their head, a little nod, towards the trees. Towards the impenetrable darkness of the woods lining the highway.

“In there,” the kid said.

My stomach clenched. “In the woods? Your home is in the woods?”

“Lost,” the kid repeated, as if that explained everything. “Trying to find the path. It’s dark.”

“Yeah, it’s… it’s very dark,” I agreed, my eyes scanning the treeline. It looked like a solid wall of black. No sign of any path, any habitation. Just dense, old-growth forest. The kind of place you could get lost in for days, even in daylight.

“Can you… come out?” the kid asked. “Help me look? It’s not far. I just… I can’t see it from here.”

Every rational thought in my head screamed NO. Get out of the truck? In the middle of nowhere, in the pitch dark, with this… strange child, who wanted me to go into those woods? No. Absolutely not.

But the kid looked so small. So vulnerable. If there was even a tiny chance they were telling the truth, that their house was just a little way in, and they were genuinely lost…

“I… I don’t think that’s a good idea, buddy,” I said, trying to sound gentle. “It’s dangerous in there at night. For both of us. Best thing is for you to hop in here with me. We’ll drive until we get a signal, and then we’ll call the police, or the rangers. They can help find your home properly.”

The kid just stood there. That blank, unreadable face fixed on me.
“But it’s right there,” they insisted, their voice a little more insistent now. “Just a little way. I can almost see it. If you just… step out… the light from your door would help.”

My skin was crawling. There was something profoundly wrong with this scenario. The way they were trying to coax me out. The lack of normal emotional response. The pajamas. The bare feet. The woods.

I looked closer at the kid, trying to pierce that strange vagueness around their features. My headlights were bright, but it was like they absorbed the light rather than reflected it. Their eyes… I still couldn’t really see their eyes. Just dark hollows.

“I really think you should get in the truck,” I said, my voice firmer now. “It’s warmer in here. We can figure it out together.”

The kid took another step closer. They were almost at my running board now.
“Please?” they said. That reedy voice again. “My leg hurts. I can’t walk much further. If you could just… help me a little. Just to the path.”

My internal conflict was raging. My trucker instincts, honed by years of seeing weird stuff and hearing weirder stories at truck stops, were blaring warnings. But the human part, the part that saw a child in distress, was still there, still arguing.

I was tired. So damn tired. Maybe I wasn’t thinking straight. Maybe this was all some bizarre misunderstanding.

I squinted, trying to see past the kid, towards the treeline they’d indicated. Was there a faint trail I was missing? A flicker of light deep in the woods? No. Nothing. Just blackness. Solid, unyielding blackness.

And then I saw it.
It wasn’t something I saw clearly at first. It was more like… an anomaly. A disturbance in the darkness behind the kid.

The kid was standing with their back mostly to the woods, facing my truck. Behind them, the darkness of the forest was absolute. Or it should have been. But there was something… connected to them. Something that stretched from the small of their back, from under the thin pajama top, and disappeared into the deeper shadows of the trees.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, a weird shadow cast by my headlights hitting them at an odd angle. Maybe a rope they were dragging? A piece of clothing snagged on a branch?

I leaned forward, trying to get a clearer view. The kid was still talking, their voice a low, persistent murmur. “It’s not far… please… just help me… I’m so cold…”

But I wasn’t really listening to the words anymore. I was focused on that… that thing behind them.

It wasn’t a rope. It wasn’t a shadow.
It was… a tube. A long, dark, thick tube.
It seemed to emerge directly from the kid’s lower back, impossibly, seamlessly. It was dark matte, like a strip of the night itself given form, and it snaked away from the child, maybe ten, fifteen feet, before disappearing into the inky blackness between two thick pine trunks. It wasn’t rigid; it seemed to have a slight, almost imperceptible flexibility, like a massive, sluggish umbilical cord made of shadow. It didn’t reflect any light from my headlamps. It just… absorbed it.

My breath hitched in my throat. My blood, which had been cold before, now felt like it had frozen solid. This wasn’t just wrong. This was… impossible. Unnatural.

The kid was still trying to coax me. “Are you going to help me? It’s just there. You’re so close.”

My voice, when I finally found it, was barely a whisper. I couldn’t take my eyes off that… appendage.
“Kid… what… what is that? Behind you?”

The kid flinched. Not a big movement, just a tiny, almost imperceptible tightening of their small frame. Their head, which had been tilted pleadingly, straightened. The blankness on their face seemed to… solidify.

“What’s what?” they asked, their voice suddenly devoid of that pleading tone. It was flat again. Colder.

“That… that thing,” I stammered, pointing with a shaking finger. “Coming out of your back. Going into the woods. What is that?”

The kid didn’t turn to look. They didn’t need to. Their gaze, those dark, unseen eyes, bored into me.
“It’s nothing,” they said. The voice was still small, but it had a new edge to it. A hardness. “You’re seeing things. You’re tired.”

They were using my own earlier rationalization against me.

“No,” I said, my voice gaining a tremor of conviction born of sheer terror. “No, I’m not. I see it. It’s right there. It’s… it’s connected to you.”

The kid was silent for a long moment. The only sound was the thumping of my own heart, so loud I was sure they could hear it. The crickets had stopped. The wind seemed to die down. An unnatural stillness fell over the scene.

Then, the kid’s face began to change.
It wasn’t a dramatic, movie-monster transformation. It was far more subtle, and far more terrifying. The blankness didn’t leave, but it… sharpened. The pale skin seemed to tighten over the bones. The areas where the eyes were, those dark smudges, seemed to deepen, to become more shadowed, more intense. And a flicker of something ancient and utterly alien passed across their features. It wasn't human anger. It was something older, colder, and infinitely more patient, now strained to its limit.

The air in my cab suddenly felt thick, heavy, hard to breathe.

“Just come out of the truck,” the kid said, and the voice… oh god, the voice.
It wasn’t the small, reedy voice of a child anymore. It was deeper. Resonant. With a strange, grating undertone, like stones grinding together. It was coming from that small frame, but it was impossibly large, impossibly old. It vibrated in my chest.

“Come out. Now.” The command was absolute.

My hand, which had been hovering near the gearstick, now gripped it like a lifeline. My other hand fumbled for the ignition key, which I’d stupidly left in.

“What are you?” I choked out, staring at the monstrous thing playing dress-up in a child’s form, at the dark, pulsating tube that was its anchor to the shadows.

The kid’s head tilted again, that jerky, unnatural movement. The expression on its face – if you could call it that – was one of pure, unadulterated annoyance. Contempt. Like I was a particularly stupid insect it had failed to swat.

And then it spoke, in that same terrible, resonant, grinding voice. The words it said are burned into my memory, colder than any winter night.

“Why,” it rasped, the sound seeming to scrape the inside of my skull, “the FUCK are humans smarter now?”

That was it.
That one sentence. The sheer, cosmic frustration in it. The implication of past encounters, of easier prey. The utter alien nature of it.

I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I reacted.
Primal fear, the kind that bypasses all higher brain function, took over.
My hand twisted the key. The diesel engine roared back to life, a sudden, violent explosion of sound in the horrifying stillness.
The kid, the thing, actually recoiled. A small, jerky step back. The expression – that awful, tightened, ancient look – intensified.

I slammed the gearstick into drive. My foot stomped on the accelerator. The truck lurched forward, tires spinning on the gravel for a terrifying second before they bit into the asphalt.
I didn’t look at it. I couldn’t. I stared straight ahead, my knuckles white on the steering wheel, the whole cab vibrating around me.

The truck surged forward, gaining speed with agonizing slowness. For a horrible moment, I imagined that tube-thing whipping out, trying to snag the trailer, to pull me back, to drag me into those woods. I imagined that small figure, with its ancient, terrible voice, somehow keeping pace.

I risked a glance in my driver-side mirror.
It was standing there. On the shoulder. Unmoving.
The headlights of my departing truck cast its small silhouette into sharp relief. And behind it, the dark tube was still visible, a thick, obscene cord snaking back into the endless night of the forest. It didn't seem to be retracting or moving. It just was.

The thing didn’t pursue. It just stood and watched me go.
And that, somehow, was almost worse. The sheer confidence. The patience. Like it knew there would be others. Or maybe it was just annoyed that this particular attempt had failed.

I drove.
I don’t know for how long. I just drove. My foot was welded to the floor. The engine screamed. I watched the speedometer needle climb, far past any legal or safe limit for a rig that size, on a road that dark. I didn’t care.
The image of that thing, that child-shape with its dark umbilical to the woods, and that voice, that awful, grinding voice asking its horrifying question, was burned onto the inside of my eyelids.

I must have driven for an hour, maybe more, at speeds that should have gotten me killed or arrested, before the adrenaline started to fade, replaced by a bone-deep, shaking exhaustion that was more profound than any fatigue I’d ever known.
My hands were trembling so violently I could barely keep the wheel straight. Tears were streaming down my face – not from sadness, but from sheer, unadulterated terror and relief.

When the first hint of dawn started to grey the eastern sky, and my phone finally beeped, indicating a single bar of service, I pulled over at the first wide spot I could find. I practically fell out of the cab, vomiting onto the gravel until there was nothing left but dry heaves.
I sat there on the cold ground, shaking, for a long time, watching the sun come up, trying to convince myself that it had been a dream, a hallucination brought on by exhaustion.

But I knew it wasn’t. The detail of that tube. The voice. The question. You don’t hallucinate something that specific, that coherent, that utterly alien.

I never reported it. Who would I report it to? What would I say? ""Officer, I saw a little kid who was actually an ancient cosmic horror tethered to the woods by a nightmare umbilical cord, and it got mad because I didn't want to be its dinner?"" They’d have locked me up. Breathalyzed me, drug tested me, sent me for a psych eval.

I finished that run on autopilot. Dropped the load. Drove my rig back to the yard. And I quit.
I told them I was burned out, needed a break. They tried to convince me to stay, offered me different routes, more pay. I just couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that kid, that tube, those woods. Every dark road felt like a trap.

I found a local job, something that keeps me home at night. I don’t drive in remote areas anymore if I can help it. Especially not at night. I still have nightmares. Sometimes, when I’m very tired, driving home late from somewhere, I’ll see a flicker at the edge of my vision, on the side of the road, and my heart will try to beat its way out of my chest.

I don’t know what that thing was. An alien? A demon? Something else, something that doesn’t fit into our neat little categories? All I know is that it’s out there. And it’s patient. And it seems to have learned that its old tricks aren't as effective as they used to be.

""Why the fuck are humans smarter now?""

That question haunts me. It implies they weren’t always. It implies that, once upon a time, we were easier. That maybe, just maybe, people like me, tired and alone on dark roads, used to just step out of the cab when asked.
And were never seen again.

So, if you’re ever driving one of those long, lonely stretches of road, deep in the night, and you see something you can’t explain… Maybe just keep driving. Maybe being “smarter now” means knowing when not to stop. Knowing when to ignore that little voice telling you to help, because what’s asking for help might not be what it seems.

Stay safe out there. And for God’s sake, stay on the well-lit roads.",5625,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# I should start off by explaining myself.. 

Hi I’m Meave (I am 5’3, I have natural dirty blonde hair but I dye my hair black, with Hazel eyes but the kind where you can only tell in natural light.) I work as an assistant general manager of a gym and I am [REDACTED_NAME] nineteen. I moved out of My parents before I turned eighteen so I’ve been on my own for a little bit. Now before this story unfolds, I know these truths : I am [REDACTED_NAME] a good person, I know my actions have consequences, I am [REDACTED_NAME] innocent, I make tons of mistakes and I try my best to learn from everything in my life but I can’t always do that. I am [REDACTED_NAME] writing this for you to sympathize with me, I’m writing it so that you see my perspective. So you (Nash) know how I viewed you this whole time. 



At this point in my life I met Axel, Axel was kind of an accident if you could call him that. Axel would come into the gym every day with his friend Dominic. Starting off I had a big crush on Dominic (Dominic was 5 '5 Blonde hair, Baby Blue eyes and to best describe it he had a medium build.) The minute Dominic would step in the building my face would be so red it was obvious I was flustered. I gave Dominic my snapchat and he added me a week later, we talked and I tried flirting with him. It worked because he flirted back but I never got asked out, I was confused. Until he posted a picture of him and his girlfriend. I was shocked. I didn't know what to do and out of embarrassment, and the feeling of being undesirable I texted Axel on Facebook. Axel asked me for my snapchat and on Snapchat asked me questions about myself, truly got to know me and flirted with me. He asked for a “tattoo tour” Which I told him I could do but would be slightly inappropriate. He said it was preferred that way which was obvious his intentions at that point. The next day Axel and I hung out. Axel kissed me the Minute I stepped out of the car, I said “oh wow I never did this before so I thought this was going to be awkward..” Axel responded with “There is no awkwardness when it comes to me, don't worry.” After we would “hang out"" He brought me a glass of water and asked me if I wanted any fruits, which was an odd question to me because I didn't think that was normal I guess. I only ever had strawberries, kiwis, grapes and bananas so when he offered me blueberries I had to shamefully tell him how I never had them before. He brought me some and told me not to worry if I didn’t like them he would eat them. I actually enjoyed them. After that night it kinda became our thing, I believe we roughly met up three more times; Spanning over a couple of weeks. Every Time I saw him He gave me a new fruit, I might have actually developed feelings overtime for him. As I prefer to have permanent connections with people but that was only if I could get past his looks and focus on his personality. Problem was his personality, his narcissistic tendencies were only reminding me of Orion (Orion was my first boyfriend and ex-fiance.. Yes I was engaged. He was 6’2, Blonde hair and he had ocean blue eyes, but this isn’t about Orion let's get back to the story at hand). At one point Axel even called his mom, flipping out because he couldn’t get the netflix login to show me the new batman movie. I was definitely grossed out but I left it alone because we weren’t together. Me and Axel stopped hanging out for a good month or more at this point ( I had told my friends that he had given me the ick way too many times), I decided to drive up to New York to get my adopted sister Celeste, Celeste was beautiful but had a tough upbringing. I thought I could help her by bringing her home. I think I wanted to help Celeste more than she ever wanted from me though if I’m honest. The first month of Celeste being in town she made tons of friends, one of them made music his name was Dean. I finished up my workshift one night and randomly called Celeste asking her to come with me to Walmart, which was odd since it would require me to backtrack but something told me I needed her. She agreed, which she usually doesn’t like to do, so I feel this moment was fate. We were leaving walmart when Dean was entering, Dean was with a friend, He produced for Dean. His name was Nash, Nash and Dean were excited to talk to celeste as they had been talking about making a song recently. I was busy and uninterested so I walked to my car, I realized I shouldn’t be leaving Celeste with two random men, so I put my bags in the car and walked back over. I walked into their conversation asking Celeste to come over that night to make a song (it was already ten at night). She looked at me pleadingly and asked me to go too. I agreed because I would never leave a female alone with two men. So we left to go to Nash’s Studio

 We got to Nash’s Studio and I was trying to convince Celeste to talk to Nash since I thought he was cute. Nash (He had long blonde hair with blue eyes, but Nash would always say his eyes were gray not blue) I found him to be the most intriguing human I had ever met, I always hated long hair on men, but I loved him the way he was when I met him. Now Celeste had reminded me she had a boyfriend, she was frustrated with me. So I told her I was sorry and I then proceeded to introduce myself to Nash. I might be delusional but I could swear I saw his eyes light up when I sat next to him. I asked Nash about his profession, I asked him how he got into music and if he ever made his own songs. Nash showed me his songs but he swore he hated them, I reassured him. I asked him how he did it and he explained the whole process. Nash and I stayed up until five in the morning on a work night talking about everything. We clicked immediately, we had so much in common. Both being middle children with terrible past relationships. Nash was caring and considerate. Nash asked me where I worked and if I knew his brother, when he said Axel's name I knew…I didn’t think Nash had shared feelings for me so I didn’t tell him of the past I shared with Axel. I left that night and I brought home with me an understanding of spiritual intimacy, I felt understood for once in my life. Nash then texted me the next day asking if he could hear me sing something in his studio that night. I told him how I had stage fright so it had to be just him “I trust your producer ears” I said. He sent me a smiley face and agreed. Later that night he told me had to go pick up his friend from the airport and had to cancel but he texted me stating “unless you want to ride to the airport, which could be really boring”. I told him I kind of just wanted to talk to him more so I was okay with going with him. He picked me up in his moms car, he seemed nervous as he tried to figure out his GPS but also excited. He told me straight outwardly that he had feelings for me. I was shocked, I had never been with someone so sure of their own feelings. I told him I was interested in pursuing him as well, he had put his hand on my lap. I was so giddy, I believed this would last. Everything was great until the realization of Nash and Axel having the same last name….. I told Nash that I was friends with his brother. They were brothers, I would be wrong to keep it from him. That night as it came to an end, Nash and I somehow ended up on his couch cuddling, we even shared a kiss. My whole work shift I was thinking about the kiss Nash and I shared, and the elephant in the room. By the end of my shift I knew I had to tell Nash and I knew what that meant. I was crying my whole shift. I texted Nash and told him we needed to talk about something Important, in person. He questioned me and he was nervous, I felt like shit. By the end of the night I got to his house and we sat down in his studio. I couldn’t look him in the face, I was ashamed. I started to cry and told him I didn't want him to feel bad just because I was crying. I then told him about me and Axel’s past. To my dismay Nash cried. He was just as hurt as me, I apologized and told him I was a terrible person. How I was trying to follow my faith more and I keep falling further and further from it. Nash told me that he hoped I could understand but he couldn’t facilitate a relationship with someone  who once found his brother attractive. I shook my head, I asked him if we could at least be friends as I truly valued him as a friend. He said he needed time because it's hard for him to be friends with someone he had feelings for. I told him I understood and I left, we didn't speak all day. I cried my whole work shift, after work I started painting the house I just bought, my first night in the house. Nash texted me and asked if he could drop off celestes chargers and if we could talk when he got here. I agreed. Nash pulled in and we went for a drive, Nash asked me about Mine and Axel’s past. He asked if I ever had feelings for Axel and wanted to be with him. I expressed to him how Axel wasn’t my personality type, so I would never be interested. I expressed How he was barely even my type and I did it out of slight desperation. Nash and I talked for thirty minutes about this, He then brought me home and came inside with me. Nash and I sat on the floor of my empty living room, talking about everything. We laid down and stared at my ceiling, Nash said he felt pathetic. I asked why and he stated “I’ve been trying to feel bothered by you and Axel, but I can't. I think you truly regret it and I want to be with you”. I responded stating 'you're not pathetic, you are caring.’ Nash then kissed me. I thought time stopped and That's all I wanted, I wanted to be stuck in that moment forever.

 Everytime Nash kissed me, he would grab my face with both his hands as if I was the most fragile thing in the world. Nash and I spent everyday together. We went to Dean's house together and I signed Dean's pizza poster. Dean said I’m an official friend so I was allowed, Dean was a great friend during all of this. I was hanging out with Nash one day and my dad called me asking to pick up his groceries because he started drinking and forgot. I asked Nash if it was okay and he agreed. I was slightly panicked because my father had never met any of my boyfriends before. Not even my Ex-fiancé. Nash helped carry the bags in and shook my dads hand. My dad, being old him, was drunk and gave Nash his whole life's story… My dad told Nash how he dropped out in high school to take care of my mother and her newborn. I watched as Nash got excited, and asked what grade he dropped out. Nash found out they both dropped out Junior year, Nash was worried my dad would judge him for it and was relieved to hear my dad wasn't going to be disappointed. It made me happy to see my dad and Nash getting to know each other, it all felt real after that. 



Nash and I shared so many special and important moments, we had so many serious conversations and started to build a real foundation to our relationship. I was hypersexual and Nash realized it quickly.. He didn't have a problem with it and he actually stated how he would have to be the one in past relationships to introduce the intimate parts of the relationship. Making him feel undesirable. One night I was cuddling Nash and asked if we could be intimate; He looked at me and asked me if I had ever been shown love without the expectation of more. I thought for a second and realized I hadn’t, so I replied with a simple “no”. He said “let's just cuddle and watch movies tonight. I don't want you to feel like all I want you for is intimacy.” I didn’t realize until after reflecting on our conversations Nash thought I regretted being with him, Which he was so utterly wrong about. I know I made him feel that way when I would cry about us not being “official” but sleeping together. Nash said he had been thinking about it a lot and I didn't realize what kind of damage I did by wording it that way. I never regretted him, I regretted Axel and I was full of shame. I just wanted to be with Nash and not keep it a secret. Nash tried to tell Axel, Axel reacted badly. Nash said “Maeve is coming over tonight…” This was the first time Axel found out we were hanging out. Axel’s face turned red and he responded with “You know I F\*cked her right?!”. Nash was slightly embarrassed and said “yea, she told me.” Axel said “Did you f\*ck her…” Nash sighed “yes..”. I didn't know this was the conversation when I walked in.. Axel looked me dead in the eyes and said “speak of the devil''. I awkwardly chuckled and said “hi”. Axel and Nash wrapped up their conversation and I went with Nash into his room. Nash and I were talking when Axel yelled for him.. From the other room Axel asked Nash to not let me spend the night.. When Nash told me I felt disgusted and Ashamed, I guess that was the point for Axel. Which I should have expected, Axel was a narcissist and there was no hiding that side of him, I could tell he didn't know he was though. I damaged Axels Ego because without the knowledge of Nash. I texted Axel the night I told Nash everything and I told Axel how I was feeling.. I said to Axel “I just wanna be honest with you really quickly. Hanging Out with Nash I developed feelings for him, I already told him about us hooking up, which means he no longer wants to be involved with me, with that being said I cannot ever see you again. Knowing how I feel now. You're a good person but I genuinely feel I wish I had met Nash before ever meeting you. I apologize for everything.” Axel screenshotted my message that night.. I thought he sent it to Nash but Nash told me he never got that message from Axel so he didn't even know I had sent it. I think I broke Axel's ego that night, and I severely pissed him off. 

Axel’s reactions to My relationship with Nash was the beginning to our end. Nash wasn’t willing to hinder his relationship with his brother as Nash worked with Axel and lived with him. I couldn’t even be mad, I knew our relationship was a long shot to begin with but I was a hopeless romantic. Nash gave me hope…. Until Nash and I were cuddling on my couch about to pass out when Nash got up to leave. I asked Nash why he could stay and he stated he didn't want Axel to know where he was.. I was angry. I told Nash he was just delaying the inevitable at this point then. I said if he never talked to Axel then we aren't going to work out. Nash saw a tear streaming down my face and sat back down. He said “you’re right. I thought this fork in the road was going to be something we could get past but Axel isn’t bugging.” He paused and said “ I feel like I’m leading you on”. I started to Bawl my eyes out, I stopped talking. Nash asked me to stand up and I shook my head no. I felt too vulnerable to stand. Nash said “can I sit with you then?” I shook my head yes. He sat next to me and held me while I cried. I mustered up the courage to say “I feel like I’m being punished” The tears ran faster down my face, then I felt Nash gasp and start crying out “I think I’m being punished too”. We cried together. Both aching. I thought this can't be the end. We cried for a bit and Nash had to leave before things felt worse. I stopped Nash from leaving and placed my house key in his hand. I said “Please talk to Axel, just tell him I want to be in a relationship with you and if he reacts badly blame me for being crazy. If you get through to him instead then there is no harm. Keep my key and if it goes bad you can bring it back, but if there's still a chance of us being together, keep it.” He hesitantly agreed. Now I want to say that was the last time I saw Nash face to face, but I did end up seeing him one more time. Nash stopped making plans and efforts to see me after our conversation, things just slightly changed. When I asked him what was going on, he simply stated “I’m just really busy with work this week”. So I trusted it was that, I gave it time and in hopes he would make an effort to reach out. I heard nothing back, I got snapchat clips here and there of what he was doing but there was a lack of interest in keeping conversation. I was distraught. I told my therapist and she told me to give him that week in case it really is work and the stress of having two jobs, so I did. I ended up visiting my cousin Jackie and her boyfriend. They always welcomed me into their home with open arms, Jacklyn's boyfriend Trevor had edibles when I got there and asked me if I wanted one. I was sad and bored so I said “fuck it”, he gave me one and an hour later I felt nothing. I asked him for more and he let me help myself. I then ate two more. I started to feel the effect immediate and asked Nash to pick me up and take me home before I got sick. Nash agreed and came to get me, now I don’t remember much of that night but what I do I am [REDACTED_NAME] of. I threw up, my cousin gave me a puke bag to leave with. Nash was driving me home and I felt myself becoming sick, Nash had his hand on my lap and I puke into my bag. Which was right over his hand. Next thing I know I’m in my tub, and then somehow in my bedroom. I only remember us talking two times that night. Once in the car when he took a wrong turn and he said “ its okay, I’m not in a rush.” Now I don't remember if I responded to him at that point. The second time we spoke I was in my bedroom puking (NAKED BECAUSE I WAS OVERHEATING AND DUMB) and I remember telling him he didn’t need to stay and watch over me. He asked if I was sure and he left, I don't recall anything more from that night. A week later nothing changed so I asked him if he was avoiding me. He told me “No, I haven't been avoiding you. I have felt a bit off about us lately, though. Been trying to wait till I have words to articulate exactly what's up & That just hasn't happened yet.” I replied with “ Off as in, you just aren't interested any longer? Or Off as in you aren't sure what to do because of the Axel situation”. Now what he replied with shattered my heart as I thought this was something I wouldn't need to feel worried about, because if it was I wouldn’t have risked my own feelings getting hurt. He said “ I’m Talking about you guys having sex. I thought I’d stop thinking about it but I haven’t. Truthfully it's been starting to make me a bit uncomfortable lately. The whole Axel’s reaction thing doesn’t make it any easier but in my own mind it’s becoming harder to deal with”. My mind began to race a million miles a minute. How is this something all of the sudden, when he told me he couldn’t even force himself to feel upset about it? Was he lying this whole time?

Did I ever really know Nash..

Up until this point I thought Nash and I thought the same, I thought I knew him as I know myself because of the way we clicked, which I now feel I was wrong about. I was hurting, all my insecurities peaked through and by the end of the night I was eating Laxatives because I was consumed with the thought of “if I was pretty enough, if I was skinny enough.” Now let me explain something, Nash never said I was fat, he never said anything damaging about myself, that was all my brain. I have borderline personality disorder, when I feel something I feel it so strongly the best way to describe it is like this. Point One, I have a favorite person and their mood and actions make my mood, I idealize my favorite person. Point Two, when I lose a friend because of a fight or especially a significant other, It feels like they died, I grieve for an entire person who is very much alive. So that night I ate 3 Laxatives to “be skinny” and then texted my friend Anais and asked if she would come over because I found out you can indeed overdose from Laxative and I didn’t want to die, I just wanted to look skinny again. I posted about it on my girl's private story which Nash was on because I don't believe in keeping secrets from someone you are in a relationship with. Let me reiterate we weren’t together, we were talking but I treat talking stages and dating the same. It's the same respect regardless. Nash then watched my story and deleted me, I could only assume he thought the worst, which was entirely my fault. All of my friends knew about my laxative problems except him. Once Nash deleted me, I grieved him. I had to, my BPD doesn’t allow it any other way. So for me someone I cared for so deeply was lost, I would never see or speak to him again and I had to find a way to deal with that. I obviously knew he was very much alive, but I grieve for him still.  About two weeks later a gift I ordered for Nash (for Valentines day) came in, I forgot all about it as it shipped late. When I opened the package I saw a custom Neon sign that said “Nash’s Studio” and “2024” as I had it custom made for him. I cried and my friends told me to smash it, but I hold no resentment toward Nash as he did nothing wrong, He was honest. I texted Nash’s friend Dean, I explained how I just wanted Nash to have it. I asked Dean to do me the favor of lying and saying it's from him instead, as I didn’t want Nash to believe it was a way for me to get back into his life. It was simply something I wanted him to keep. Dean agreed as he stated it was “the saddest shit he ever heard”. I dropped it off and from that point forward I decided to not think about Nash. Until… 



Nash reached out to me about a month later… March 13th.

  Now because I thought I’d never hear from him again, when he added me I thought Dean for sure told Nash about the sign. I panicked and texted Dean before Nash even finished typing. I said “hey is there any chance you told Nash about the sign?”. Dead said “no way, why what’s up”. I explained and he said “keep me updated!”, I agreed. Since I had only ever been with Narcissists when Nash started typing a felt a pit in my stomach, I thought “shit what did I do, Did I piss him off?” no. Instead he reached out saying “Was it you I was arguing with about the long exposure thing on iPhones?”, replied with “yea why what happened? Did you figure it out?”. He said “I found this” and sent me a beautiful picture of the sky. Anyone who knows me knows I will stop anywhere to take a picture of the sky, moons, clouds, etc.. I thought “ Wow he was thinking of me?”. He kept conversation that night and the next three days, but I was confused about his intentions and scared of getting my hopes up so I tried to stay talking as if it was a friend. I did ask him for my house key back, I said “hey do you happen to still have my house key?”  He replied with “Yea,I know I didn’t throw it away but I have to find it, Why?”. I thought this response was odd as the only reason a sane person would ask about their house key would be for it back… So I said “ Well I figured I would get more use out of it then you since you don't come over, unless you want to?” he said “oh okay”. I then said “ will you look for it?” he agreed. I texted him about it again a couple of days later, to which he told me he found it. I asked him if i could meet up to get it off him that day but he said he was too busy with work… Which I found odd as I could have picked it up from his house, he could walk it outside, or have a mutual friend bring it to me? I brushed it off though. That following weekend I was off that Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I informed him of my availability, I said to him “ Hey I don’t work tomorrow, Saturday or Sunday if you have time and wanna meet up, you can come to my house or I can drive to you! (For my key ofc!)”



 he said “ ayo sorry I never responded - I gotta let you know though I’m talking to someone & out of respect for her I shouldn’t meet up with you I hope you understand”. 



I said “Okay that’s fine if possible you could drop it off in my mailbox or something?”. No response. A couple days went by and I texted him asking a question for a friend of mine, he left me open. The next time I went to message Nash he had deleted me. There was no after Nash for me, no new talking stage, no boyfriend. Nothing. I know I should have moved on but there just felt like that was possible, I was stuck wondering. I started working out more and spending more time with my friends. I tried to distract myself, as I don’t expect Nash to come back. A part of me doesn’t want him to because I know he deserves better, but a part of me also believes I can be better for him if given the opportunity, Which is kind of pathetic if you ask me. I haven’t heard from Nash since this, but a few weeks ago….. I found out I was pregnant, which I know what you're thinking “how didn’t you know until now, after all this time?”. I never had regular periods, I am [REDACTED_NAME] allowed on certain birth controls because of the adverse effects and I struggle a lot with that part of  me. So for me to have a late period isn't unusual, to have a short period isn't unusual either. I had a two day period in February and I haven’t had a period since. I thought nothing of it until I noticed slight changes in me. It's a bit of too much information but my nipples/ areolas changed in color, I was craving pickles and ice cream. My moods were constantly fluctuating and I almost always felt sick and wanted to cry. I decided to take a pregnancy test on April 24th. It was positive, I called my obgyn and she told me to take one the next day and a week later since she knew I had a lot of health issues. So On April 25th, the 28th and May 4th, I had all positive pregnancy tests. As this was my first pregnancy and the last thing I wanted was my family to know I kept it to just my friends. I tried to reach out to my obgyn to set up an appointment but she never answered and I left a voicemail. I didn’t know what to do or who to contact so I was waiting until my day off to go to the doctors even if it was just a walk in, my time off was for May 15th. I needed to make sure my baby was healthy. That day never came though, I had extremely bad stomach pains, it felt like a piercing needle was going through my stomach all the way to my spine. I started bleeding, at this point I already miscarried the day before at the gym. When I was getting up from the toilet I saw it but I didn't get to inspect what it was before the auto flush…. I was in denial. On May 11th, I went to the hospital. At the hospital I found out I had miscarried, I remember the doctor explaining it all to me and trying to help me through it, I was just thinking while staring off. I recall him saying “this is a lot of information to take in at once, how are you doing you feeling okay?”. Now in my head I am [REDACTED_NAME] through so much and They took a lot of blood from me. I truly couldn’t concentrate and I wanted to cry. I sarcastically chuckled and scoffed “yea”. He repeated his question of “are you okay?” and I said “yes.” He asked if I had any more questions but I couldn't speak, My cousin Jacklyn was with me and started asking him all the important stuff. This whole Time I was trying so hard to figure out how to tell Nash about the baby while he was in a relationship, I was so stressed about it that I feel like I didn't appreciate it. Nash you had every right to know, I wish I could have told you. I wish I found out sooner and got to meet our baby. This now is my biggest regret, because no matter how you would have reacted all I wanted was to meet my baby. Our baby I don't mean to be possessive. I then had to find a way to tell you about it all. Knowing your past relationship traumas I knew you dont believe most things, thankfully I kept a tract of it all. I sent it all to my close friend Anastasia, she wanted to give you more specifics but I told her it wasn't necessary because for some reason I thought you were going to hate me. For not telling you right away, for losing it, I guess I thought you would Hate me for losing our baby. I hated me for the loss of my baby, why shouldn’t you. I was bleeding through an overnight pad every hour for two weeks before it slowed down. I was visibly ill and stressed, I didn’t need more negative reactions from anyone, and I especially couldn’t handle it from you. I was scared, Anastasia said “ he texted back 7 times” she read it to me, I could see your thought process. She read to me “Nash said”... “How long did she know?” “scratch that”, “ I don't need to know”, “Is she Okay?”.... “ as okay as I assuming”, “with everything going on”.  A sense of relief came over me as I realized he didn’t blame me for the loss. Anastasia looked at me as she was reading this to me and said “I’m going to respond and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] lying to him about how you are doing. I’m gonna be honest.”. She knows me all too well, Anastasia knows I don't like to be looked at like a puppy with a broken leg. She's like fire though and she won’t let anyone put that out, not even me. Nor did I want to, I loved her for being so honest to me. I couldn’t ask her to reserve the best part of her. I still to this day don’t know what she said about me though, Its my mystery. I do know Anastasia said Nash said he had no ill feelings towards me, that he respected me for telling him and needed time to process this. Which I obviously completely understood, then he told Anastasia he was deleting her from his snapchat so that his friends and family (and as you would assume girlfriend) won't see it. As he never locked his phone. 

That is the last I heard from Nash, to recap no key was returned. No hatred , no ill feelings. Just genuine care. I hope you processed this and it doesn’t hurt you the way it does me, I know the pain of losing a child is a lot harder for women than men. As we feel physical as well as mental pains, I do hope you care for the child that could have been even if you ever lose care for me. You taught me I am [REDACTED_NAME], That mistakes can be forgiven, and that even if you aren't in my life, to look for a love like you. If you weren’t a lesson before I definitely learned one now. 

  


You deserve to know. I loved you, I still do; You will forever have part of my heart. I cry for you, ache for you, and retouch our memories that slowly fade away as quickly as you breathe. I know I was important to you as you were to me. I will forever hold our memories and take them out on rainy days to remember the feeling of the love you gave me. I still talk to you, without your knowledge of course. We all make choices, good or bad; we tend to forget that our choices affect other people too. I'm [REDACTED_NAME], I thought I was protecting you.

Forgive me. I know we will never be the same, but I will always feel the same. You're like a song I will forever have on replay, always my favorite. My secrets....you deserved to know.

wgwdgs,1659708369,8/5/2022 14:06,offmychest,In need of constant validation,"It is a long story, so I hope you are patient. I am [REDACTED_NAME] my 50s and have a family - a wife, two grown up children, reasonably well settled in life. From my early childhood I have been very ambitious. As a result I have taken on ambitious projects with zero results to show for it. My ambitions far outstrip my abilities. Any project I take up, whether it is a professional one or one in my personal life, I can't think small. I can't think of what needs to be done here and now; instead I think of boiling the ocean. The results are very predictable. I end up failing to do even the simplest of the tasks. I get bored of mundane work and seek novelty and interesting tasks - which stop being interesting after a while. I still believe my best days are yet to come and I have something to contribute to the humanity which has given me so much. So I will keep striving to find myself and live up to my true potential to my last day.

One of my earliest memories is that of my mother admonishing for picking my nose. I must have been 3 or 4 and I was sleeping next to her. She noticed I was picking my nose and she got disgusted. She scolded me and sent me over to sleep next to my dad. I cried myself to sleep. I still remember that event very vividly. It was a very traumatizing experience. I have never been able to overcome that nose picking habit. Of course I don't do it in public, but it persists.

I was sexually abused by a couple of my relatives. One was male and the other female. It started when I was just 2 or 3 and continued well into my early teens, especially with my male relative. This was not traumatic in the sense that I willingly participated and somehow knew to hide it from other adults. I don't know if my subsequent sex and porn addiction had anything to do with it. I am [REDACTED_NAME] narrating to make sure I give you a complete picture.

Otherwise my childhood was pretty normal. I grew up playing with lots of other kids; I had no siblings of my own. I was pretty good academically up to my high school graduation, so I was always at the top or near the top in my class. It was a different story once I went to study electrical engineering and I struggled. Even so I finished in four years and got a very good job right off campus, so it was alright.

From my teenage years, I have found it hard to maintain good friendships. Even those who persisted with me for decades eventually gave up and stopped interacting with me. It has happened again and again. For a long time I blamed it on others. It is their fault, they failed to see the good person that I am [REDACTED_NAME] so on. In that respect I am [REDACTED_NAME] similar to my mother. She has suffered chronic inferiority complex due to her childhood issues and people end up shunning her. She has become very bitter in her 70s and now she is all alone because my father passed away recently.

I had a lot of difficulty in developing friendships with girls of my age. I was a different person at that time; very arrogant and sometimes even insulting. By the time I learned about emotional intelligence and getting along with others, I was well into my 30s. I had a couple of short term relationships in the meanwhile, but none of them satisfactory. There was one girl I was madly in love with, but unfortunately she was way out of my league. But she was kind enough to give my proposal a serious consideration. I literally had palpitations for a couple of nights after she said no; I could barely get any sleep. I was in total denial - I thought I could somehow convince her to reconsider. Her rejection was a very bitter pill; I suffered serious psychosomatic effects for many years. Even today I think about her. In retrospect it was a good decision from her perspective; she wouldn't have been happy with me.

Once I started working I began noticing a pattern: my colleagues had no difficulty getting other jobs though they were no better than my in the work we did. It took me twice as long to find the next job. In the initial years my inability to focus on tasks and get meaningful work done was hidden because people don't expect much from you when you are young. However, as I started taking on more responsible positions my failures became more obvious. I started my own company and, as a CEO, I was a spectacular failure. However, my young partners were very enterprising and eventually they got fed up and sent me packing. I moved on and found a job. My inability to focus and deliver persists to this day and I have not met any of my career or personal objectives though I have always set myself ambitious goals.

I eventually found love and married someone who is still my wife. Our relationship has been rocky but she has persisted. Now we are husband and wife in name only. I am [REDACTED_NAME] amazed that she is still with me though she has threatened to leave many times. For most of our married life, I was not an easy person to live with but always believed I was right. After a lot of reflection and thought, I have realized mostly I am [REDACTED_NAME] fault and I need to make amendments. Relations with my children are cordial but I would not describe them as warm. Their relationship with me is similar to mine with my mother which is out of a sense of duty rather than true love.

I have done many things in my life to improve myself: starting with attending Landmark workshops to reading books like ""I am [REDACTED_NAME] you are ok"", ""7 habits of highly effective people"", ""Emotional Intelligence"", ""Grit"" and many many more. I have seriously tried meditation. Nothing has helped. I recently sought counseling and consulted for several months. But I realized that their counseling is not useful because they are not trained to do deep psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. My issues are probably much deeper.

I have always known that I seek approval form others, I just didn't know why. I would find even the smallest of insults, someone just pulling my leg, enough of a reason to get very upset. Of course, over the years I have matured and consciously deal with such situations, but it is still hard. The reality is that people don't want to validate others. They have their own lives to live and have no time to think of others' issues or understand why someone behaves the way they do. I didn't understand my own personality or behavior patterns so it is a tall order for someone else to do so.

I have sought help from my close friends, family members and others. Without actually knowing I needed help, I talked honestly about my feelings and behaviors in group settings as far back as my early 20s. However, such talk makes people uncomfortable. They either deny that you are as bad as you say you are, or just keep quiet.

Another issue I have faced all my life is addiction. At various times, I have been addicted to reading fiction, porn and sex, watching videos online etc. It is those videos that keep me occupied these days. I need constant distraction from work and sometimes even from other distractions. It is really pathological. Given this level of propensity for distraction I have lost the capability to think deeply about anything whether it is professional or personal work. It clearly reflects in how I do things. There is no wonder that my managers, coworkers etc perceive me as incompetent.

I know I am [REDACTED_NAME] now, so let me come to the punch line, or the punch paragraph. I listen to Huberman Lab podcast. In one such podcast, Dr. Huberman focused on dopamine and its impact on our lives. He explains how certain foods, drugs, experiences increase the dopamine levels in the body. How it regulates mood and motivation and baseline levels, effects of crashing dopamine etc. (If you haven't listened to Dr. Huberman, please do. He is an amazing scientist and a great human being). That got me thinking. Is there a possibility that I have a chronic deficiency in dopamine? Once I was talking to my son about my lack of motivation and focus and he immediately said, you probably lack dopamine.

After thinking about it for many years, I decided to experiment with marijuana. After several attempts, once I had a dose that had a big impact on me but it was not you might expect. Immediately after consuming it, I didn't feel anything different; just a mild high similar to drinking alcohol. But soon after I felt very depressed and completely lacked motivation to do anything. At the same time I received a call from a dear friend who had not called in months. Usually I would be very happy to talk to him, but in this case I just had no interest. I immediately realized it was the dopamine crash. My dopamine regulation is somehow defective. My 23andme report says I potentially have a gene defect that causes chronic dopamine deficiency. That could explain why I need constant distractions; moving from one task to another, one stimulation to another because I am [REDACTED_NAME] low on dopamine. I seek approval from others because that is known to increase dopamine levels. I am a very sensitive person and can't tolerate even minor insults because of the same reasons.

Currently I am [REDACTED_NAME] with many different things to keep my dopamine levels in check: I take phenylethylamine or PEA supplement. I have tried cold showers. Tried to reduce my frequent consumption of social media and youtube. It is an on-going struggle. I may again get back into counseling, this time with a psychotherapist who can go deeper into my childhood and provide better tools.

If you are still with me, my sincere thanks to you. I do hope I can make some friends here. There is also a part of me which seeks your likes and approval. Most importantly I hope my story helps others to develop some insights into their own situations if they are similar.

Signing off for now.",2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1gn0rf7,1731122050,11/9/2024 3:14,offmychest,I cut contact with my brother bc that idiot choose his entitled gf over our mother (who has cancer),"**Note:** This is a repost of my first post ever, that was on another subreddit, with an additional explanation at the end, since I wanted to add more clarifications about my brother and Stacy's behavior

Sooooo, I need everyone to buckle up bc this is gonna be a looong story. I have been fuming for months now and need an anonymous way to vent my frustrations.

I (f, turning 21 soon) was never really close to my brother (m, 19). Maybe it's a siblings thing or the fact that our personalities are too different, whatever it may be, I always felt like he was acting close to me only when he needed help with schoolwork and he basically avoided, ignored or even bullied me when I was ""not useful"". Needless to say, that type of behavior never made me want to be close to him - and I have already made peace with that.

What baffles me, however is the that, despite being super close with our mom (f, 47), sometimes almost to the point of being mamma's boy, he started to be distant and later ignored our mom, despite her getting diagnosed with eye cancer and having her left eye completely removed, just bc his girlfriend was super controlling and honestly, jealous (even tho we are his family and not her competition - but girlie is kinda crazy, what can I say).

Now, I need to add some additional context - our mom is a single parent, she raised us basically on her own, as our father was an alcoholic with a tendency to be violent towards my mom, which is why she divorced him when I was 6, and he died of a heart attack 2 years after that (he was on heart meds before and you're not allowed to drink while being on those meds, so basically he dug his own grave). Our father was never a 'dad' to us, he was almost not present in our lives and just gave us trauma, tho I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure how much of that my brother remembers since he was young (4 when they started the divorce) and mom tried to somehow shield us from abuse, even making sure that I took my brother to a safer place - so in that way he was sorta shielded from all the abuse.

I specifically wanted to mention that bc my mom, tho she tried her best to raise us as good people and to treat both of us equally, always sorta shielded my brother, since he was younger and a ""problem"" child, whereas I was ""easier"" to raise since I mentally matured earlier than my peers, was a lot more self-sufficient and never needed help with schoolwork and such. I even went to high school at a different city (my country's capital city), staying at student dorms and then continued to do the same since I started university - up untill last year at least.

So let's introduce my brother's gf into the story now, let's call her Stacy (obviously not her real name, tho even if I did put her name she would never know since neither of them speak English). Stacy is a year younger than my brother, they have been dating for 2,5 years now (not as problematic in my country and also since they were both minors at the time they started dating, as far as I know, and also bc the difference is like just a year) and have meet through their mutual friends, since we are all from the same village and we kinda went to the same elementary/ middle school (one 8 year schooling institution in my country; followed by 4 years for high school). Both my brother and Stacy went to high schools in a nearby cities, traveling from home since it's like half an hour by bus for my brother and a bit longer for her.

Since begging I wasn't really close with Stacy, as she was complete opposite from me personality wise and also bc I wasn't even that close with my brother and I was at dorms most of the time, coming home like once a month or every two months. Their relationship developed quite fast - they even slept over at her or our family houses not even few months into the relationship. I expressed concerns over this fast development to my mom, since they were both young and this was like second relationship my brother had and he was getting progressively more and more simp-like towards Stacy as time went on.

Now, don't get me wrong, I don't really care about them that much buuut I was concerned bc my brother would spend all the money he earned working part-time and later, after high school, full-time on Stacy, and would also make my mom take Stacy with her when she went shopping for clothes ""to buy her something too"". To me this whole situation seemed to be out of hand since we're not in the best financial situation, and, while my mom never asked my brother for his money or made him pay for our household bills, she never expected she would have to pay for stuff for his gf too. Also, tbh, Stacy kinda struck me as someone with main character syndrome, since her behavior was super entitled - for example, last year when she found out my mom and I went shopping for winter jackets without her (both of us had our jackets for a while and needed new ones, not that it matters since it was never her business to begin with), she made my brother buy her not one, not two, but 4 jackets and a coat for that winter. *This is just one example, I have plenty more but I think this one shows her character well*.

To continue the story, I have to say that Stacy never really liked me and always saw me as a competition (idk why honestly). She would always make jabs at me in every conversation, so I would always avoid talking to her too much, tho that was impossible when she stayed at our house. Then, last year from Sept to early Jan this year, her behavior got even worse and, after a fight over a bed (I'll get to that) that she somehow had on her own, without ever voicing her complaints to me, she made my brother move in with her and her whole family (*very messy family, I would have to talk for days if I started talking about them too*).

Bed thing: *We don't have one house but kinda like two houses next to each other, with like a front and back yard. This 'house' belonged to my late maternal grandpa, who we stayed with after mom's divorce and basically till his death. Now, only one of those houses is heated during winter and we squeeze there to save up on heating. Stacy and my brother would have separate room when they were at our place, my late grandpa's room to be specific (important later) and my mom would sleep in living room area right next to that room. I was at dorm and would only come for weekends sometimes, so I slept on a pull-out couch in the large guest room area that was a bit colder that that main area, which I never minded that much but my mom would always feel sorry to me. Last December I came home, this time to stay, since I left dorm and was gonna travel to uni from home - decision I made since my mom was working and tired all the time, needed help with house and all, and the two of them were far from helpful and, in fact, just made more mess bc they almost never did any housework. Anyway, the day I came back was Saturday, mom and I were tired from the move and, since my brother and Stacy weren't staying over, I just put their beddings to wash, put mine in that room and slept there. Now, I have to say - it's not first time this happened, I was too tired and my mom also wanted me to be closer to her so we could chat and she also didn't want me to have to pull out the couch and basically sleep in a colder room when I had a free bed. No one had any issues with this, this is my house after all - well, no one but Stacy. Apparently, she didn't like that I slept in ""her"" bed. Again, this is my house and again, this was my grandpa's room before he died, meaning he slept in that bed, later my brother slept in that bed, and like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] at some point my mom slept there too. I changed beddings to my own, theirs needed to be washed anyway. She was not there at that time. I truly didn't and still don't see the issue here. And to reiterate, she actually got pissed at me on her own, never told me that to my face, but decided to make my brother move in with her and her whole family and then she texted my mom some vague messages about how she felt ""disrespected"". So yeah, girlie doesn't like me for no reason, got mad at me bc of a bed and decided to just isolate my stupid simp of a brother from his family instead of, idk, acting like a normal person and maybe talking to me if she has any issues. Buuuuut no, that's bellow her.*

So anyway, from Jan to early June this year, my brother was distancing himself from mom and I, which truly hurt mom since she felt abandoned and like he choose Stacy over his own family. In June my brother stopped contacting me and in early July he also cut contact with mom, which was even scummier bc mom went to a different country in May, trying to find better work opportunities. All in all, my mom messaged him a lot to try to contact him to see how he was, but he acted like an idiot and ignored her, which broke her heart a bit.

In mid August, my mom came on a sorta 'vacation' back home while she waited for her work visa papers to be processed and during that time she found out she had an eye cancer. Since it was inside her eye, they decided it was for the best to remove her eye completely and then extract part of it and test if it's malign, instead of first poking it to extract some and making it worse if it is. My mom was obviously shocked, but decided to be strong. She wanted to tell my brother too and, if possible, make up with him somehow, just in case things go bad (both my maternal grandparents died from some sort of cancer, so this obviously made her afraid of the worst outcome).

My, brother, the as--ole that he is, however, was super cold at these life altering news once he heard them. First of all, we had to visit my paternal grandpa and contact my brother through him to arrange the whole meeting. Then he was super cold at the news, despite my mom basically crying in his arms when she was telling him the news. And lastly, even after these news, he still never contacted mom to see how she was.

My mom decided to somehow give him another chance in a way and visited him once more, at the end of Sept, right before the surgery. During that meeting he didn't pay attention to the fact that his own mother is gonna have a surgery where they'll remove her eye, but decided it was the best time to ask if mom can go with him to change his SIM card from mom's to his name, so he can get a new phone, probably for Stacy, since he mentioned she broke hers recently. Mind you, my mom has only recently paid off his phone and also, that phone number belonged to my late grandpa and my brother just took it since it was convinient to use, so my mom rightfully said no, whish just pissed him off and he didn't even listen to anything afterwards.

Yup, that's right - getting a freaking new phone for freaking Stacy is more important than his mother (who btw died on the operating table while giving birth to him and had to be revived) having a lifechanging surgery.

At that point, even my mom realized what an as- he is and decided to just prioritize her health first. She had her surgery, everything went okay and since then she has been at home, resting and recovering while waiting to get results and her first prosthetic eye (she's getting it next Monday and then she'll meet with her doctor, find out the results from tissue analysis and discuss next treatment plan).

The reason why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] more pissed off and decided to vent here is the fact that, a few days ago, my idiotic brother made my paternal grandpa call us and ask if my mom truly had surgery and if he could talk with her (I know that my brother made my grandpa do this since I could hear him and Stacy in the background, instructing my grandpa on what to say to me over the phone). Soooo, the idiot somehow thought my mom was, idk, faking it or smth and only when he heard from the villlage gossip that my mom had her eye removed did he actually believe it. I just told grandpa the truth - yes, she had surgery and no, my mom was not able to talk to that, as at that time she was resting after taking her meds.

I have no words for this poor excuse of a human being, I can not comprehend how he is my brother and honestly, although most of my family, including my mom, say that he only changed after getting together with Stacy, I don't think I could ever talk to him. I don't think I'll ever forgive him for this level of disrespect towards the woman that gave him his life and did his best to raise him despite our shitty circumstances. I truly have no words for this, I just needed a place to rant, I have been trying to hold in my feelings, since I have to be there for my mom rn and I just don't wanna see her sad.

Anyway, this is the shortest version of my current situation, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my mom's surgery went well and hope that she gets better soon. As for the two pieces of s--t that are my brother and Stacy, I just want to not have to talk to them anymore, I have had enough of their craziness.

**Additional clarifications:** I decided to add this, even tho it's gonna make this already long story even longer. However, I want to provide additional context:

Stacy is very, how do I put it, self-absorbed type, but her actions are not limited to just petty comments or using my simp brother. She didn't like me since she knew she's not gonna get anything from me and bc she was jealous bc she wasn't the center of my own mother's attention when I was at home, since my mom wanted to spend every moment she could with me bc at that time I lived at dorm in a different city. She would always try to insert herself into our conversations and make it about her. I never cared to respond, since I saw through her and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a non-confrontational type unless someone pushes my buttons. And she did, a lot, which is why I expressed my concerns to my mom. I said the same to my brother but he didn't care to even listen, so I continued to ignore both of them until she started being that way towards my mom too and her behavior became even worse.

There are many more example's of her having a main character syndrome, including the time she threatened to break up with my brother bc she was jealous of one girl in his class that was appointed to go to prom with him (prom s a grade level event, usually people from same class are arranged together based on number of people in that grade and how many of them are male/ female; my brother actually escorted two girls but she was jealous only of the ""prettier"" one), which made my brother text and call mom, on the night of his prom that was in another city and not where we actualy live (event is made up of like grand exit from school, then they take special busses to the venue and after the event they return to school area, where parents pick them up), to drive there and pick him up bc ""he'll ki\*l himself if she breaks up with him"" (ofc mom didn't go, she just told him to enjoy his night as this is an important event he'll always remember and that she'll pick him up from school when they all return there by bus). He's not sui\*idal, this is just manipulation tactic that he knows will hurt mom's feelings and, honestly, it hurt mine a lot too bc, unlike him, I am [REDACTED_NAME] with depression and anxiety, and I do have sui\*dal thoughts sometimes. So yeah, both of them are shi\*ty people and I wish I could say this only happened once.

Other such events just kept happening: there was the time she got mad bc of the color of my dress; then her wanting to be center of attention at someone else's (my female cousin's) 18th b-day (important in my country bc then you're officially an adult, it's often celebrated like a big event, people get dressed up and basically celebrate that person's b-day in a grandiose way); she also body shamed me basically for being ""too thin"" and commented on my food choices; and etc. I really don't wanna keep going on. The point is - I would get hurt, obviously, but I mostly tried to ignore her unless she said stuff to me directly bc I decided not to engage with her behavior and give her more of that attention that she cares so much for.

However, the thing that def crossed every one of my lines is when she started being bit\*hy towards my mom too, following that bed incident I mentioned above. She texted my mother a lot, and I mean a lot, saying how she's ""disrespected"" and when my mom didn't, idk, apologize to her, she started making my brother avoid talking to his own mother or, when he did, she would watch over him and basically interrupt him or limit the amount of time he spent with mom.

Now, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] saying it's my brother is innocent nor am I defending him in any way, I just find this so scummy. My mom is a really emotional person (sometimes overly so), so this type of thing really got to her. Stacy's behavior escalated to straight up listening to, like in a way overseeing, my brother's calls with mom and one night she even grabbed the phone from his hand and started jelling at my mother, simply bc she mentioned she wanted to see her son and wanted him to move back.

One thing to keep in mind - my mom wanted my brother to come back bc she missed him but she never said anything about making him break up with Stacy. We all sat down as a family once prior to most of this and after bed thing, as always in these like family meetings we were all open, mom and I expressed our concerns (politely and non-confrontationally) to him, but he just stormed out of the house and refused to listen. So even this jelling didn't seem to bother him.

At that point I was over them, like I didn't care for them, like ever, but this has hurt my mom way too much and at this point I just told her to forget it and focus on herself. This was before she left the country and before the diagnosis - after she was diagnosed with cancer she wanted to tell him about it and basically make up, after which the events I mentioned prior happened.

So yeah, this is more of less the full story, I felt like I needed to add all of this bc it adds some layers to this story and also bc I'm [REDACTED_NAME] anxious about mom's upcoming appointments. 

As for the two of them, as I mentioned in the comment I made - I understand that they're young and immature, but I still think that there are some boundaries even kids know not to cross. It's one thing to have your own ideas and goals and move to pursue them, and it's def not the same as disrespecting another human's life, much less your own mother's life. 

And to add bc I know some people like to comment - this is not me saying that all parents are the best bc they brought us into this world, like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not saying that especially bc of our father, however I do think that a woman who loves you so much and who went through so much to raise you should be respected.

I'll finish my story here, since I know that at this point I'm [REDACTED_NAME] rambling bc of my anxiety and bc I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on my meds for a few months now due to my depression and not seeing my doctors since like May (I know it's bad but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my energy on mom rn).",1,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My dad moved into an apartment down town. I remember the first time I was going to stay at my dad’s for the night. About an hour after being dropped off our neighbor from the house we lived in showed up, ended up making us dinner and stayed the night. Being very young at the time it never crossed my mind as being weird, she was a close neighbor we would hangout with her 2 kids all the time back at the house. Only a week went by and she had fully moved in with my dad, I recall them telling us “the apartment office messed up and put us in the same unit and because we know each other we are just going to accept it for now” again young self didn’t think anything of it, I guess those things happen….(?). 
YEARS went by and my dad and neighbor never admitted to dating or just didn’t mention it. About 11 years later they bought a house together, at this point I was old enough to know they were dating and eventually they did get married and had a kid together. 
It wasn’t until I was about 24 that I told this story to a friend and went “wait a minute…. Apartments don’t screw up like that….” And everything started to make sense. After asking my mom and step mom I found out both of them filed for divorced a week apart from the other. 
I think it’s wild that my entire life it never accured to me that that’s what happened. But now looking back at it I just laugh because of the excuse they tried to use about moving in together. 
Figures i’d share this story because it makes me laugh sometimes that I never noticed what happened ",861,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My parents were both young when they had me and worked hard to afford a small house.  We lived there until I was 10 (4th grade) and I went to a public school 5 mins away walking. 

When I was 11 and supposed to enter 5th grade, shit started to get weird. They sold the house and we rented a room where the 3 of us lived. My dad started working two jobs and my mom started working longer hours as a domestic worker. 
The new school they enrolled me in, was so different I had a hard time adjusting. It screamed money everywhere, they gave us all laptops and ipads stuff I’d never touched in my life. 

At home we were so fucking poor most of the time my only meal for the day would be rice with eggs, and whatever they gave me at school. 

I didn’t understand what was going on  and resented my parents for putting us through that shit so i could go to a ‘better school’. But as the years passed I adapted and started making friends. 

As kids you don’t truly care about who the parents of your friends are, so every time they invited me to vacation with everything paid I was just happy. My parents usually were invited but only my mom could go. 

Only now I realize that it was me that allowed my parents to get close to all that important people. My mom became a close friend of my best friend’s and slowly our situation became better. My dad got in another business with them and my mom also started her own thanks to all the contacts I made in school. My group friend consisted of maria ( daughter of the top producers of rice and noodles), ricardo (the son of the richest doctor in the country), and lucia (the daughter of the biggest car seller lmao). 

Now I’m studying abroad with all the commodities I could only dream of when I was a child. We suffered a lot, and were judged even more but in the end it all paid off. ",5543,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18ytins,1704416179,1/5/2024 0:56,stories,28 Days and Everyday I Remember All Over Again,"In August my then 14 month old son was sitting with his big brother when I looked at him and realized how lethargic he was. I thought back and realized he hadn't had a wet diaper since the previous night. Terrified that something might be wrong with his kidneys, I called my husband home from work and rushed my son to the Emergency Department. They said that his blood was too acidic and life flighted him to the nearest children's hospital. The hospital was able to give him the right things to fix his acid levels. But after 2 weeks and numerous tests, they informed us that our sweet boy had a mitochondrial disorder, so each cell in his body made about 5% of the energy it's supposed to. They said his form of the disease had never been seen before so they could not predict how his life and disease would progress.

We brought him home for 5 weeks, and he was fed through a stomach tube the whole time. My husband woke me up at 6am mid October in a panic. ""The baby is blue! I need you to wake up, he needs to go to the hospital."" I threw clothes on, got our son into his car seat and drove straight to the Emergency Department. I had a home oxygen monitor and his oxygen wouldn't go above 75%. We were terrified. Because we live in a rural area, driving him was much faster than an ambulance. They assessed him at the hospital. They said that he needed to go back to the children's hospital again. So I watched a second time as the helicopter flew away with my baby inside. 

The second day in the hospital he went into respiratory failure. They intubated him and put him on a ventilator. He was in the hospital for 2 months. Each time they took him off the ventilator, it was harder and harder for his body to breathe on its own. Even still, I expected him to get better. I thought they would discharge him and we'd bring him home and have years and years left with him. I thought that 5 pneumonias in a row (all contracted in the hospital) were just bumps in the road, that he would eventually get better. 

The first week of December they did an MRI. We got the news no parent should ever hear. Our son's brain stem was irreparably damaged by his illnesses and his underlying disease. The part of his brain that maintained respiratory capacity had died. There was nothing more they could do but make him comfortable. We were told he would be put on hospice at 18 months old. December 7th, the hospital staff drove my son and I home in an ambulance with him on the ventilator. They told us before we took the trip that it might be weeks before he actually passed. They told us there would be time.

When they brought him in the house on the ventilator, I sat on the couch with open arms, finally allowed to hold my boy again. They began removing his breathing tube right away. The second it was removed, I knew. He struggled to take a raspy breath and began to go blue. The nurse told me, ""He's going."" I put my hand to his chest and whispered to him what I whispered everyday he was in the ICU, ""You are my sun, and my moon, and my starlit sky. Without you, I dwell in darkness..."" His few little breaths were horrible, the sound still breaks me. They gave him oxygen but that was never going to be enough and we all knew it. I saw the light leave his eyes as I held him in my arms and he looked at me for his final heartbeats. And then he was just gone.

It's been 28 days and each day that I wake, I remember all over again. I am [REDACTED_NAME] by the echoes of my child's dying breaths. I open my eyes in bed knowing that there is no baby to feed, no baby to kiss and snuggle, nowhere to put all of this love and grief in a tangled mess, ever present inside my chest. Life goes on for everyone around me. And it still doesn't feel real. It's like being caught inside of a nightmare you can't wake up from. And so much of me wants to SCREAM from the rooftops, ""My child died! Doesn't anyone care?!""

xizsi0,1663650679,9/20/2022 5:11,offmychest,Childhood trauma,"I am [REDACTED_NAME] to put in a wall of text here, in the hopes that someone will read it and point me in the direction of some kind of help. Maybe you even have advice yourself, who knows? Maybe I will feel better just getting it out there. Just so you're warned in advance.


I'm a 30 year old guy, and I've been dealing with this trauma since my early teens. My parents got divorced when I was 12 and things were fine for about half a year. Then my mother decided to move back to the other end of the country, where she's from, and brought me and my two younger brothers with her. Of course I hated her for it and grieved for years. When I was crying after the move, she told me to suck it up and stop feeling sorry for myself. When I told her I didn't want to go, she made fun of me.


Eventually I got used to missing my father, grandparents and my old friends. I still saw them every other weekend when I visited my father, and I found new friends and actually was pretty good until I turned 15. I had some run-ins with my mother's deadbeat boyfriends, but nothing serious. 


At that point my father asked me if I wanted to come live with him, while visiting a weekend. I instinctively said yes, and immediately regretted it. I hadn't noticed how I'd gotten used to my old life. But I felt that I couldn't tell anyone for fear of hurting him. In the following months it dawned on me what I was giving up for a life that no longer existed: my family, friends and my old self. I had a constant stomach-ache. Immediately when the move was finished, I felt like I had killed a part of myself and that I deserved it for deserting my mother and my siblings and moving away from my friends. The two years I lived there, the ache never stopped and I hated myself every single day. The guilt soon brought on a depression and my personality changed completely. I no longer cared about school. I had previously been extremely studious and conscientious. I became vain and arrogant, showered by the gifts t my father and his wife spoiled me with. My sense of self was gone and in its place was sheer contempt and anger. 


Due to this change in personality I became very popular with teens my age, but I was hard to be around. At home, especially.


My father and his wife were constantly irritated with me, for forgetting their house-rules. Depression affects your memory. Where I'd been polite and happily done my chores at my mother's, I didn't have the energy to even pick up my carefully folded clothes and put them away in the closet. My father reacted by telling me that I was being disrespectful to his wife and on one occasion he asked me where the old me had gone. The boy he loved so much.


The time I spent with him while there was really the only positive about the move and I loved it. But he soon told me that his wife was jealous of the time we spent together, so I would have to try and include her. I realize now that we were having a power-struggle, me and her, but I don't remember any of the particulars.


We soon clashed when one night after dinner, she stood up and started delegating chores for me. I thought it was odd that it wasn't my father doing this, but I didn't mind. I really wanted to live up to their expectations. It was all fine, until she said she wanted me to ""sometimes ask if there is anything I can help with"". Now that would have been all fine if it weren't for our ongoing conflict. I immediately knew that this was her going back to that struggle, showing her power over me. Even though it seems innocuous enough in writing, I am [REDACTED_NAME] stupid. Even as a kid I was extremely perceptive and I know perfectly well that I was exactly on the money. This meant that I would never be done with chores and she always had a reason to be unhappy, if I hadn't asked enough. Being that I was destroyed inside I didn't have the power to stand up for myself and I crumbled. All I could do was cry. So I had a full-on hyperventilating panic-attack, while she stomped out of the kitchen. My father soon followed, swearing and yelling about ""those fucking spoiled kids"". We never talked about it since.


Seeing as how the situation was out of my control, I called my mom to ask for help. She told me she would call my father.


The next day he sat me down and yelled about how he wasn't a bad father. The dumb kid that I was, I carefully tried to suggest his wife (then girlfriend) moved back to her old apartment. It was then my father decided to tell me that if it weren't for her, he'd hung himself in the toolshed when we moved. I gave up at that point. Turned around back to my computer screen.


A couple of weeks later, I told him that I'd like to move back to my mother's. He just said ""ok"" and that was it. We never talked about it and I left all of my friends and my life once more to move back. I still feel so bad. The friends I had there were some of the best I've ever had and I just left them without trying to keep our friendships alive. I'd already experienced what it feels like for friendships to run out into the sand. It's excruciating.  


Back at my mother's I noticed how my siblings had grown without me being there. We no longer had the tight bonds we used to and I feel the regret to this day. I've tried to get closer to them for years, but it isn't happening. The same with my relationship with my mother. I used to be able to talk to her about things and hash out my feelings. We used to fight and we would make up afterwards. Since moving back and forth it's just been awkward. Every time I've tried to talk to her about something since it has felt unsatisfying. My friendship with my father is ruined as well. He used to be my best friend. 


I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the same person anymore. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the person I was before nor after the moving. I'm [REDACTED_NAME], unproductive, sad. I've had to fight tooth and nail, to just function and be a decent human being. I've flunked out of university twice. I've spent four years on well-fare. Eventually I got my degree, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I worry constantly. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] anti-depressants and I've been in contact with mental healthcare in my country since I was 15. I've never had the trust or opportunity to tell these things to anyone. I don't want to be told to man up and stop whining.


At 19 I got diagnosed with Schizotypal PD and I suspect that this is the reason that none of the several psychologists, nurses and psychiatrists have asked or been interested in my story. Unless I'm [REDACTED_NAME] anti-psychotic medication, they simply don't want to talk to me. The response when I've tried to bring up my past is: ""you think too much"", ""we might be able to talk about that some time"" and any other deflection. My current psychologist has been on sick leave since April and no psychologist in the private sector wants me as a patient because of my diagnosis.


Now I've been awake the whole night for the 10th time maybe this month and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of myself. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] broken.


My relationships with my parents and siblings are better, but we never talk about the past. I've tried talking to my parents of course, but I don't have the strength to force it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of what they'll say the next time I ask for help. Will it be: ""man up and stop feeling sorry for yourself"", or will it be ""I'll go hang myself in the toolshed"".


I don't want this to be a story about how I eventually killed myself, I don't have a choice but to try and deal with it somehow, because more than anything else, I don't want my story to be one about how I was broken as a teen and was never able to live anything but a life wasted. How do I talk to my parents?

1fuyyoa,1727927069,10/3/2024 3:44,stories,A Love Story for Reddit: Prologue and Chapter 1,"Prologue:
Do you enjoy reading any love story? I love my story. I’ve never been so self important to think that my story is better than anyone else’s. Ive learned that the unfortunate reality is that so many people do not get the luxury of experiencing lasting love. So what that leads me to do is tell my story. My hope is that if you’re reading this, maybe I can help you recognize it. 

Love is an experience. It’s one of few feelings that when you have felt it, you know its a good one. It’s only once you realize that you’re experiencing “love” that you have to make the decision: 
1. Do I pursue this? Do I try to recreate it and risk losing it?
2. Do I leave this be and assume that I’m romanticizing what it’s like to be loved?

I don’t have real numbers on this but I venture to guess that most of us choose option 2 99% of the time and I mean that. Opportunities to experience love are all around us. We desire romantic love above all most of the time. Well isn’t it the things we want most that we are most afraid of? Afraid of having, afraid of losing. If our experience in life has been that we do not get what we want, would we not take our opportunities for romantic love for granted most of all? We dream of getting a winning lottery ticket that takes all of our cares away, but if your perfect person was sitting across from you right now, would you be ready to meet them? Not just “would you be scared” but would you be ready to be what they needed while they tried to do the same for you or would you ask them to pull you forward while you changed into the person they need? Would you first have to go through the process of learning how to pursue them and ask them to wait for you while you do so? Pursuing what we want in life is our only option. If we don’t, or if we let up on our pursuit, our fears get the opportunity to catch up to us… and stab us right in the back. 

This is the story of how I fell in love with my wife, how lucky I was, and how my attraction and infatuation with her had nothing to do with where I am [REDACTED_NAME]. It will be entertaining and it’s adorable. Everyone loves hearing it and making me retell it to new audiences. Nonetheless, I would trade our story for a boring one if it meant that I could love her more today so I didn’t have to wait until tomorrow. 

Chapter 1: Stop Loving Me

I met her in the 4th grade. Don’t go counting your chickens before they hatch though. You cant guess how this story is going to go. For one, she and I have different accounts for how the 4th grade went. I remember having a quiet crush on her and being so involved in a small relationship with everyone in the room that I wasn’t really close with anyone but maybe one main best friend. Her account was that she and I were friends and part of a friend group and that I didn’t ever show any interest in her despite her crush on me. It doesn’t help my account that if you get her 4th grade yearbook (that she still has) out, you can find where I signed it with “Have a bad year.” “Bad” was crossed out and changed to “good” by her, clearly not in the same handwriting. 

In 3rd grade, I remember being new at that elementary school and didn’t know my future wife existed. Every boy in my class had a crush on the same girl, including me. She had a crush on one boy: me. Valentine’s Day rolled around and she brought me chocolates in a heart shaped box. It was sitting on my desk. She was wearing a Navy Blue matching jacket and pants and had gotten to school early to make sure to put those chocolates on my desk before I got there. When I saw them, I was surprised. I flipped them over to see who they were from. They were from the girl I wanted to want me. She did and now everyone knows it. I was the only one with chocolates on their desk. The secret is out now. So now there’s only one thing left to do: throw them in the trash in front of everyone. So I did. She immediately went to the teacher and got a hall pass. She left the room. Everyone was looking at me while I was looking out oblivious. The only thoughts in my mind were how I had just avoided telling a room full of people that I had a crush on a girl. One girl whispered to me, “You made her cry.” To my genuine surprise I responded back, “Was she? Why? Everyone likes her.”

Once I moved to the 4th grade I tried to convince myself that I would muster the courage to tell a girl I liked her if I ever knew she liked me. I had a crush on two girls in that class. One was the girl everyone seemed to have a crush on. She had a boyfriend (you know, because there was always one “it” couple despite us being 9 years old). So I made a deal with myself that if this girl ever expressed her feelings for me, I would do it right this time. The other girl was the one that was quiet and kept to herself. She was the one I wished silently to myself the teacher would ask to read aloud. She was the one I kept tabs on constantly despite her being intentionally under the radar. She was a straight A kid. You could tell that getting in trouble for talking in class mortified her. She was the golden child. She lit up when you gave her attention, but she always kept her distance when I was getting myself into trouble (which happened a lot in the 4th grade). She had the cutest face, large eyes, and a smile that beamed at you if you could ever get that shy face to spare one. 

It’s amazing the things you remember. Why is that? Well, love is an experience. We keep so many memories in our subconscious and are ready to tie them together with other things that happen in life in ways we previously hadn’t considered being able to. Maybe we remember a street name that later shows up on the news and suddenly we say “I’ve been there!” Love can solidify these same timelines in our mind and assist us in recalling the same info. We pay attention more when we are experiencing love. And of course we do, because that’s when it makes the most sense to. On the other hand, that doesn’t mean that we are unwilling to throw it away in favor of being able to step away from vulnerability. It doesn’t mean that we always recognize it. It certainly doesn’t mean that we never confuse it with something else. Love is still the constant, though. That’s why we must pursue it. That’s why it takes so much effort to hold onto. It’s not trying to get away, but its not normal to do everything it asks us to. Sometimes we let go of it because we don’t feel like we deserve it. We feel like it must have the wrong person. If love asks us to change into someone else, what if we don’t like that person? It’s funny, we are afraid to change into a person that better aligns with what we want, but we rarely flinch when allowing ourselves to become the embodiment of our fears. “What if I don’t like that me (the one I am [REDACTED_NAME] I love)?” Well, here’s a compromise: if you love you right now, don’t change. But if you aren’t satisfied with who you are, let the pursuit of love consume you before your fears convince you love can only heal you and that there is no life beyond it. 

I never mustered the courage to tell my future wife how I felt about her in the 4th grade, but 5th grade was my year. I for sure was going to tell a girl I liked her in the 5th grade. Ultimately I did (3 girls in fact). Unfortunately, the sweet quiet girl from the 4th grade wasn’t in my class this year. But, no biggie. I just needed to figure out which class she was in so I can see when I might run into her at school. I remember the phone list coming out the first week of school. When I got home I went through every class to find her teacher. She wasn’t there. She and I both had brothers that were friends in the same grade 2 years older. My brother and I weren’t very close and he was definitely not going to learn about the girl I had a crush on so I casually asked him if they had any classes together. He said, “no, their family moved.” My heart dropped, “Moved? Moved where? you never mentioned that.” He brushed it off, “ya, they moved 6 hours away. They’re gone.”

vel91r,1655486704,6/17/2022 17:25,offmychest,A story about my late Dad has affected me more than I thought it would (Long Post),"I just need someone to tell about this because I don't know how to feel. A little bit of background: I (23 F) lost my dad to bone cancer on February 2021. He was the most loving, caring, and considerate father I could have asked for. Watching him fight 7 months against this extremely painful cancer was very traumatizing for me. I am [REDACTED_NAME] oldest of two. My little brother is 15. I still have anxiety and have hypochondriac tendencies that I am [REDACTED_NAME] to therapy for. 

Okay, onto the story. The other day I went to visit my mom at her house. After a few glasses of wine, my dad came to conversation. While my dad was an amazing father, he was not the best husband. He was a functioning alcoholic, and because he was such a great dad, I didn't realize how bad it was until I was an adult. But my mom has forgiven him and helped me take care of him in his last months. 

I decided to ask her if she knew WHY my dad was like this all his life. He never wanted to amount to anything. He stayed at a dead end job that paid very little. He was an AMAZING singer, and when a producer family member tried to push him to audition for ""The voice"", my dad declined. All my life I grew up seeing how talented he was in singing and even baseball, but he never pursued his talents. And one thing I noticed too since I can remember...he HATED my grandma.

After asking my mom, told me the following:

When my dad was 16, he lived in an abusive home. My grandma and grandpa were toxic, and my dad being the oldest, would get the worst of it. So he often looked for ways to stay out of his house. Instead of joining a gang or finding the wrong crowd, my dad found baseball. He would play with local leagues who would not charge him for his uniform or the membership to be in the league because he was **SO FREAKING GOOD** at playing. They wanted him to be in the team, even if it meant for free since he had no money at the time. One day, there was news that talent scouts were coming to town in a few months to check out and find people to sign to the MLB. And the coaches in my dad's team told him he had a real shot. But he needed to train harder and take his body to its peak athleticism. This meant buying high quality foods, vitamins, and he had to actually sign up to the league with a paid membership to even be considered. This was all very expensive, and my dad had no support from his family to help him pay. So, my dad started to take the money my grandma was giving him to pay his school tuition and instead stopped going to school and would train for 8 hours a day. He used the money to buy the food, the multivitamins, and pay his membership with the league. Two months later, the scouts come to town, and they are floored my dad's talent. They offered him a Minor league contact and let him know that once he turned 18 he would be offered a Major League contact. This was it, this was my dad's way out. The hard work and dedication my dad put in for so long, pushed his body so hard, it was all for this moment. My dad had his life laid out in front of him, and it looked VERY promising. The only thing left was for one of his parents to sign the contract, since he was a minor, and then the start of his new life would begin. That day, my dad came home, and my grandma had JUST arrived home too, **from his school**. She found out that he had not paid the tuition for the last 2 months, and that my dad had been skipping school as well. My grandma was LIVID. My dad apologized and begged for her to listen. He explained that he did it for a reason, and that he now had accomplished this amazing thing. But my grandma was having non of it, and of course, refused to sign the contract. **My dad went to my grandpa for help, begged for his support, but my grandpa said no***.* Because he did not want to deal with my grandma's wrath. In the end, even the talent scouts came to his house to try to convince my grandma, to no avail. And just like that, my dad's dream was taken away. From that moment on, my dad became what he eventually became. He started drinking, partying, and god knows what else. Almost like a vendetta against my grandma, he made her life a living hell.

Why does this story affect me so much? Because this was the final piece of a puzzle I had with my dad. Thinking all my life that my dad just didn't have ambition..to finding out he had given up on himself because of this trauma. But I think what affects me the most is that...**this story repeated itself with me**. 

When I was 17 and graduated college, I wanted to leave my house and move to LA with my boyfriend who was 20. I wanted to go to college in LA and start a life away from my hometown. I was accepted at UCLA, my boyfriend was able to take me in, and his family even had a job lined up for me, so I could go to school and work. I planned everything to the T. But when I told my mom about it, she was NOT having it. She said I was crazy for wanting to do this, that is was sin, and that I was not old enough to move out. And I was devastated. Because I was a minor, she was not going to allow me to go. Then my dad stepped in. From the get go he said yes. He liked my boyfriend and trusted my instincts. He even offer to do the [REDACTED_ADDRESS] to LA with all my stuff so I could move in. In that moment I didn't understand just how important this situation was for my dad. In his story, his own dad didn't support him. In my story, he was the dad, and he chose to do what his dad didn't do in that moment. In the end, my mom accepted the situation. I moved in with my boyfriend and I made a good life of myself in LA. When my dad was diagnosed with cancer, I moved back to my hometown to take care of him, and my boyfriend moved as well. He helped me take care of my dad and gave me the moral support I needed in such a horrible situation. My now fiancé and I are a power couple, we have moved back to this town and have made it work. We have a home, are planning a wedding, and are going to start a family in a few years. All thanks to that small decision my father made to let me do what I felt I needed for me. I feel sad for my dad's story, and also very thankful for his unconditional support and love he had for me.",1,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b3ylfj,1553216191,3/22/2019 0:56,confession,I framed my mother's ex husband when I was 5,"So, for a little background, my moms ex husband was a jerk. Later on in life, I found out that he was even worse than I thought, but even to 5 year old me, he was a jerk. For example, there was one summer that he spent all of our money (meaning his and the money from the THREE jobs my mom worked at the time) on cigarettes and booze and other dumb shit, leading to me and my sister having to spend the summer at my grandmother's because there was literally no food in the house and my mom had to live off of bread and butter for about 3 months. He was that kind of guy. 

So, when I was a kid, I always got up much much earlier than everyone else. I can't remember why, but it was probably just so I could watch cartoons in peace. One morning, I went into the living room to find this dudes pocket knife on the couch. It was closed, but i got curious. 

I opened it and I was playing with it, when I had a thought. Obviously I can't remember the actual train of thought, but it led to me deciding to cut my hand, right in the center of my palm, so that mom would be mad at Meat-Head-Mcdonald. I immediately started bleeding, and a lot. (Now, I know that I bled so much bc I have a blood clotting disorder, yay me) I started screaming, mom came down the stairs along with Dick-Wipe, and they saw what happened. 

I told mom that he had left the knife open on the couch arm, and I had put my hand down on it on accident. This led to one of their biggest fights, with mom saying that he was endangering me, and Micro-Penis saying he swore he didn't leave it open. 

So yeah. I still have the lovely scar on the middle of my hand to remind me that I was more of an evil genius when I was a child than I ever will be again. Fun.

1h33ffu,1732937112,11/30/2024 3:25,self,I’m a millionaire and it cost me everything,"37M. Recently hit this milestone after committing myself to my career for the last 15 years. I thought just focus on you, build the future you’re envisioning and the rest will fall into place. Man was I wrong.  The only thing I have is my career. I’ve completely lost myself along the way.

I’m sitting alone in my apartment as the holiday weekend gets under way. Watching the city come to life as I feel I slowly succumb to the opposite force. My friends are all with their families and loved ones, most have small children of their own. Everyone is rightfully consumed with their family and close friends - I just don’t fit-in in most of those settings anymore. 

I could absolutely go out on my own, so I’m not throwing a pity party, it just doesn’t sound appealing to me. 

I’ve given up my hobbies as I never had time for them the last decade, or they no longer interest me. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to find love - some blame is certainly my own in this category but still feels like it’s been a gauntlet. And now most of the available women my age have baggage, kids, etc. Not exactly exciting. 

My friends who I grew up with look at me differently now that I’m successful. There is resentment. I went to intense graduate school and post-grad training during my twenties and  early thirties, I grew apart from and lost touch with many good friends.

I used to be incredibly extroverted and could talk to a wall. Now, not only does small talk and interacting with people seem pointless, I’ve realized I can barely keep a conversation anymore. Interaction with people is a task now, and usually a disappointing or at best unremarkable occurrence in my day. 

I’m a shell of my former self. I don’t have anything to offer anyone other than money. And that’s a worse feeling than having no money, which I’ve also experienced. 

In my tireless journey for success, I lost my humanity and there is no worse poverty to experience than that of connection. 

I hope this finds you well, and I implore you to nurture your connections. Love your family and spouse. Be present with the ones that matter. Lean into your friendships. There is no higher calling as a human than to brighten the world of those you love. That’s real wealth. 

In a world that’s obsessed with status and appearance, achievement and comparison, chasing these vague axioms will lead to a life of emptiness and regret. Be thankful for what you have and for those you love.  It’s the only currency that matters. 



Edit: the intent behind writing this was a cautionary tale to the young professionals and young adults, caution that trying to fulfill yourself and find meaning in life through accomplishment and finances alone will not suffice. To cherish the friends and family you’ve got if you’re lucky enough to have them. Many young people driven to achieve are running from something in their past, I was. it isn’t a valid coping mechanism, and I’m humbly realizing that now. 

I also want to recognize the spectrum on which suffering occurs. I assure you I am [REDACTED_NAME] of how my situation doesn’t hold a candle to most of human suffering. I’m not looking for pity and I appreciate the interaction with this post, even the negative comments have value to me. Be well, all.

370f4g,1432405613,5/23/2015 18:26,confession,I am an idiot and I know it,"[Remorse]

I belong to India, and this is my story, my confession.
I was always a bright student and though not so good in sports, was still charming thanks to my 6 ft frame and lean physique.
When I was 15, I fell in love with a girl(same age). We dated for almost 2 years, when she realized it was just infatuation and decided to move on. 
It was my first relationship, and I was madly in love with her. I begged, pleaded, cried, requested her to stay back in my life, but she never did come back. I screwed up that year of my school.
Eventually I fought off my feelings for her and got admission into one of the topmost colleges of India.
Somewhere, somehow she was always in some corner of my heart, but I totally lost contact with her for a few years.
During this time, I met a girl who was kind of a mirror image of mine. We hit it like crazy, fell in love and got married.
My life has been pretty smooth and successful as well. I also do some professional cooking and blogging, and in India, its a big deal to do some solid work apart from your regular job.
I am [REDACTED_NAME] in my 30s, have a 1 year old kid, and my wife and we love each other a lot.
I know my life with my wife has been great to awesome till now, but somehow, unsaid, unmentioned, unspecified to anyone in this world, there is a feeling, had it been her, it would have been legendary.

Anyways, the girl is in another country, and she adds me on FB. The first thing she mentions to me is ""our silly affair"" and we talk and shrug it off. 

Few days ago, I had to visit my school where we had initially met. As soon as the nostalgia hit me, I cried. Then I went to the spot where she proposed me, and we spent some of our time, and I cried out more. It was like, time hadnt passed at all and I was that 15 yr old idiot kid again. I did some retrospection, and felt its not because I missed her, its because of the pain that she made me go through

Now, since the time I have been to visit my school, I felt really frustrated, incomplete and lonesome. I try to keep the same old mask up, but deep down I am [REDACTED_NAME] daily and feeling like a loser. What could I have done to make her stay? I was just a 15 yr old kid, and damn! 15 years have passed and I have a family now. But, the thoughts just wont go away.

Because of my extra curricular work, my social standing is on a high, and that girl, in fact tried to get some ideas on professional blogging and all.

I feel like an idiot because I know neither can anything happen r now, nor does it make any kind of sense. Just that whenever I see her activity on FB, or try to remember those days or even call/visit my school friends, I get chills for the really painful time that I went through. I was almost suicidal at one point back then.

I dont know how to get out of this situation. Unfriend her? Block her? Would that serve the purpose? Am I not doing injustice to my wife who loves me a lot? I dont know. I just know I am [REDACTED_NAME] idiot to be in such a situation

I just know there is only one way out of this situation, and that is to shrug the memories off again with all my efforts. But, its getting difficult each passing day. 

EDIT: First of all a huge thanks to all of you for taking out time and read my confession and coming up with some beautiful ideas. Of course, the suggestions vary a lot because the entire situation cannot be completely explained in one reddit confession. I was simply amazed by a couple of suggestion because I had in my mind that whatever you guys will suggest, I would already know it(like Unfriending), but a few suggestions really helped me explain the situation I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I would be replying to all the comments/suggestions, but wanted to say thanks here

Yesterday was talking to a common friend, who told me, that girl got divorced and remarried a few months ago

1gouvit,1731339078,11/11/2024 15:31,self,You're being targeted by disinformation networks that are vastly more effective than you realize. And they're making you more hateful and depressed.,"(I wrote this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1bfto4a/youre_being_targeted_by_disinformation_networks/)in March and posted it on r/GenZ.  However, a few people messaged me to say that the r/GenZ moderators took it down last week, though I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure why.  Given the flood of divisive, gender-war posts we've seen in the past five days, and several countries' [demonstrated ](https://www.queensu.ca/artsci/news/how-russian-gender-based-disinformation-could-influence-the-2024-u-s-presidential-election)use of gender-war propaganda to fuel political division in multiple countries, I felt it was important to repost this.  This post was written for a U.S. audience, but the implications are increasingly global.)

**TL;DR:** You know that Russia and other governments try to manipulate people online.  But you almost certainly don't how just how effectively orchestrated influence networks are using social media platforms to make you -- individually-- angry, depressed, and hateful toward each other. Those networks' goal is simple: to cause Americans and other Westerners -- especially young ones -- to give up on social cohesion and to give up on learning the truth, so that Western countries lack the will to stand up to authoritarians and extremists.

And you probably don't realize how well it's working on you.

This is a long post, but I wrote it because this problem is real, and it's much scarier than you think.

**How Russian networks fuel racial and gender wars to make Americans fight one another**

In September 2018, [a video went viral](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.[REDACTED_PHONE]/viral-video-of-feminist-pouring-bleach-on-manspreaders-debunked-as-russian-propaganda-1.[REDACTED_PHONE]) after being posted by In the Now, a social media news channel. It featured a feminist activist pouring bleach on a male subway passenger for manspreading. It got instant attention, with millions of views and wide social media outrage. Reddit users wrote that it had turned them against feminism.

There was one problem: [The video was staged.](https://euvsdisinfo.e[REDACTED_USER]/) And In the Now, which publicized it, is a subsidiary of RT, formerly Russia Today, the Kremlin TV channel aimed at foreign, English-speaking audiences.

As an MIT study found in 2019, **Russia's online influence networks** [reached 140 million Americans](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) **every month** \-- the majority of U.S. social media users. 

***Russia began using troll farms a decade ago to incite gender and racial divisions in the United States*** 

In 2013, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a confidante of Vladimir Putin, founded the Internet Research Agency (the IRA) in St. Petersburg. It was the Russian government's first coordinated facility to disrupt U.S. society and politics through social media.

Here's what Prigozhin [had to say](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html) about the IRA's efforts to disrupt the 2022 election:

>Gentlemen, we interfered, we interfere and we will interfere. Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how. During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once.

In 2014, the IRA and other Russian networks began [establishing fake U.S. activist groups on social media](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html). By 2015, [hundreds](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-whistle-blowing-troll-gets-her-day-in-court/[REDACTED_PHONE]8.html) of English-speaking young Russians worked at the IRA.  Their assignment was to use those false social-media accounts, especially on Facebook and Twitter -- [but also on Reddit, Tumblr, 9gag](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-[REDACTED_PHONE]5), and other platforms -- **to aggressively spread conspiracy theories and mocking, ad hominem arguments** **that incite American users.**

In 2017, U.S. intelligence found that **Blacktivist**, a Facebook and Twitter group with more followers than the official Black Lives Matter movement, [was operated by Russia](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html). Blacktivist regularly attacked America as racist and urged black users to rejected major candidates. On November 2, 2016, just before the 2016 election, Blacktivist's Twitter [urged](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html) Black Americans: ""Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it's not a wasted vote.""

***Russia plays both sides -- on gender, race, and religion***

The brilliance of the Russian influence campaign is that it convinces Americans to attack each other, worsening both misandry and misogyny, mutual racial hatred, and extreme antisemitism and Islamophobia. In short, it's not just an effort to boost the right wing; it's an effort to radicalize everybody.

Russia uses its trolling networks to **aggressively attack men.**  According to [MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/), in 2019, the most popular Black-oriented Facebook page was the charmingly named ""**My Baby Daddy Aint Shit.""**  It regularly posts memes attacking Black men and government welfare workers.  It serves two purposes:  Make poor black women hate men, and goad black men into flame wars.  

MIT found that My Baby Daddy is [run by a large troll network](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) in Eastern Europe likely financed by Russia.

But Russian influence networks are also also aggressively misogynistic and aggressively anti-LGBT.  

On January 23, 2017, just after the first Women's March, the New York Times found that the Internet Research Agency began [a coordinated attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) on the movement.  Per the Times:

>More than 4,000 miles away, organizations linked to the Russian government had assigned teams to the Women’s March. At desks in bland offices in St. Petersburg, using models derived from advertising and public relations, copywriters were testing out social media messages critical of the Women’s March movement, adopting the personas of fictional Americans.

>**They posted as Black women critical of white feminism, conservative women who felt excluded, and men who mocked participants as hairy-legged whiners.**

But the Russian PR teams realized that one attack worked better than the rest:  They accused its co-founder, Arab American Linda Sarsour, of being an antisemite.  Over the next 18 months, at least 152 Russian accounts regularly attacked Sarsour.  That may not seem like many accounts, but it worked:  They drove the Women's March movement into disarray and eventually crippled the organization. 

**Russia doesn't need a million accounts**, or even that many likes or upvotes.  It just needs to get enough attention that actual Western users begin amplifying its content.   

A former federal prosecutor who investigated the Russian disinformation effort [summarized it like this](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html):

>**It wasn’t exclusively about Trump and Clinton anymore.  It was deeper and more sinister and more diffuse in its focus on exploiting divisions within society on any number of different levels.**

As the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) in 2022, 

>There was a routine: Arriving for a shift, **\[Russian disinformation\] workers would scan news outlets on the ideological fringes, far left and far right, mining for extreme content that they could publish and amplify on the platforms, feeding extreme views into mainstream conversations.**

**China is joining in with AI**

Last month, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/media/chinese-influence-campaign-division-elections.html) on a new disinformation campaign.  **""Spamouflage""** is an effort by China to divide Americans by combining AI with real images of the United States to exacerbate political and social tensions in the U.S.  The goal appears to be to cause Americans to lose hope, by promoting exaggerated stories with fabricated photos about homeless violence and the risk of civil war.

As Ladislav Bittman, a former Czechoslovakian secret police operative, [explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) about Soviet disinformation, **the strategy is not to invent something totally fake.  Rather, it is to act like an evil doctor who expertly diagnoses the patient’s vulnerabilities and exploits them, “prolongs his illness and speeds him to an early grave instead of curing him.”**

**The influence networks are vastly more effective than platforms admit**

Russia now runs its most sophisticated online influence efforts through a network called **Fabrika**.  Fabrika's operators [have bragged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/16/russia-disinformation-discord-leaked-documents/) that social media platforms catch **only 1%** of their fake accounts across YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram, and other platforms.

But how effective are these efforts?  By 2020, Facebook's [most popular pages](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) for Christian and Black American content were run by Eastern European troll farms tied to the Kremlin. And Russia doesn't just target angry Boomers on Facebook. Russian trolls are enormously active on Twitter. And, even, [on Reddit](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-used-reddit-and-tumblr-to-troll-the-2016-election).

**It's not just false facts**

The term ""disinformation"" undersells the problem.  Because much of Russia's social media activity is not trying to spread fake news.  Instead, **the goal is to divide and conquer** by making Western audiences depressed and extreme. 

Sometimes, through brigading and trolling.  Other times, by posting hyper-negative or extremist posts or opinions about the U.S. the West over and over, until readers assume that's how most people feel.  And sometimes, by using trolls to disrupt threads that advance Western unity.  

As the RAND think tank [explained](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html), **the Russian strategy is volume and repetition, from numerous accounts,** to overwhelm real social media users and create the appearance that everyone disagrees with, or even hates, them.  And it's not just low-quality bots.  Per RAND,

>Russian propaganda is produced in incredibly large volumes and is broadcast or otherwise distributed via a large number of channels. ... **According to a former paid Russian Internet troll, the trolls are on duty 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, and each has a daily quota of 135 posted comments of at least 200 characters.**

**What this means for you**

You are being targeted by a sophisticated PR campaign meant to make you more resentful, bitter, and depressed.  It's not just disinformation; it's also real-life human writers and advanced bot networks working hard to shift the conversation to the most negative and divisive topics and opinions. 

It's why some topics seem to go from non-issues to constant controversy and discussion, with no clear reason, across social media platforms.  And a lot of those trolls are actual, ""professional"" writers whose job is to sound real. 

**So what can you do?**  To quote *WarGames*:  The only winning move is not to play.  The reality is that **you cannot distinguish disinformation accounts from real social media users.**  Unless you know whom you're talking to, there is a genuine chance that the post, tweet, or comment you are reading is an attempt to manipulate you -- politically or emotionally.

Here are some thoughts:

* **Don't accept facts from social media accounts you don't know.**  Russian, Chinese, and other manipulation efforts are not uniform.  Some will make deranged claims, but others will tell half-truths.  Or they'll spin facts about a complicated subject, be it the war in Ukraine or loneliness in young men, to give you a warped view of reality and spread division in the West.  
* **Resist groupthink.**  A key element of manipulate networks is [volume](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/).  People are naturally inclined to believe statements that have broad support.  When a post gets 5,000 upvotes, it's easy to think the crowd is right.  But ""the crowd"" could be fake accounts, and even if they're not, the brilliance of government manipulation campaigns is that they say things people are already predisposed to think.  They'll tell conservative audiences something misleading about a Democrat, or make up a lie about Republicans that catches fire on a liberal server or subreddit.
* **Don't let social media warp your view of society.**  This is harder than it seems, but you need to accept that the facts -- and the *opinions* \-- you see across social media are not reliable.  If you want the news, do what everyone online says not to: look at serious, mainstream media.  It is not always right.  Sometimes, it screws up.  But social media narratives are heavily manipulated by networks whose *job* is to ensure you are deceived, angry, and divided.",33655,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1b6n7pc,1709588850,3/4/2024 21:47,TrueOffMyChest,Update-I’ve only just realized that I let the men I call my family and friends ruin my marriage,"
On Sunday I got to meet up with my ex-wife. I apologized profusely and she was kind and understanding but said she couldn’t and wouldn’t forgive me. She said that it simply isn’t in her nature to forgive, and that despite it all she holds no grudges or anger against me and wishes me nothing but goodness in my life.

She did give me some advice and told me that I have been in an abusive relationship all my life and that in order to heal whatever is broken in me that I should cut out my father as he sets the tone for my treatment by the rest of my family(she had pointed out the many ways my father has hurt me or had encouraged my family to mistreat me). She said I’d always be stagnated and unhappy if I continued to associate myself with my family and former friends. I told her that I cut them out of my life and that I’ve got my first therapy session scheduled in a few days. She said she was proud of me for taking my first step into healing. 

Our conversation was heartfelt and emotionally devastating as we discussed the many ways our marriage had failed as well as the abuse I’ve experienced by my father and family. We cried the entire time. We cried a lot. We ended our conversation with a long hug and then we said our goodbyes.",4597,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
y0izqu,1665418992,10/10/2022 16:23,offmychest,"I don't know if I'm too sensitive, or if it's the environment I'm in","I'll start by telling y'all what I went through in school and at home and then stuff that later on happened from then to most recent and how I feel

Sorry if my grammar isn't good or if I make some spelling mistakes.

I, 17 female, have been dealing with some problems  throughout almost all my life. 

When I was 9 years old I was suicidal. The reasons why I thought I was, was because I got bullied a lot. Years later I realized I was not only that, but it was also my family.

When I was in elementary, my mom had to work at the hospital. She was a respiratory therapist. She would always come home late at night and go straight to bed. So she didn't know what was going on at the house. It worried me as a kid because she didn't eat anything, just went straight to bed.

My uncle worked at a company, all I know about his job is that he can sometimes fix computers.
 He was always angry when my sister(18rn) and I would do the smallest things. If there was 1 piece of paper on the floor, if we accidently break something,  even if we write one letter in cursive and not the whole thing, he'll go on a rant about what we did and then change the subject about something else involving something ""bad"" we do. He was always this way when we were young to the point there was I time I thought he was joking but it turned it out he wasn't and I got a mouthful. He was so scary to us to the point we would cry when he yelled at us.

My sister, back then, never really stood up for me it felt like she never liked me and always had a problem with me. And at the time I thought she hated me. She was like this from 3rd grade to 7th grade

When I was at school ( elementary), most of the boys were perverts or straight up assholes. When we ( my sis and I) were in I believe 1st- 3rd grade, some of the boys would look up girls skirts and say ""I can see your underwear"" just to embarrass them. The assholes of the boys would sometimes just straight up bully people. Most of the kids were nothing but scary in elementary.

I would cut myself with plastic utensils when I was in the playground, I don't know why but at that time I was upset at myself. 2 of my friends( both female) caught me doing this, one pinned me to the ground, the other got our coach. I went to the office and had to talk to the counselor about what was going on

The counselor informed my mother that I should go to a mental hospital and come back when I feel better.

When I was back from the mental hospital I was still suicidal because the nurses didn't do shit 

Later on there were rumors about me being ""Possessed"".

 I think how it happened was because I talked to my friends about how it was at the hospital and I mentioned how one of the nurses acted like I was possessed. 
My only guess was that someone heard our conversation and thought ""hurting yourself isn't normal they Must be possessed"".

Because of that I got bullied a lot in elementary.

I then got bullied for my weight in middle school.

I became homeschooled because of the drugs at middle school and how the teachers covered it up unless you were the parent of one of the kids hiding the drugs. 

My mental health got better and I had lost a lot of weight ever since I left public school. I also got along well with my sister to the point we played games together and we bonded really well.

 My uncle wasn't an asshole when I was around 14. He in fact never remembered him being mad at the little things. Turns out it was the medication he was taking that made him angry and when he is off the medication he will forget the stuff he said when he was on the medication.

My mom quit her job at being a respiratory therapist  and became a crossing guard. She has bonded a lot more with us this way. And we communicate a lot better.

My mental health got worse when my grandpa moved in. (I was 15)

He is, in short, a drunk. He was a bad liar, he would fall down a lot and on some occasions he would be bleeding too. He also had seizures because of his drinking.

I used to help him out but now my family, mostly my sister, won't let me and for good reason.

When I did helped him out there would mostly be blood on my hands. I would wash my hands even if there wasn't. I would also have flashbacks of blood on my hands when picking up or helping people stand too.

There were times me and my sister had to clean up after him. When we cleaned his room there would be a lot of vodka bottles and his room stills smells like urine.

One time I had to take a bucket full of piss and throw it In a dumpster. And there was another time I also had throw away trash that had puke.

Needless to say I wasn't doing so well after that. I felt like I needed to take 4 showers because of that shit. 

And the worse of it all.

My uncle and mom wants me to play nice.

PLAY NICE!?

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a psychiatrist but I know damn sure that I am [REDACTED_NAME] because of him.

And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] living through this stuff. Ever since my grandpa moved in and stuff like this has happened I feel a lot more sensitive.

If someone yells at me I cry.

If I forget to do something and upset someone because of it I cry.

I haven't cut myself for at least 4 years and now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that urge. I don't know what to do.

I feel like it might be the environment I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that is making me sensitive and making me cry a lot.

I want to talk to a therapist but I don't have a job or the money.

And although it makes me mad that my mom wants me to play nice, she's only doing that because she doesn't want any drama starting. She had always protected me throughout all of this. She didn't even know about the piss bucket and throw up I had to throw away. She was furious when she found out about that and would take us out to get out of the house. She would also do this if something similar happened.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] cps will be involved and I don't want that.

What do I do? Am I too sensitive? Or is it the environment?

17q6ps9,1699396766,11/7/2023 22:39,stories,My boyfriend of 10 years is insecure about not having a boy and I just found out why.,"So my boyfriend and I are high school sweethearts, and have been together since freshman year of high school, we met when I was 15 and he was 16, we hit it off massively and pretty early on in the school year, and have stayed solid ever since. He has a strange relationship with his parents, he had a pretty strong and deep connection with his mother, that I have witnessed multiple times and I tease him sometimes about being a mamas boy, but he didn’t interact with his father much. After we both graduated high school he decided to move in with me in my 2 bedroom apartment, we shared a room and used the other room as a game room where he would play his video games. So about 11 months ago my girl friend had a baby that I would help babysit when she had to work. So while babysitting that little bundle of joy I fell in love hard with that baby, and gained a massive baby fever, and I would constantly ask my boyfriend for him to give me a baby, until 6 months ago when he finally gave in and we started trying for a baby. Then after a few weeks of trying I was finally positive, and overjoyed to say the least. I remember crying for hours from excitement while on FaceTime with my girl friend. So one day my girl friend instructed us to go ultrasound done to see the baby’s gender. I wanted a girl, but my boyfriend seemed pretty confident that we were going to have a boy. After the results came the doctor said we were having not one but two girls. I was obviously excited, but my boyfriend seemed upset, not like on the verge of tears, or raging upset but he seemed disappointed. I tried to ask him what was wrong, but he gave me the usual “Oh nothing babe I’m fine.” That was the same response he always gave me when he was upset or disappointed at something. Fast forward to present day, and I was discussing with my boyfriend on how are we going to tell our parents about the pregnancy. We talked about how he finds my dad “scary as hell”, and how he would be to scared to tell him. I told him that my dad maybe intimidating, but he’s a sorta kind person, and how he likes my boyfriend. Then the conversation shifted to him talking about how “my dad would be disappointed in him for not having a son”. Then I just reassured him that my dad wouldn’t  think that about him and that he has the wrong idea of him. Then I asked him if he was ok, or if he had something to tell me. Then he said No and that I was reading into it too much, and that it doesn’t mean he’s any less of a man because we didn’t have a boy. Which confused me, because I said nothing about him being any less of a man due to the fact we’re not having a boy, but he insisted on saying my father would be angry with him about not having a boy. He started worrying me so I asked him if had a social anxiety problem or something to make him think this way. He nervously said “No I’m just scared of what people think me.” Then I told him that what he just said literally describes society anxiety, but while I said that I noticed he started tearing up. So I asked him what’s wrong and is everything okay, (btw this is also this is the first time I’ve ever seen him cry in the 10 years we’ve been together) after I asked him if he was ok, he started talking about how he wasn’t good enough for me, and how he wasn’t man enough for crying, and for not having a boy and how everyone was going to hate him for not being a true man. I tried to calm him down so we could talk this through, but he started crying harder and harder, as he started rambling about how his father wouldn’t accept him for being weak and not a true man, then he began to explain to me that his father would abuse him, and put this ideology in his head that true men only have boys true men don’t cry, and how my boyfriend would strive and try his hardest to get his father approval, but his father was never proud of anything he did. (To be honest is was kinda hard to understand most of what my boyfriend was saying as he cried but I think that’s the gist of it)
While my boy was venting to me about his trauma he cried so hard his nose started bleeding and he passed out in my arms. What my boyfriend told kept me up so it pretty late when I’m writing this and I don’t know what to do.",3282,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For some god awful reason he occasionally makes decisions that he wouldn’t normally do and his behavior does a 180z 

I was sick one day and felt super shitty. I couldn’t find anything to eat that would fill me up properly. It was terrible trying to scrounge up enough to eat before needing to rest. 

I remembered my brother was available to get me food and something from the pharmacy. No brainer.
He seemed very bothered and irritated when I asked, even knowing I was sick. He all but told me to fuck off. I couldn’t believe that this shit still happens. The person that never hesitated to pay full meals for me on a daily basis. Why the 180 treatment now?

I told him when he’s sick I’m gonna throw the exact same shit back at him. The anger whipped out the “save” option and burned it into my soul to bring up later.

Since then he’d been his great caring self. Lent money to him, which he’s payed back, listened to him through his breakup. Worked together well to solve my issues. Today he was sick and asked me to get him food while making it obvious he’s forgotten about what he did to me.

I calmly told him if he remembered what I told him last time. Nope?
I slowwwly and condescendingly told him that I definitely had not forgotten. That I needed him and he cruelly refused to be there for me while having a rude ass attitude.

“Oh” and he leaves. He’s currently on an empty stomach and he can fuck off for today. Being sick that day really sucked.

Edit: This surprisingly got more attention.
People are really black and white critical here.
You’ll come to lose people and in some cases even witness friends losing siblings. Ones that only wished they’d remained in contact but chose not to speak to each other. Others wake up crying because they had dreams of their sibling but couldn’t recall how it felt to touch them. You get your only sibling/s and that’s it for the rest of time and space.

 I was born in China and lived there for 7 years until I moved to America. Around when I was 6 or 7 I was invited to my friend’s house for a play date. There I was molested by 2 teenagers male and female (I never found out who they are). That memory felt like a fever dream but I still clearly remember where they laid their hands on me. As kid I never felt like I’m traumatized by it but I did developed anxiety and fear later on in life when talking the opposite sex.  But I do know from the start that something was wrong. Is was later in life that I realized that I was molest and raped. Ever since that I felt shamed of myself; I grew up in a strict Asian family so I never expressed my emotions to anyone. as I got into my high school years one of the teachers did notice my depression and anxiety after I tried so hard to hide it. The school pretty much force my parents to take me therapy once a week. During that time I lied about everything I blamed it on my lack of self esteem and bullshit my way throughout the session because I’m too embarrassed and shamed to tell my story. I had pretend like I’m getting better every week and put on a smile everyday just to get out of the impression I’m getting better and happy again. I don’t know what I might do to myself and I’m scared I thought about ending it all this week and I snap my way out of it when I was thinking about the consequence and how it could be devastating to my family.

125smc9,1680106326,3/29/2023 16:12,offmychest,Lost Girl,"Today 2023 I am 4 years into my recovery. I spent a lot of time covering and burying these feelings of neglect, hurt, loneliness, and hate for myself. I was addicted to crack/cocaine, I did cocaine before crack and almost hated it, it gave me the worst sinus infection and I eventually switched to meth. I was that kind of addict that could have died from the lifestyle alone. I traded my morals, self respect and care for anything I ever loved for one more hit. I failed rehab 3 times and did a little time in county. I was the only girl in county jail with the charge ""prostitution."" I look back now and I realize that the rehab time and all that bull shit was not for me to get better, if we are being honest if I recall one of the only reasons I went was to get out of the cold or because I had nowhere else to go. I wanted to get better but I knew deep down that I wasn't done with drugs, I admit everytime I walked into those doors of treatment my heart was not 100% on stopping drugs. I did try a few times to figure out why I turned to drugs and what was my deep core issue that I was covering up. This story explains finally why I am [REDACTED_NAME] way I am. Why I slept with over 20 guys by the time I was 15, including a married man. Now you can say what you want about me but I believe I was looking for love and affection. My innocence was taken from me at a very very young age and the influence I grew up around was not ideal for a kid. My mom and dad were young when they had me and now I know they got married because mom got pregnant, I think she was 19. My dad drank ALOT and he could get mentally, emotionally and physically abusive, if he got enough in him or drank whiskey.  Dad has a big heart and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only daughter, he is kind, generous, and a good dad. 

I took a lot of time in rehab to try to uncover my issues and try to heal but I got scared and ran every time. This time was different. In 2019 I was left by a guy I depended on, we were both homeless and my stuff was in his truck. One night he decided he wasn't gonna pick me up after work and it left me no choice but to do whatever I could to survive these streets. I needed to put my ducks in a row. By the time I realized he wasn't coming it was 10pm, I needed to find a bed, food, shower maybe, and more drugs to barter with. I ran the streets for almost 2 weeks alone with no help or someone to lean on. When I met Mel, I was looking rough, I had bruises all up and down my arms and legs, I was 90lbs, I haven't eaten in a day or two, and the best part I had the clothes on my back and maybe one more outfit in my bag. I had no underwear, one bra, like no socks, it was truly ridiculous. I lost everything I ever loved and owned 2ce over. I was Finally tired, finally just done. 

I met Mel in April of 2019, he was appalled when he realized how much I had lost and I still don't know what his true intentions were, maybe it was to help me or maybe it was to get in my pants, whatever it was I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it happened. I got clean with Mels love and support, no rehab, no NA or AA, I was done and I knew I had to stop or I was gonna die. 

These past 4 years I left state with Mel, we traveled for a bit and in this time I got to really think about what happened to me and why. It took some time for me to trust Mel and not think he was gonna leave in another state or somewhere stranded, he never did. I had nightmares, flashbacks, and bursts of anger for the first year. I really had to push through but I decided to write this story to maybe help someone that went through something similar. 

I was in a relationship with a 31 yr old when I was 12-13 years old.

A little back story: When I was growing up my dad was a carefree kind and just a free spirit. He was a functional alcoholic, he would get off work and drink anywhere from a half gallon to a whole gallon of vodka a night and get up at 6am and go to work. My mom and dad got divorced when I was young so I was passed back and forth but my dads was my favorite. I was allowed to do whatever I wanted and as a teenager I took advantage of that. Dad had a lot of friends and they drank too. Dad was close to his brother and he had a few real close friends who were around everyday of my childhood for as long as I can remember. The one in particular I will never forget. I was young, I mean like maybe 7-8 when (let's call him Jim) I met Jim. He was young, good looking and had been friends with dad from work. Jim and another one of dads friends lived together so they all started hanging out at my house. I had a friend over and she was a little older that day when Jim first came to my house. She was curious about him and I don't remember much about that day but I do recall Jim laying his head on her lap while she played with his hair. She gave him those flirty eyes and they sat there and talked. Remind you even though Jim was in his late 20s and my friend was maybe 12-13 at the time. Not long after I met Jim he got into some trouble and was sent to prison for a few years.

Fast Forward>>>>>

I was 11 when I found a letter from Jim to my dad. I wasn't sure if I was even allowed to read it but I opened it up and read it anyway. I will never forget the letters that formed the word ""tell wild child I said hi."" I don't know why I got curious, I actually don't even know what I was thinking. I spent days thinking of the letter, I guess I was lonely, I had to have felt some type of emptiness to write him back. I was 11 writing a grown ass man in prison for pulling out a gun on some guys who robbed him. Me and Jim talked about everything, he became my best friend really quick. I don't know why but I felt comfortable talking to him and telling him things that were happening with me, my friends, my boyfriend, and my family. He talked about his wife and 2 boys, he gave advice and was just very sweet, acted like he understood me and was very genuine. I now see as an adult he was manipulating me as a child but that little girl was craving for attention. We got to know each other, we talked all the way up to the day me and my dad and my friend were with us pulled up to the house after school and there Jim was sitting on our porch, just chilling. Thats when things got confusing and fucked up. I hate telling this story. It is so hard for me to realize what he was doing to me the whole time.. 

I don't really wanna get into the specifics. Um.. we Got close when he got out, He touched me multiple times, and also touched my friends. He gave me a ring at one point, Jim was 31 years old and I was 13 years old. It wasn't right and I hate that it went on as long as it did. He would kiss me when my dad wasn't around and tell me he loved me. Until the night it all ended. My friend came over while Jim was there I had a boyfriend over and supposedly Jim raped her when I wasnt in the room. There were hickeys on her neck and she was partying and drinking like a rockstar when I left her. I still have no idea what happened that night we even remained friends for a long time after and she never talked about it. I confessed to her that he was doing the same shit to me as he had been touching me for almost a year. She eventually did go to the police that night and she told them about me and everything that was happening. The police charged Jim with 2 counts of sexual imposition with a minor and 1 count rape he got 6 years. I always felt so guilty for sending him to prison, I hated that I had to tell I was ashamed of what he did to me but I was a child. When Jim had 6 months left in his sentence he killed himself in prison. I still don't know if that is true, how he died but I have had to go through years of trying to accept this in my past and live life to the fullest everyday without the reminder of what Jim did to me. I still can't tell you how it affected me, I guess it did in all kinds of ways and me wanting the attention in the first place makes me wonder. Growing up with my father letting me do whatever I wanted mainly because he only had my part time and I didnt think he ever wanted to be ""the bad guy"". He was more of a friend to me and when he drank too much it could turn bad quick. All of it is in the past and I have tried my whole life to forgive myself for my part in his death. I wanted to tell some of my story. it goes farther than this but i needed to get it out into the world.

I want to make this clear, my dad was an addict/alcoholic. He did the best he could with what he was given, even though he was asleep during this event and many others, he was clueless but now looking back as a recovering addict that it wasn't my dads fault. We trusted this man, he was a close family friend for many many years. We never thought that he would target 3 teenage girls. I thought the man really cared about me and I believed what he told me. 

Years later I changed schools my sophomore year and was in a small class with 2 girls and this geeky guy. (This was the year I found out Jim died) One of the girls, lets call her Ashley was telling our science teacher how her nephews dad was in prison and had just died, he was in the for 6 years for rape. She said that the girl lied and it was sad that her nephew had to lose his dad, she said that her Aunt Jims kids mom was distraught and in shock he could ever do the things he was accused of. I knew she was talking about me, I kept it to myself. What happened happened, I can't change a thing. 

This is me moving on and not being afraid to face any fear because I faced my biggest one. I will never stop healing but I can finally move on and let go. So Goodbye Jim.",7,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1jsn1m2,1743917729,4/6/2025 5:35,self,My younger brother's (19M) friend (20M) sneaked into my room while everyone was asleep.,"So this morning, while I 24F was asleep, my younger brother’s friend (who lives in the same building and whom I’ve known since childhood) sneaked into our house—and then into my room—while everyone was asleep except for my mum, who had gone for a morning walk so, the main door was unlocked. He quietly reached for my left hand and tried to unlock my phone using my fingerprint. Luckily, that’s when I felt someone holding my hand and woke up. At first, I thought it was my brother, so without thinking much, I asked, “What do you want?” He immediately pulled away and ran out of the room.  

I was completely shocked to see him in my room inside our home at that hour, when everyone was still asleep. I asked him what was going on, and he just said he came to see my brother. I was still trying to process everything. It felt really creepy. Like, why would he sneak into my room that early in the morning?

The creepiest part was, I didn’t even know how long he had been in my room or when exactly he sneaked in.  

I didn’t overthink it at the time and just locked my door. I considered telling his parents about it, but then again, it’s not like I see him as a pervert or anything. He’s never seemed like that. So instead, I went and woke up my brother and told him everything. He told me that his friend has been going through depression.  

I don’t know do people with depression normally do stuff like this? When I told my brother, he actually got really angry and wanted to confront him right away, but I was the one who stopped him. I thought maybe there was some reason behind why he did what he did. My brother also told me this wasn’t the first time he tried sneaking into our house. Apparently, my mum had once caught him early in the morning trying to open our main door, but he failed. She found it weird too, especially since he could’ve just rung the bell but didn’t.

Later, I told my mum what had happened, and she immediately went to their place to confront him and let his family know what he did. (My parents are super protective when it comes to their kids.) But what shocked me the most was that he told his parents a completely different version of the story.

My mum explained everything exactly how it happened, and his response was: he didn’t know it was me in the bed. he thought it was my brother. When my mum asked why he didn’t just call out my brother’s name, he said he didn’t want to wake him up.

Now that was creepy. Even my mum felt the same. It was 7 in the morning how the hell did he not see my face when I could clearly see his the moment I opened my eyes? He’s been coming to our place since he was a kid. He knows which room belongs to who. That just made the whole thing even more unsettling.



P.S- I just added some more details to clarify because it seems like some people are assuming my brother was involved or didn’t react the way he should’ve. But honestly, the moment I told him what happened, he got really angry and wanted to confront his friend on the spot. It wasn’t him who stayed quiet... it was me who stopped him. 
Our families have known each other for years, and I’ve literally seen his friend grow up. I’ve never seen him do anything like this before, not even once until today. That’s the only reason I held my brother back. I thought maybe there was some deeper reason behind why he acted that way.
But then I told my mum about the whole incident later.

1dawisl,1717828322,6/8/2024 6:32,TrueOffMyChest,I (17M) was sexually harassed by a staff member at my high-school (Early 30's F) ,"All the good stuff, throw away account, names have been changed, Intentionally vague details. Also this story happened to me 10+ years ago.

This is a story that to this day I've only told parts of to a handful of people. However, enough time has past that i feel it would do me some good to get the full story off my chest. Also sorry about the wall of text, It looks like I’ve spilled the tea and kettle.

TL;DR - Back in the early 2010's I (Then 17 M) received, and subsequently did not accept, sexual advances from a (Then early 30's F) married, pregnant, teachers assistant. I then spent the rest of the school year diffusing the situation.

It was my senior year of high-school in a very small rural town. When i say small i mean that the entire high school consisted of less than 50 students. Julie was the school's new computer lab tech (not sure of actual job title). She was in charge of maintaining the schools computers. Whenever we had a class that we needed to use the computers for, she would help the teacher to monitor us students and make sure no one was playing flash games, or checking social media, etc. Julie had a very ""flirtatious"" vibe. She would regularly have playful conversations with all us students. This was not sexual by any means, more so teasing and poking fun. She acted more like a fellow student with us than a superior. In general, this made lots of students (myself included) enjoy our classes with her as she wasn't as strict and classes weren't boring. Julie was also a mother of 2. Her and her husband (lets call him Dave) moved to town where she found this job and her husband worked in a manual/skilled labourer job. Julie became pregnant shortly into the school year and began showing by the time second semester came around. Little did i know, that that was around the time her opinion of me started to change.

Hindsight tells me that the catalyst for Julie's newfound lust was probably during a ""gender swap"" day the school had during one of the regular ""spirit weeks"" they would put on. The premise of this day was for guys to show up dressed as girls, and vise versa. (I know, very gender binary.) I didn't dress any different but a few did. Julie showed up that day with several very feminine costumes that she had (Think ""sexy"" Halloween costume type of clothing). during breaks she was bugging the male students to show some spirit and put them on. Most of the guys where too cool/embarrassed to oblige. I however, thought that it would at least get a laugh out of Sophie, a good friend. So, I grabbed the skimpiest top and went to the change room. I came out in a very tight, pink, sleeveless, corset style dress with jeans underneath. I went up to George and did a ""Bro, can you do up my corset?"" bit and it got a couple laughs. The memory that sticks in my mind the most from that day is Julie saying something to the effect of ""Wow, you have a strong muscular back"". I guess it's true what they say about giving a guy a compliment and he will remember it for the rest of his life because i still remember the joy that compliment gave me to this day. At that time I was skinny like a string bean having lost a bunch of weight due to puberty and a change in activity so complimenting my defined back while in a tight corset truly was flattering. Anyways, I feel like this was the first comment Julie made to me that crossed a line and possibly planted a seed in her mind. However, at the time i thought nothing of it and just took it as a nice compliment.

Awhile later, Julie began to question me about my current on again/off again relationship with Isabella a fellow student. Now, even from Julie’s outside perspective it was probably very easy to see the signs of a bad relationship. Isabella would regularly string me and other guys along. Julie picked up on this and at an opportune time when i was alone with her, She simply ask “What’s up with you guys?” When i didn’t have a good answer she said something along the lines of “You deserve better” and left it at that. From there, she would proceed to make small remarks like passing her in the hall she would say something like “Hey during chem class i noticed Isabella flirting with Roy.” My oblivious ass still didn’t raise any suspicion or think it was odd that a Staff member was concerning themselves this heavily in high school dating life drama. I thought she was simply looking out for me. One day, my group of friend was in the computer lab over lunch and Julie began complaining about having ordered take-out from the local restaurant but having to walk all the way there and back to get it. I happened to have drove myself to school that day and thought nothing of offering to give her a ride. After all, she was pregnant and i seen it as nothing more than a friendly favour. So we went off school property, just the two of us (I know) and got her lunch. It wasn’t till the return trip when once again she brought up Isabella. I ended up opening up to her a bit about knowing that she’s not right for me but not wanting to hurt her. We pulled back into the school lot as Julie was telling me that I’m “too nice of a guy” I shrugged it off as she turned to me while opening the door and said “You know, nice guys always finish last”. I can’t say for certain what it was about how she said that it, but there was a certain smoulder in that last line. It was at this moment when I began to question the way Julie felt about me. I still didn’t believe it though, Because “of coarse she isn’t in to me”. I once again rationalized this interaction as just her looking out for me which aside form the sexual innuendo, was genuinely relationship advice that i needed to hear at the time.

The next couple weeks pass as normal, aside from me making an effort to distance myself form Isabella. I guess the advice sunk in. One day, during last period I was in the computer lab working on a paper. I was trying my best not to notice Isabella at the far side of the lab. She was sitting next to Roy with her legs across his lap, giggling, and making no effort to hide their new relationship. I had Facebook tabbed and was catching up on my timeline as any kid that wanted to fit in did at the time. I made minimal efforts to hide what I was doing, as Julie was the only one supervising at the time and i knew she was cool about computer use. Out of nowhere, I get a FB message. It’s from Julie who I wasn’t even friends with on the site. She messaged “God, what a bitch” clearly in reference to Isabella. I remember looking over to Julie and her giving a friendly smirk. I responded simply, “Haha, yea” thinking that would be the end of the interaction. It wasn’t. She proceeded to carry on with the conversation. Not wanting to be rude I responded, but was unsure why she was continuing on. Once school ended and I was now home, Julie’s tone became very complimentary as if to butter me up. She then asked me if I’ve ever watched Billy Madison. Having seen the movie, time almost came to a stop as I began to speculate what she was going to say next. She then said something in reference to the hot for teacher plot and how she enjoyed it. My stomach physical churned and i instantly broke out into a cold sweat. I felt sick, I felt wrong, I felt like every molecule of my being was violently rejecting the message I had just read. At this point, it was clear to me. Julie fantasized about having sex with me.

I proceeded to freak out. I wanted nothing to do with any of this. It was wrong to me on so many levels, and worst of all I didn’t know how to get out of it. Through my sheer blindness to pick up on any of the signs, I had let Julie get far to comfortable and get the wrong idea. I was scared to turn her down, as I didn’t know how she’d handle the rejection. Would she not take No as an answer? Would she get scared that i would tell someone and try to get ahead of it by telling Dave(her husband) that I made a move on her? Would she force herself on me, to try and keep me from talking? I just didn’t know. I felt powerless to stop this as I felt that she was the adult here and it would be her word against mine. I couldn’t tell anyone else either. If this ever got out I was sure that cops would get involved and possibly the news. I didn’t want any of that attention. Not to mention, I began to get increasingly scared about Dave. He gave off the vibe of the type of guy that would have no problem resorting to violence upon hearing about his unfaithful wife. Also, I didn’t want to break up a family. What would that do to the kids? I needed a plan of how to best dodge all these bullets, while also protecting myself. I knew that in case things did go bad, what i needed was concrete evidence. While the meaning behind Julie’s message was clear to me, she didn’t outright admit to her intentions. It made me sick to think about, but I knew I had to keep this conversation going until she said something clearly explicit. I began to respond using as few words as i could, also making no comment to say that I agreed or consented. She just kept going eventually saying something along the lines of “I want you to be my muse” and then finally “God, I could just jump you right now”. Felling that this was enough and not being able to handle this conversation anymore, I simply ghosted. I now had my smoking gun.

For the next couple weeks, I made myself scarce. I avoided all interactions with Julie, not even making eye contact. I knew there was safety in numbers, and as long as I stayed in a group of friends she couldn’t try anything. I became very anxious about knowing what my classmates plans where over lunch and breaks to try and keep myself surrounded. My main goal was to let her come to the realization that I wasn’t interested on her own hoping that it would lessen her urge to want to escalate. I also felt that the time might make her come to her senses and realize what she was thinking was wrong in the first place. It didn’t seem to be working, as Julie tried a few times to message me again. My fear was warranted.

I had a class that I took through online correspondence, and so needed to use a computer. I opted to go to the computer lab in the attached elementary school. This is something that a handful of high-schoolers did during periods that the elementary didn't have it booked, and I began to as well since Julie stayed in the high-school lab. It was only myself and a few other classmates at the time when Julie came into the lab and began to hand out flyers for the next school event. I had my chair pushed away from the table and was slightly reclined into it. As she passed behind me instead of placing the flyer on the table by the computer, she reached over my shoulder placing the flyer in my lap. She then let her arm almost go limp and she traced a finger up my chest and slightly tugged at my shirt. I felt utterly scandalized. Not only was I wrong about feeling safe around others, but she clearly wanted to keep pursuing me. I knew i couldn’t avoid her at school.

At this point, I was heavily considering telling my friends. If for no other reason then the fact that I just couldn’t handle the stress. The moment came on a school field trip in which Julie didn’t attend. I was sitting with a small circle of friends and the topic of Julie came up, and not being able to take it anymore I told them my story. I was terrified of getting a bad reaction, of one of the guys trying to down play it or think it was cool, or of someone else urging me that I needed to tell the authorities. The main reaction I had got was skepticism, to which I had the proof. I remember pleading with the group that this secret can’t get out right before showing them the messages. I then watched as my phone got handed around and one by one people realized I was telling the truth.

For the next few days, I was on pins and needles. As you could expect this story travelled like wildfire and before we were even back from the field trip, the whole high-school knew. I didn’t know what to expect. I thought that surely someone was bound to tell their parents, but no one did. I think that everyone came to the same realization of just how nuclear this secret would be if it came out and so it just became a group secret. From then on, it seemed like everything had changed. Any class that I had to be in the computer lab for, I’d notice my friends closer around me. Some of the guys began looking for more opportunities to chat and try flirting with Julie, while I feel that the girls in my grade kept a closer watch on her with judgmental eyes. I’m sure that this change was noticeable enough for Julie to realize what had happened and, realizing that the whole high-school secretly knew, she didn’t make anymore advances towards me.

I don’t know if this is the most satisfying ending to this story, but it’s how it ended non the less. To this day, I don’t think anyone outside of my fellow alumni ever found out. Julie and Dave Stayed together for a few years before divorcing over what I can only assume was his drug problem as he’s been in and out of jail for drug relate crimes ever since.",7,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

105dtex,1673060083,1/7/2023 2:54,offmychest,I don't know myself (I'm sorry. ik this is a massive post.),"TW: bullying, abuse, sh, suicidal thoughts, depression

I have been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember. I first noticed it when I was in grade 7 (7 years ago now, but the symptoms stretched well before then) as I was learning more about mental illnesses to try and help support my abuser. This person is the root of the majority of my trauma as a child, and well into my preteens, before I moved across the country and could cut her out of my life without her trying to kill herself in front of me. she started by bullying me when we were three, then she sexually assaulted me from when I was in grade 2 until we were in grade 7. I know this also means that she was also sexually abused, but I can not bring myself to forgive her for this. she hit me, punched me, isolated me, kicked me, basically did everything imaginable for those first couple years.

But it got better, or so i thought, when one day in grade 5 it just stopped. she had decided she liked me now. So i did what any naïve 5th grader would do, become her friend. I was good for the next couple years as i tended to her every need, learning to walk on eggshells so she wouldn't go back to hurting me, physically at least. going into grade 7, I was happy with how our friendship had developed. she stopped treating me like shit and stopped spreading lies and rumors about me. I wish i could go back in time and beg my parents to let me switch schools. I wish I could go back to when I first told them about her (i was 4) and made them listen. make them understand with the words I have now, not the words that i lacked as a child.

anyway, the good times didn't last, as they tend to, and she started threatening to kill herself. We were 11. about every other week so would text me, telling me how depressed she was and how she didn't want to be here anymore. I didn't fully understand her then, but i can now see why she didn't want to be alive anymore. she's still alive today, so she didn't do it and it become tiresome. it devolved from me crying to my mother that she was going to kill herself to walking up to her room and her response was ""again?"". it sounds cruel, but when these threats came so often, the majority of them were for attention. I was trying to save my best friend and favorite person (yes, like BPD favorite person) from killing themselves at age 11. not to mention all the pictures i got of her fresh cuts. or the ways she would describe, in graphic detail, how she was going to kill herself that weekend.

This year was also the year that I started to find different ways to escape. I grew up very sheltered and my school was very small, so i didn't turn to substances (even tho I know I would have if given the chance). Instead, I escaped into my head. I have always had an overactive imagination, but this was a while new level. I did not know what was real or not. whenever i watched or played something, i would start falling for the characters. i was not able to deal with real life, so i went to living through stories, shows, music, games, celebrities. any and everything i could possibly get my 12 year old hands on to.

This included things like fanfic, which quickly devolved into smut. there is nothing wrong with reading smut, but as a sheltered 12 year old that barley knew what sex was, it was damaging to say the least. I wont go into too much detail with this point, as its not that necessary, but the main point is that how i understood relationships and sex was through the lens of a poorly written smutfic about a fictional character written by someone probably only one or two years my senior. I also have, to this day, never been in a relationship (which I'll talk about more later), but so I would live vicariously through these stories. these characters were the only ones that i felt could love me. I knew that no matter what, i could depend on them because i could imagine them to be dependable. When i was interacting with these medias i was myself, so i felt as though these characters knew me, knew the real me.

school was hostile, home was hostile. my mom and sister were constantly fighting. it didn't matter if we were driving to school, eating supper, getting back from activities. constant yelling. it got so bad that my mom threatened to call the police on my sister. I was trying to escape to my own little world in my headphones, but their screams always seem to shine through in my memories. my sister still treats me poorly to this day. its less yelling and more making me feel like shit. she constantly would talk down to me, make fun of what I like (the few things that actually gave me purpose, as stupid as it sounds), and try to to catch me in lies that i wasn't telling. I spent all my time in my room, but she was convinced that i was sneaking out like she did. Also she tried to out me to my homophobic mother, that didnt work thankfully, or else i wouldn't have a place to live.

I moved in grade 9, after a year and a half of not knowing where i would go. it felt freeing and also trapping at the same time. I was free to be whoever i wanted to. I got a new start. I got away from my abuser. but i was also trapped in my experiences. i was trapped in my past since i started to remember the horrible things that was done to me when i was a little kid. i was finally understanding what happened to me. i was understanding that my parents continuously rejected all of my attempts to tell them. I started self harming. my parents found out. i got sent to therapy. i was getting better. I was dealing with my past and i forgave my abuser. not for her, but for me. i was letting her go. was.

then covid happened. it is no surprise that covid affected me poorly, it affected everybody poorly. i stopped going to therapy. i stayed inside. i barley talked to anybody. but i was content. i've always preferred being by myself. i could unmask and be myself. but i knew it was bad for me, so in started talking to my friends again and it was good. I was still depressed, but it was a bit better. i would get flashback every now and them, but with time those also subsided. school started again and i was in grade 11, the worst for me was that i was kinda out of it the whole time, but that can be said for my entire life. i dissociated my whole life away, so one year isn't that significant in the grand scheme of things. anyway, i slowly started losing all my friends from before i move, except one (im still friends with her and i love her to death), and i started to realize that i didn't have long term friends. i saw all these people around me with childhood friends. people that have known them their entire life. but i didn't. the longest friendship at that time was two years old. everyone else was gone. 

grade 12 was when things went down hill again. it was good for the first semester, but then my friends met someone online and me and him become really close. I was never romantic, from either of us i believe, but he become my favorite person. I did not realize this until after we stopped being friends, but this would lead our friendship to ruin in due time. he was the first person that i ever truly opened up to. i told him about not only my story, but also how it affected me. i remember taking my dog on a walk and sitting on a bench while on vc with him and sobbing because i wanted to die. when i was going through an bad episode, we would vc until i feel asleep. but again, this ended just as quickly as it began. as much as it was good for me at the time, it was bad in the long run as my mental health started to plummet. 

i didn't have many friends in high school. i had horrible social anxiety (like heart pounding, cant think, about to throw up if i talked once in class type). and massive trust and abandonment issues in addition.

 i have always felt like no one really knows me, but that brings up the question, do i know myself? i have masked and mirrored so many people in my life that i don't even know who i am. what i enjoy changes depending on what my friends at the time are doing. if its what i'm [REDACTED_NAME] by myself, then that means, at my core, i am [REDACTED_NAME] depressed and suicidal. i don't even have a laugh. i mirror the laugh of whoever im closest friends with at the time. i am [REDACTED_NAME] my own person. i am [REDACTED_NAME] of everybody that has come in and out of my life. the hardest part about that is that it means my abuser is apart of me. i know that when i say this people automatically try and say ""no. you're nothing like her"" but i know i am. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of her than i would like to admit. i can still seer her mannerisms and speech patterns in my day to day life. habits i picked up while trying to not set her off. she would dump her problems on me then leave. i cant help but feel the same way whenever i talk about my problems. she has hurt me beyond belief, yet i loved her, and i still do. my first 14 years of my life were dedicated to her, then my next 3 were about trying to recover from the damage.

 i feel empty now. not just because im without her. everybody i have poured my love into has left me. once they knew who i was they left. i have lived so many lives through so many people, but i have yet to live my own. and i do not want to.  i do not remember a single moment of my life. i do not have memories, i have facts. i know what happened, but they are not memories in my head. 

i am [REDACTED_NAME] the point where i do not remember who i am, nor my experiences. i am [REDACTED_NAME] university and i cant bring myself to talk about anything. the only thing that has stopped my from killing myself is that i havent gotten around to it. i thought at 12 i would be dead by 14. at 14 i thought id be dead at 16. at 16 i thought id be dead at 18. and now im 18. ive been expecting my death for the past 6 years and im still here because i thought i would just get hit by a car, or die in a freak accident. i didn't make plans or have aspirations because what was the point? id be dead in two years anyway. i am [REDACTED_NAME] lost in life. this first semester of uni has completely gone by and i can barley remember any of it. i started forgetting my childhood, but i was slowly losing memories that were more and more recent. and now i cant remember anything. i am [REDACTED_NAME] ready for everything to just be done.

I guess this is a confession about confessing.



About a year ago, I had a strange stalker. At first, I was just annoyed. It was a couple of emails sent to me declaring I was a bad person. Because the emails said that the person just happened across (my very private that's only shared with a handful of people) blog, I didn't think much about it. As my story goes on, you'll find I have zero regard for my safety.



Then started the texting. Again, it was mostly annoying, empty stuff. Nothing that really made me feel threatened. Just severely hated by a random person as it was mostly attacks against my supposed personality.



Later that night, there was a cut-up teddy bear on my doorstep. You would think I'd have gone to the police after that. But no, I just ate my qdoba, watched a terrible tv show I won't confess to, and then to bed. I ignored anyone that tried to call or chat with me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure why...almost like I didn't want anyone to talk me into going to the police.



The next morning I did tell my boyfriend at the time. He urged me to go to the police and stay with a friend (BF didn't live in my city) instead of at my apartment by myself. Well duh. That seems like the obvious choice. So I did all that, the police said they'd send a car to patrol my apartment, but that there wasn't much else they could do.



After that though, the stalker stopped for awhile. I almost forgot about him until the texting started again. This time the texts contained information that I didn't think was in my blog. Things I'd only told a friend via g-chat. Concerned (slightly), I looked through my gmail IP logs and didn't find anything suspicious. But I ruminated more about it. His early emails also contained things I couldn't find in my blog. But I didn't use common sense. I didn't change my email pw. I'd reported his first emails to gmail awhiles ago, but that was about it. And I certainly didn't think to change my number. I wondered if it was someone I knew because of some of the details. I think I was too proud to admit that *I* had been hacked.




I moved far away from that apartment for a new job and broke up with my then-boyfriend. I was feeling good. I felt like I had a handle on my life and I was off meds (bipolar and borderline). And I was getting to start over and get out of a miserable relationship. But that was dumb. I was cutting at the time and that should have been a red-flag for me. Cutting and taking zero care of my health/appearance is the first step to my downward spirals. I know this. I ignored this. I thought I was okay without meds.



I got a few texts here and there, but again, I didn't really think much about it. Again, that should have been another red-flag for me. Bipolar people don't think about their safety. In fact, we'll walk into dangerous situations purely for the self-sabotage. Didn't think about. Didn't seek help. Didn't get back on meds. My ex said he got strange texts and I still didn't do anything about it. Honestly, the texts weren't very threatening. Just...annoying and stupid. And extremely non-sensical. Like the guy didn't know how to use grammar...very different from his first email to me, which sounded very formal. Slightly intelligent even.



Shortly after moving, I met a new guy. An amazing guy. We were slowly getting to know each other when the stalker began bothering him (I think). The problem is, I didn't tell him that this person was *my* stalker, not his. He told me the alias of the mass texts he was giving and I didn't tell him. What should have gone through my head was ""holy crap, there's a person from my old place now bothering me in my new place,"" but instead I kept quiet.



Meanwhile, I entered a severely depressed state. I went from cutting to downright suicidal. My parents began this incessant ""why aren't you married yet,"" tirade. The problem is, every time my parents bring up marriage, I dwell on how I've fucked up my other relationships.


My first relationship was horrible. I don't blame him for hating me because he put up with so much when I never sought out help (my parents don't believe in meds, therapy, mental illnesses and a HS student has no independent options really). It was the first time I realized I was capable of being my dad. For 18 years, I learned physical and sexual abuse. The first time I hit my boyfriend, I was horrified. I told myself that would never happen again. I wish he'd been more stern with me about it, but he never considered it as serious as I did. He even tried to make me feel better about it by saying ""it wasn't hard, it didn't hurt me."" That's not the point! The point is, you don't hit people you love. wtf. And then I did it again and again. I entered college and immediately went into therapy. My first line was, ""My dad hit me and now I hit my boyfriend and I'm [REDACTED_NAME]."" While I was working on that, I felt like this wasn't the relationship for me. So I tried to walk out of it, but the guy threatened suicide and I tried again. At this point, the total relationship hit rock bottom. It was a fight everyday. And I was feeling extremely resentful of his suicide threats because I was genuinely suicidal. And as someone struggling so hard with suicidal thoughts, I knew how hard it was to actually talk about it. Most of my friends didn't know.



Then, I don't know why I did it really. It was a night without much thinking....I managed to convince that boyfriend that I'd died. The problem was, that quickly turned into everyone thinking I was dead and me being like, ""oh shit oh shit oh shit, so here's the thing guys...""


Needless to say, we broke up for good shortly after that and I lost a set of friends. As years passed and I made new friends, I'd retell them this story. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure why. My way of warning them I guess. The problem is, they all thought I'd changed or something. But at this point, I'd never taken meds and I was incredibly emotionally unstable. That's putting it lightly.




My second boyfriend...well the only thing I can say for that relationship was that I learned that I no longer had a hitting problem. It was one accomplishment that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of. It was a relationship that tested my temper over and over again. My friends tried to tell me that he wasn't a nice guy and that I should end the relationship. I didn't believe them even though he'd honestly driven me to cutting again. He would say he loved me one day and the next week say he wasn't sure he did. At this point I'd never really done anything bad in the relationship and then one day, I hit another manic episode and began doing very stupid things.



Suddenly everyone thought I was dying of a terminal illness (one I knew nothing about but for some reason people believed me). Again I had the ""oh shit oh shit oh shit"" panic attacks. For two months I kept playing conversations out in my head of how to come clean to people. Finally, I did and lost all my friends again. For some reason my boyfriend still stuck around as a friend...until I started dating again. Then he decided, ""All this time I was fooling myself into thinking you were worth being friends with.""



This hurt me. It hurt because this was the relationship that I genuinely sought help. This was the relationship where I was diagnosed bipolar-borderline and put on meds. This was the relationship where I finally felt like a good person after a year. Suddenly when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and happy again, he decided not to be friends with me.



The point is, when my parents bring up marriage, it sends me into anxiety because I think about all these terrible things I've done and that I *can't* get married. Maybe my parents thought it was okay to bring a child into the world without fixing their need to beat a child. Without fixing the need to do sexually inappropriate things to a child. I can't handle the idea of having an emotionally safe environment. The only thing I've ever wanted is the happy family I never had. But I *can't* do that. At least, not now.




I thought my problem of desperation was fixed. Then I did something terrible to my current boyfriend. He was out one night. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if I'd texted him, he'd have eventually texted me back. Without thinking, I did something the stalker did to me. I called from random numbers. I didn't think about how this would worry him. I was just feeling *So* suicidal and I wanted him to call me. And he did. He was worried the stalker was bothering me too. I vageuly remember him offering him to come over later if I needed him. I quickly said no and that I'd be okay. I hung up in shame. I vowed I'd never do that again.



Except I did it many times. I did it past a point where the stalker stopped bothering me (I think) and continued to do this to my boyfriend. Every time I felt like cutting or killing myself, instead of telling him this is how I was feeling, I did the fake calling. After hanging up, I'd feel even more suicidal over what a bad person I was and it just never ended. I tried to stop but for some reason I couldn't get myself to stop before I did.



At some point, I should have thought, ""You really need help and need to get back on meds."" I didn't.


It got really bad one day and I thought, okay, today is the day I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to kill myself. I had a bunch of plans going through my head, so I went to a store and bought several supplies (I think). I had a lot of prescription drugs leftover from when I'd stopped taking them, and I popped a lot before and after the store. Apparently you hallucinate a ton after OD'ing on seroquil. You'd think I was smart enough to know that.



No, I woke up, convinced I'd made it to the hotel I planned on killing myself at, got raped and cut there (wtf), somehow made it back to my car, and was still at the store I drove to. I was *so* confused when I woke up. My boyfriend was freaking out from not hearing from me. I called him, still kinda' fuzzy and he told me to come over. I remember trying to drive and then stopping the car because I didn't feel okay to drive.



It was a weird-feeling state. I felt like I had control over my motions, but was in shock. I made it back to my boyfriend's and didn't tell him what had happened. He knew something was off and we just kind of sat in silence and listened to music until I'd calmed down enough to sleep.



Then began these nightmares. I was convinced I'd been raped. Even awake, I'd literally hear his voice. The memory is still so vivid to me. It turned up my suicidal notch tenfold.



My boyfriend was patient with me. He took care of me every night. Meanwhile, what was I doing? Making these god damn stupid calls instead of telling him how I felt and that I needed him. Sometimes I stopped myself and tried telling him the truth. It was getting insane.




I tried to drop hints....to lead up to what I was doing. I told him the bad things I'd done in my past relationships. I kept asking, ""so if I've done something similar, could you forgive me?"" But every time I got to present-day, I couldn't continue. I was afraid. I then tried seeking help, knowing I needed to get back on meds and that I needed severe help. But the first therapist I went to rejected me. ""This is something beyond that I can help.""



Well way to make me feel more suicidal. I gave up on finding help until I saw how stressed my suicidal feelings were making my boyfriend. I went to the hospital again and said I needed help finding help basically. They gave me a huge list of numbers to call and I left the same voicemail for 50+ doctors, hoping someone could see me ASAP.



Finally someone did. A lady who's both a psychiatrist and a therapist. I felt like my prayers had been answered. I felt like I was going insane between hearing voices and feeling my rapist, feeling intensely suicidal and hopeless, and the GUILT. Oh god. The guilt.




She saw me for a long time for my first appointment. She started asking me questions that made me feel extremely worried. She could tell I was getting anxious and she tried to assuage me. ""A lot of highly intelligent people suffer from schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder...but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to need more time to figure out which one you might have.""  ....excuse me?!



It was during that appointment that she pointed out that it was way more likely that I hallucinated the rape than it actually happening. I started freaking out. I was orally raped when I was 13 on top of the things my dad did that I don't want to go into. I know how serious rape is. I can see right past girls that do lie about it and it *angers* me how lightly we take rape culture. Suddenly I started feeling more guilty. Immediately after my appointment, I called my boyfriend and told him what had happened. I expected him to break-up with me.



Because after the ""rape"" happened, I went through a cycle of extreme anger that I had no one to take out on except those around me to continual tears and more intensely suicidal feelings. He put up with all that crap and it wasn't even real? Gah, I feel so awful.




I'm [REDACTED_NAME] back on meds and I feel more stable. Way less suicidal, but every time my parents contact me, the feelings come back. I think it's a reflex to anything they say to me really. I was still making the phone calls when these feelings came back.  For months, I've kept trying to think of a way to bring it up. I told myself that once I stopped, I'd confess and say ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] crazy anymore though!""



The problem is, I've only been on meds for 2 weeks and I'll go a week or so without making a call, then make a call. Finally, yesterday morning, my boyfriend calls me into the room and says, ""Is this you?""



I tried to fight it for like...15 seconds. Then I started confessing everything. 3 hours of confessing.



In my head, whenever I imagined the confession, I always pictured him yelling at me, calling me a bad person, and throwing me out of his place or walking out of mine.



Well this was worse. He didn't yell at me. He questioned me, trying to piece together the truth. He's pretty sure there was never a stalker and that it was me the entire time. That's fair for him to think because I've done nothing that would indicate otherwise.



The worst was his face and expression. In the past, when I've confessed my terrible sins, I've been met with faces of disgust and hatred. But he was *hurt*. It's the face of someone who got hurt by someone they trusted and loved. My feelings went from ""oh shit oh shit oh shit, how do i get out of this,"" to ""oh god, how could i have ever done this to *him*"". Why wasn't him being so damn kind to me enough? Why did I feel like I needed to do this? And why couldn't I see that just because I didn't have regard for my own safety that he clearly did. All the time he thought there was someone after him and it was me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] worst piece of shit out there.



I want to earn back his trust, but I couldn't honestly tell him I'm [REDACTED_NAME] better now! Because it just isn't true. I just started meds 3 weeks ago and a year out of therapy and back in it means I've got a ton of shit to work through again.



I'm [REDACTED_NAME] relieved that he finally does know the truth, but I never wanted to face the fact that I hurt someone I love so much. A part of me felt it daily, hence the anxiety and suicidal thoughts. But I never thought I'd ever see so much hurt on his face. He's never done anything to hurt me so bad and this is what I went around and did.




When I was in 7th grade, I had a friend. We had a pattern. I told her a story and a week later I would tell her, ""Actually, I don't think that happened. I lied."" She never had the hurt reaction. Instead, she said, ""Either you stop lying, or you learn to deal with your lies."" She once suggested I find a job where I could use my persuasion skills. That's probably when I should have cried for help.




I thought the problem started when I was 22 and my parents officially disowned me. I tried killing myself, someone found me, took me to the hospital, called my parents, and they decided to talk to me again. I thought that's when I'd learned that the only way someone could care about me was if I was in danger.




But the truth is, my problems started way before that and I should have gotten help sooner. I should have never gone off my meds. And even though I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I confessed everything, it'll never change my guilt over all this.",1,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p75xtp,1629340057,8/19/2021 2:27,confession,When I was 14 in high school I stole this girls diary and read stuff she wrote about me.,When I was probably 14 in high school I had this group of girls I would talk to. One of them my best friend and two other girls we just knew from previous years. One of the girls was always sensitive and insecure. She was very conservative and did not like anything that wasn’t following the rules. Me and the other two would tease her a lot about being “lame” or “boring” and try to pressure her into doing things like sneaking out or drinking. We just thought that we were the shit and that she should be grateful for getting to hang out with us. One day she invited me over to her house. I went over and when she left the room I started going through her stuff and found a little journal. I quickly flipped through it and saw my name as well as the other girls. I don’t know why but I just shoved it in my bag and left shortly after. I thought I could find some cringe or embarrassing things she wrote to laugh at. I remember riding my bike home so fast just so I could read this thing. I got home and read the entire thing. In part of the journal she said that “popdart31 made me cry for three hours straight”. She wrote about how I and the others would bully her. I went back a few days later and put it back where I found it. I will never forget how bad I felt realizing that the shit I said to her actually hurt her. I never spoke to her again after that. I thought she would be better off without me around her. I even dropped out of the club we were in together. I never told anyone I stole her diary because there’s no excuse for that. I wanted to read it to embarrass her yet I was the one embarrassed,4307,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d24lsj,1568103546,9/10/2019 8:19,stories,I hate my growths,"

I wanted to put my story out there, in hopes of possibly helping someone else. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] there's at least a few people out there like me.


It all started when I was a kid. My mother died in childbirth, and my father raised my brother and I. We lived in a small town, but lived a good distance away, so we pretty much stayed close to home.  My brother and the other neighborhood kids played in the woods and creek by our house. I thought life would always be happy and carefree.....


I first noticed them when I was 9. I was getting ready for school that morning and I happened to see it in the mirrors reflection. I was confused, but I wasn't scared, yet.. 

I just kept thinking it would go away. Probably a bug bite or something like it, and it would heal on its own. It wasn't big enough to be seen through my clothing, so I didn't bother mentioning it to dad. 

I tried to push it from my mind, and being 9, it wasn't too hard to get lost in school work, and after school play. It wasn't as if I had forgotten about it. But I didn't constantly worry about it either. 

It wasn't until a few weeks after my 11th birthday that panic really set in. 



I was playing with my brother in the creek, when I happened to notice a slight feeling…  as if something was moving on my skin. I looked down, pulling my shirt out a bit, thinking a bug or some animal had gotten in there somehow, when I saw them.  I nearly screamed. Instead of just a tiny one, now there were two. And they were larger. Much larger than before, as if they had grown overnight. My brother must have noticed my reaction, and came over to check on me. I quickly covered my growths - that's what I'd begun to think of them as - and we went home, me trying to hide my secret the entire way. 



For the next month I avoided wearing tight fitting clothes, and stayed to myself as much as possible.

But I knew the problem wasn't going to get better, not on its own. I would have to tell my father. I planned to tell him one night after dinner. But the words were stuck in my throat. 

I helped him clear the table, waiting for the right moment. I waited until my brother took the dogs outside, and then as my father washed and I dried, I told him. I still remember the look on his face. He had been washing the salad bowl, and at the moment I said the words he nearly dropped it. My fear suddenly became overwhelming. Fathers weren't supposed to be scared. He  must have seen my reaction and set the bowl in the sink, and knelt in front of me. 


""It's ok. Don't worry about anything."" He said, and he smiled but it wasn't like his normal smiles. It was the same smile he had when he told my brother and I our dog, champ died and would be in heaven with Mom. 


""But .. they got bigger. What if they keep growing?"" I asked in a scared voice. ""Am I gonna die?"" 


Tears started falling then. He hugged me tight, and after a moment he said, ""Of course not. We'll take you to see the doctor. Maybe tomorrow if he's able. Don't worry."" 


I felt better that night. It was finally out in the open. It wasn't my secret to hide anymore. We did go see doctor Hadley. He was about 100 in my 11 year old mind, but was probably more like 65. He had gray hair and gray eyebrows that always reminded me of the caterpillars I used to find in our garden. He smelled like peppermint toothpaste, and the stinging smell of alcohol, that reminded me of the shots he gave. My father left the room when it was time to show the doctor my growths. It was like he was embarrassed by them, or afraid he'd catch them….. 


The doctor only looked for a second. Then quickly looked up at me, his eyes worried like my fathers had been. Had they grown? My panicked mind raced. I couldn't be sure. The doctor tried to smile, but even at 11 I knew when someone was pretending. 


""What's wrong?"" I had asked him. My blood pounded in my ears. He cleared his throat, and went into a long speech mainly consisting of medical jargon that I didn't fully comprehend. When he finished and asked if I understood I nodded, but I really only understood one thing. 

Untreatable. No cure. No way to stop it. And according to doctor Hadley, the growths would most likely continue to grow. I ran from his office, tears staining my face, my father running after me. I didn't eat that night. Or the next morning. My father tried to talk to me, but I heard nothing. I was going to be a freak. Forever. 

I begged my father to let me stay home, but he refused. I rarely left the house except for school, and always wore loose fitting clothes. 

The kids didn't seem to notice, at least until one day during break. Mr Bolger let us go outside to play kickball after Math, and I was completely into the game, forgetting my growths, when Franky ran into me knocking me down on my back. It knocked the wind right out of me, and I lay there on the grass trying to force air into my lungs. When I finally began to breathe normally I opened my eyes to see Franky and the others standing over me, their eyes like saucers. I looked down at myself and felt the air sucked from my lungs for the second time. My shirt was ripped and a growth was clearly visible. 


I struggled to cover it, and get to my feet. ""Holy shit"" Franky said, his voice low so Mr Bolger didn't hear. The others joined in, some laughing, some just staring at me with open mouths. I guess I can't blame them, looking back. But at the time I was furious. I ran as fast as I could, their hollering, and laughter following me. I didn't stop even when Mr Bolger called after me. I didn't stop until I was too far away to hear the laughter. 


The years went by with me keeping to myself. I rarely went anywhere except school, and when I left the house I was well covered, even in summer. I got used to the staring, laughing, pointing. 

I just pretended I couldn't hear them. 


When I moved away for college I hadn't been happier. I didn't have to share a room with anyone, thankfully. I still avoided friends, opting to keep to myself. 

I had access to computers at the school library, and spent all my free time searching for cures or treatments, and talking to people like me in support groups. Some had their growths in other places, growths that looked much different than mine. Those people became my true friends. They also helped me find a doctor who could remove the growths. 

I met the doctor one morning, and was so excited I barely slept the night before. 


But unfortunately he looked at the growths - which had grown considerably since I was 11 - and said he wouldn't be able to perform the surgery unless they were causing health problems. He gave me a useless referral to see another doctor, and sent me on my way. I never went to see the other doctor. I came to realize that no one could help me. 

If I wanted to be normal and growth free, I'd have to help myself. 


And that brings me to now. I locked myself in my room with a few supplies. One of my friends from the support groups sent me instructions on how to remove the growths myself. He did it a few years prior and said it worked wonderfully. He warned me about the possible dangers, and of course, the pain. But I wouldn't be swayed. 

I got all the supplies listed, and locked the door in case I screamed too loud. 

I put a few trash bags  on the floor to stand on to catch any blood, and pressed the sharpened knife to the growth, sawing through it. I'll admit, it took a good while to get started, but it didn't take long to realize how much pressure I'd need. 

I bit down on a washcloth, but despite the warnings of pain, all I really felt was relief. Relief and excitement. 


There was some pain, and more blood than I imagined. But when that hideous growth fell to the floor all I felt was pure joy. 


I'm [REDACTED_NAME] bleeding pretty bad, and nearly loss consciousness twice so I had to stop before starting the other one.

But I wanted to write this while I wait, for anyone out there like me who thought they were doomed to live life with their growths, their dark secret.

It's possible to find a cure. You just need to want it bad enough, and a sharp knife. You'll also need a lot of towels to stop the blood. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on my sixth one.


I have to go now. I may need to take a nap before I start the last one.. I feel dizzy, but it's all worth it. Remember, you're not alone. And despite what doctors say, the growths can be stopped. I smile when I think back to Dr Hadley telling me I'd have the growths forever. He even tried to tell me my growths were normal. Except he used medical terminology, and called them ""breasts"" 

But whatever the term, my growths are nearly gone. I just pray they won't grow back...",54,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3nf2xb,1443931194,10/4/2015 3:59,confession,I indirectly killed the love of my life.,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad.

So before I tell you my story, Let me say, I did NOT KILL ANYBODY. Also, before I confess my biggest secret, I will give a little bit of a background. I will not say my location and I will change names, because I don't want anyone in the outside world to know this.

15 years ago, I was 6 yrs old, I looked out my window and I saw a moving truck across the street. I was excited because that house has been vacant for a while and I was in need of a new friend. I was a shy kid. I had no friends, and I was embarrassingly awkward. I stared out the window for an hour for a hint of who the occupants were. I saw her; a little girl my age with blonde goldilocks hair and blue eyes. she was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. She was the first girl I was ever into, and soon, my first and only love.

I worked up the courage to talk to this girl. I saw her drawing on the concrete with chalk. I walked up to her and asked to join. she nodded. So we drew. We drew for hours without saying a word. we laughed and drew and the world around us disappeared as I made a friend. That was the first day I met Lauren. We were best friends for 4 years.

When I was 11, My parents informed me that we had to move. We were moving 3 hours away and I instantly realized that I might be losing my best friend. I talked to Lauren the next day. She listened and nodded. She then blurted out: ""wanna sleepover and watch a movie?"" I looked at her confused. She obviously didn't understand. I told her I am [REDACTED_NAME] away and We wouldn't see each other anymore. Lauren smiled and said, ""Yeah, but you're here now. wanna watch a movie?"" And so we watched a movie and shared a sleeping bag on her floor. She was so warm under the covers. we held each other. I felt her heart beating. We were as one. I looked her in the eyes. I saw my future. I saw love. That was the first and only time we kissed. We lied there through the entire night without sleeping, just holding each other. She whispered, "" I don't want you to leave."" I nodded and started to cry, "" I don't want to go. I'll miss you too much."" Lauren wiped a tear and said, "" are we ever going to see eachother again?"" I nodded. ""We will see each other again."" she smiled and fell asleep. I watched her sleep. ""I promise""

At this point, you are probably wondering what this has to do with killing the love of my life. Well I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to that. the thing is, That was the last time I saw Lauren in person. but it was enough to fall in love. I felt that love burning inside me ever since we were drawing with chalk. One day, I, a 19 year old college student, was on facebook, and decided to try to find her, and sure enough, I saw her. Her blue eyes. she hasn't changed. she was as beautiful as I had remembered. I messaged her. 

We started messaging each other and we quickly picked up where we left off. I found out she lived a few towns over and we decided to meet up for a date. I was very excited. We decided on a quiet park we used to go to when we were kids. I was going to pick her up, but she said she wanted the first time seeing me for years to be in a beautiful place, not my car. so I agreed. I waited at the park. we agreed on 7:30. It was 6:30 at the time, and I had gotten there early because I was so excited. I sat there imagining what my future would hold having lauren back into my life. I imagined what our kids would look like. I imagined holding her in my arms. I imagined kissing her. I heard sirens off in the distance.

It was 7:30 I waited.

8:00 I was impatient 

8:30 I was frustrated. 

9:00 I was worried. I called her on her phone but there was no answer. 

9:30 I decided to go home. I was depressed on the ride home, as I listened to the news. There was a car accident on a road in the town I was in. 1 female was in critical condition. I didn't think anything of it. I got home around 10:00 I lied in my bed, disappointed. That was when it hit me. I got on my phone and googled information about the crash. 1 woman was in shock trauma after the crash and in bad condition. I found out the next morning, after a sleepless night, that that woman, had died. I found out her name was Lauren. 

I have been depressed for the following 3 years. I didn't tell anyone, because I didn't want any sympathy. None of my closest friends know of her existence, and my parents still remember a young girl I had a crush on, but they don't know that that young girl is now dead because I contacted her years later. If I never have contacted her, she would be alive. If I had driven her, she would have been alive. I killed Lauren",482,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
176qpx3,1697172517,10/13/2023 4:48,stories,I (30M) hit my father (51M) for a past mistake.,"Disposable account

  
I am [REDACTED_NAME] Peru, from a provincial city, when I was 18 years old my cousin, who is the same age as mine, accused me of having raped her, she and I were very close since we were children since we used to spend time together, due to family problems she began to have depression.

&#x200B;

It wasn't like before, now all she did was scream, get angry or even blame me because I didn't have the same problems as her, the truth is I was trying to help her, but my own mental health was beginning to deteriorate so I decided little by little to move away. Months passed and I had no contact with her until one day my father came to my house and called me, I went out to meet him and he received me with a slap in the face, it should be noted that my father had never hit me before, who did that was my mother and only for specific reasons.

&#x200B;

When I ask him about the reason behind the hit, he slapped me again and told me to get out of the house, that his brother (my cousin's father) had told him that my cousin said that I raped her and that's why she was so depressed, apparently her dad realized that she was cutting herself and to get out of it she just blamed me for everything, my cousin didn't press charges (Obviously because there is no proof) but still my dad told me that my uncle wanted to beat me up, my dad was disappointed in me, he hit me again, called me an abuser, insulted me and told me to get out of his house, my mom was always a submissive person with him so she didn't say anything to him, I simply with my lip bleeding grabbed my most valuable things and left, thank God I had my savings on my card from what I had worked for and I was able to go to the capital by public transportation.

&#x200B;

 Once in the capital I managed to rent a small room, I had a bad time for the next few years, I had a couple or two for a few years and jumping from job to job to survive. When I was 20 years old, my partner at that time told me that I could work at the KFC where she worked as a delivery order receptionist. The part-time job paid well and with the bonuses you could even earn double or triple my salary, so I worked there doing the best I could while studying a technical degree in administration.

&#x200B;

Years passed and I ended up becoming a supervisor and then manager of that store thanks to my technical degree in business administration. At the age of 25 I became a partner with a former university classmate with whom I still had contact (She is a lawyer) and the age of 27 we got married, it was a small wedding because both she and I are modest with expenses and because I had no family to invite, we currently have a one-year-old son whom I love with all my soul.

&#x200B;

It was after this that everything went to hell, today in the middle of the afternoon there was a knock at my door, it was my parents, it had been more than a decade since I had seen them, I was frozen but not with fear, but with anger, my dad asked me if he could come in, I told him no, so we talked in a nearby park, in short, they told me that my cousin had committed suicide and that in her letter she confessed the whole truth, that the person who actually abused her was her mother's brother and that everything was orchestrated by him to be able to cover up and other things, the truth is I was very indifferent, for me whoever accuses of those crimes deserves to suffer them in flesh, so I didn't feel sorry for her, I told them kindly (and resisting my urge to yell at them) to go away and never contact me again, that they were dead to me.

&#x200B;

When I stood up from the bench to go home my dad grabbed me by the shoulder, he told me that we have to keep talking, I told him no, he insisted, I told him no, he insisted again, so I turned around and instinctively gave him a hit, I don't know when my dad became so weak, any latino knows that country men are quite strong, but one hit was enough to break his nose, he stood stunned looking at me with his eyes open and his nose bleeding and my Mom was covering her mouth, for some reason that I don't explain, my next reaction was to throw myself at him, it wasn't difficult to knock him to the ground and I continued hitting him, when he started to cover his face I started hitting his head or forehead, I'll not lie, it felt liberating, I felt like I was crying while I hit him and I continued until my right hand was hurting.

&#x200B;

My mother stood still, for some reason she didn't do anything, she just stood there watching and crying, by that time it was already night and in our area it was difficult to find people on the street, even less so considering that today there is a soccer game, my Mom helped my dad and took a taxi, she didn't say anything to me, she didn't scream, she just cried and as soon as she grabbed my dad she ran away, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] lying, if she had tried to intervene maybe she would have gotten the same treatment.

&#x200B;

A few hours later my mother writes to me on my cell phone, apparently they contacted a friend from university (I still have my social networks active) who told them where I lived, saying that my father needs a septum reconstruction because it was perforated and dental reconstruction For having 4 broken teeth, everything was going to cost the equivalent of 4k USD, which is a lor of money here, not a fortune but it’s a lot. 

&#x200B;

I have already been clear with her, I am [REDACTED_NAME] going to put in a single cent, for my sake she and my dad could end up just like my cousin, I don't care, she has been calling me, asking for forgiveness for everything, that she wants to come back into my life , that she was afraid and that she should have protected me or at least believed me, according to her my dad felt the same and according to him he deserves every hit I gave him, I guess we agree on that.

&#x200B;

I told my wife everything, she already knew what happened in the past with my parents, she just told me that she understood, that, according to what I told her, my father died when he kicked me out of his house, so who did I hit was just a stranger with his face, I found her comparison funny and I agreed with her, she told me that if they tried legal measures we would simply say that it was in self-defense, a law was recently passed in which lethal force can even be used when It's about self-defense, so if something happens to him we can rely on that, right now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I have a lawyer wife, I can't help but feel more liberated after this, my parents aren't poor so I know they'll get the money for the operation, I hope they just aren't idiots enough to come back to my house, this is my home now and if I have to beat them both to get the hell out of my life, I will, at the end of the day, they are the ones who started all this, I was just defending myself.

&#x200B;

I still feel a little euphoric and happy, the truth is, I am a little happy that they are suffering, they deserve it, I am [REDACTED_NAME] with my life and my family, and I would protect them at any cost, that includes my parents. I needed to get this off my chest somehow so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this to release it, somehow telling it all has made me feel better.

16piw5d,1695410469,9/22/2023 19:21,stories,Four days ago my coworker who's also my friend fell down the stairs and died in front of me,"Four days ago I was walking with a coworker on a break just to stretch our legs. We work in an office setting so like to get up every once in a while and get some fresh air. We walk in a half circle around the building. In the back there are stairs that we like to go down and then back up on our way back for exercise. It's two sets of [REDACTED_ADDRESS]eps.

It was a beautiful sunny day with blue skies. Near the top of the stairs we were in mid-conversation while heading down and all of a sudden I hear him go ""Oh god"" and trip and fall somehow. He rolled down and landed at the bottom in a heap, face first in the concrete. I just stared for a few seconds because it was so sudden. I ran to the bottom while asking if he's ok, but he didn't move or respond. I got close and realized there was blood coming from his head and face and his arms and legs were seized up and stiff when I tried to roll him over.

I freaked out but managed to call 911 while also texting another coworker friend of mine to come outside the office because our friend fell. 911 told me to roll him over and do CPR while they came, which I did.

The ambulance got there about 7 minutes after I called and took him to the hospital, but I'm 99% sure he was already dead when I was doing CPR

I feel really weird about it. Like sad, but also just strange. It's hard to put into words. It doesn't seem real. I will get flashes where I realize what happened and feel an intense tightness in my chest and the severity of it hits me. I keep imagining him laying at the bottom of the stairs face down, and also his torn up face when I was giving him CPR when he was already dead. It's also just really sad because he was one of my best friends at work. I've barely slept since Tuesday, and was full of adrenaline for a full day after it happened.

He was single with no kids or anything. Only has a brother and father who live in other states.

I don't really know why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] all this but I just feel really strange and am wondering if anyone ever experienced something like this.

EDIT: Didn't expect this post to get so much traction. I appreciate all the advice and positive thoughts sent my way. It saddens me that many of you have similar experiences. I can't respond to every comment but I am [REDACTED_NAME] every single one. Thank you!",10437,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1fo37so,1727148407,9/24/2024 3:26,confession,Was molested at 6 flags when I was 12... and it haunts me. ,"I went to six Flags (great America) on an 7th grade class trip.

Away from my group of friends,  I wanted to ride the Batman ride when they went to lunch. As I stood in line - and this is burned into my brain - a big harley/  biker guy and his skinny woman kept making out behind me. She had no bra on, but did have a black tank top shirt. It made me uncomfortable,  but I was more interested in the ride.... and looking forward. 

At one point,  I was going up the stairs & she ran her hand up the inside of my leg and grabbed my ass, trying to cup my balls. I jumped& said wtf. He said ""like what you see?"" and grabbed her boobs from behind. They laughed ... and laughed... and I was mortified.

.... as I grew up I kept thinking,  why didn't I ask to see hers? Why didn't I ask if I could turn the favor?  She was hot! 

Why was I so uncomfortable? 

Then I realize:  I was molested by some random perv. There is no justification or response.

Cause when I was younger I ate so much weird stuff like ketchup and bread, raw rice, powered coffee satches ,very salty rice, raw spaghetti and soaked raw rice. Like I had the most unhinged plate when I was younger. I was so sneaky with everything too like no one in my family knew about it as well cause I used to not get caught all the time.


 And the thing is I used to waste actual food that was given to me but when it came to a bit of Maggi cube I ate it a bit. And my obsession with raw rice needed to be studied because I never knew how much I kept eating. AND I WASNT SICK SOMEHOW. I even ate expired cheese without knowing it was expired and even last year I ate some cappuccino coffee packets. I am [REDACTED_NAME] curious to see who had a weirder food choice than me 


Edit: I forgot I also ate melted cheese, used to chew on toilet paper, frozen berries, frozen prawns, frozen seafood packets and I might even edit if I still remember more

bu7zqr,1559090473,5/29/2019 0:41,offmychest,15F Is this sexual abuse? My story.,"When I was 9 I had a friend that I would go to church(awana) with he was 12 and his family were family friends. 

I would go over his house all the time after school or church and we would just hangout and watch his brothers... sometimes. 

It all started as him showing me prom videos that I didn’t really understand or care about then it progressed to him forcing me to sit on his lap while he touched me under my underwear while watching henti. And that’s how things between me and him where. Him touching me and showing me porn. Once he told his friend about how cool it was to dry hump me(I didn’t know that’s what it was at the time) this wasn’t very forced though. I did say no but eventually gave in. And they did that for maybe 30 minutes. I remember the only reason it stopped was because my grandpa came to look for me at there house. He saw me in the position and said nothing. 

Eventually the boy moved and we lost communication 
 (End of the story with him) 
..................................................................

After I had experienced things with him someone on Omegle told me about “body swapping” to this day I do not know what his true intention was. He gave me the account information of this girl I’ll call Hailey and gave me some picture of her and nudes of her. He told me to communicate with people in her life and basically live as this girl. He told me to send pictures of myself so he could see from my “POV” so I did. I asked him if I was supposed to wear clothes and he said no. As this girl I talked to a lot of guys and shared her nudes with them whenever they’d ask. Once I ran out of pics to send them I asked the guy what to do and he said I could say no. And that was the FIRST time I realized that I could say no to things. So I said no to the guy that thought I was Hailey. 
(I’m sooo sorry Hailey) 

..................................................................
(Still 9 or 10) 


I had kik and I would go on a extension of the sight where you could find people to talk to I met MANY MANY guys and they all wanted nudes so I sent them. I also had Omegle and I repeated the same process. If I did not send pictures id hate myself. 

Everntually I started saying no to sending pictures a lot and the men would guilt trip me into doing this I thought that if I didn’t send photos these men would kill themseleves 
But then it progressed to something more. 
Men would ask for pictures and If I didn’t send them I’d seee demons all over my room screaming at me for being a horrible person. 

sending nudes to men stopped for me when I was almost 11 because my sister found a nude on my iPad and took it away.(thankfully)


(I’d like to clarify the reason I sent pics in the first place is because I thought I had no other option) 


....................................................................

Like I said before i felt like I had to send nudes to men but at that age I felt like I had to do a lot of things like: cut my tongue off or break my bones. 
( I tried to break my bones many times by throwing myself off play structure) 
I believe I met have had some type of childhood ocd that I don’t have any more. 

Although. My ex boyfriend who has severe  ocd thinks I do because of some of the things I do now but I highly doubt it. But I am a perfectionist. 

.............,..................................................... 
 
At age 12 I started self harming heavily I self harmed everyday and I’d cry everyday before school because I was terrified of stepping into the building. Sometimes I couldn’t even leave my house out of fear that someone would kill me. I had severe anxiety (at the time I thought I may have anxiety and talked to my grandma about this and she said I was to young to have anxiety and I agreed with her) but now I know that i definitely did. 

I became homeschooled because going to school was way to hard and I stayed homeschooled until the last semester of 7th grade. 

In 8th grade I never ate lunch although I would buy it every single day I just never wanted to eat. 
In the summer before 9th grade I joined the varsity  cheer team and got a concussion during cheer camp (I’m a flyer and fell out of a stunt)(extra background info I started cheering when I was 8) a week after cheer camp I tried to kill myself and was sent to a psych ward for a month

While I was in the psych ward I didn’t eat for 2 weeks so they started making me drink boost because I lost A LOT of weight. Whenever I’d have boost I’d get the urge to purge. (I had tried to back in 8th grade but couldn’t) then I started feeling like I absolutely had to purge so I did i don’t have much of a gag reflux so I’d have to keep my hands in my mouth for about 30 seconds moving then around and stabbing this tongue like thing in the back of my throat. 

At this point I purged everytime I had a boost and they found out and I was diagnosed with bulimia and about a week later they change my diagnosis to anorexia nervosa due to how underweight I was. Whenever I’d eat I’d find something to cut myself with and one time I was so upset I cut myself 101 times because that was my highest weight (I was using blunt plastic objects) 

After a month in the psych ward they send me home because my insurance gave out 5 days later I tried to kms again and got sent to a different psych ward for a month but that month was interrupted due to the fact I refused to eat and was sent to get force fed threw a tube. Once I went back to the psych ward I got send to a residential treatment. After I got out I was sent to partial hospitalization for 2 months and met some amazing people while restoring weight. 

Now I’m about to finsh freshman year with a trash gpa and I’m ready to share my story with the internet (still refuse to tell my therapist) 

Anyway I want opinions on my sexual childhood and how to deal with it. I also want to find someone that can relate to me.",2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1jogsll,1743461879,3/31/2025 22:57,stories,I worked security at the hotel where one of the biggest musical artists in the world stayed and it was interesting to see how that works.,"I occasionally do weekend security work at one of the swankiest hotels in my city and sometimes big names stay there while they are in town. 

I won't name the celebrity but I will just call her Amy. The one thing that really stood out to me was how every single one of her movements was planned and choreographed. Like I said she is one of the biggest musical artists in the world right now and she would no doubt get swarmed if she walked through a public area and people realized it was her, so shielding her from the public was the number one priority.

All of the hotel staff had a pre-shift meeting with her security team. There was some basic guidelines such as do not speak to her unless spoken to, do not let any guests know she is staying here, do not ask for a picture or an autograph, and let them take the lead. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] all of the security members on her team were carrying weapons of some kind but they were all wearing jackets and I didn't see any firearms on them.

She was driven from the airport to our hotel in a SUV with blacked out windows, and she came in through the loading dock. My only job at that moment was to stand in front of a door leading to the maintenance area to ensure that nobody tried to get through. Like I said, anytime she was moving, it was highly coordinated and choreographed. Everybody had their place and there was nobody in the area that was not part of the team. She did not look at anybody or say anything, she just sauntered in looking kind of miserable TBH.

She was brought up in the freight elevator, and there was members of her security team on every floor in front of the freight elevator to make sure nobody got on while she was still in it. She had a room on the top floor, and that entire floor as well as the floor below it were completely bought out by her and her team.

Guests can only go to the floor that they are staying on by way of swiping their room cards, there were members of her security team posted by the elevators all night just in case somebody somehow snuck onto that floor.

What I got out of the experience was being thankful that I can walk around like a normal person and nobody gives a fuck. I feel like having to be consistently hidden from you and the restrictions that come with that would be pretty miserable.",1944,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2b7g6r,1405860847,7/20/2014 12:54,offmychest,I had sort of a 'relationship' with a 28 years old man when I was around 15 and now at 19 I still don't know how I feel about it (Please help?),"Ok so I’m a 19 years old girl and this happened when I was 15/16 so around three years ago. I’ve never told anyone and I feel like I’m never gonna be completely over it until I get it off my chest. I lurk this subreddit pretty often so I thought it’d be appropriate to write my story and post it. 


This is reeeally long, so if you read the whole thing, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Also I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for any mistakes, English is not my first language.  


I was a really shy and quiet child that enjoyed being alone, always reading, and didn’t make friends easily. I was bullied pretty badly at school and my self-esteem was terrible. I used to sit and hang out with a big group of girls but only after the teachers saw me alone all the time and talked to them and convinced them to become my “friends”. They were nice enough, but I didn’t even liked them because we had nothing in common. That went on for two years before I just couldn’t bear it and started sitting alone again and stopped talking to them (I’d be nice if they tried to talk to me but it was clear that I wanted to be left alone and they didn’t care that much anyway), so I spent the next year alone, reading all the time. It was a little lonely, but nice. Then I started making friends with some of the more “alternative” crowd, so to speak. Me and another girl started to sit with these two guys, an (both self-proclaimed) anarchist and a fascist/neo-nazi who were best friends. Yeah, I know. We had some lively arguments. 


Then I went to another high school and lost contact with all of them. I was very lonely, and this was when I met the man that this post is about on Facebook. I commented on a post by a younger girl I knew (I think it was a pic of her new bunny or something cute like that?) and he commented too and started talking to me. He soon sent me a private message and we kept talking. We seemed to have an unbelievable amount of things in common. Our favourite author was the same, and it was one that wasn’t popular at all in my country, he was actually the first person that I met that had read his books too. It was amazing. He asked me for my email to keep talking and I gave it to him without hesitation. In no time at all he sent me a really long email and I responded in the same way, starting an email conversation that lasted a couple of weeks. The emails were extremely long and we usually exchanged one each day, if not more. He was extremely friendly and made me feel really great. We talked about everything, and he complimented me a lot, but not in an inappropriate way. We kept discovering things we had in common - We were both atheists (I was surrounded by really religious people and this was amazing to me), we both loved the English language (he had actually lived in England for a few years, which I was enchanted by, since it had been a dream of mine for a very long time… off topic but I’m currently living there whooo) and much more… We exchanged pictures, and he said I was very beautiful. No one had said that about me before. When we talked about our ages he kept saying how ‘age is just a number’ and talking about how mature I was and stuff like that, but also said that if I wasn’t comfortable being friends with an adult man like him he’d understand and stop talking to me. He was 28. I of course said I didn’t care and that I didn’t want to stop talking to him. Then we kept getting closer. I told him about how I never wanted to have kids and didn’t believe in marriage and all that and he said that he didn’t believe in soulmates but if he did he would think that I was his soulmate. Of course, I was extremely flattered.


For this couple of weeks all I could think about was our emails, literally all the time. I was consumed by it. I didn’t pay attention at school, I went to the laptop straight away when I got home and I spent hours crafting my reply to his latest email and then anxiously waiting for him to respond. I went to bed late and slept little. 


He lived in my same city, so of course soon we started to talk about meeting up in person. Finally we decided to go to the cinema together. Basically I was a fucking idiot and didn’t think about my safety even once. At least I got the ‘meeting in a public place’ part right, but I knew that my parents wouldn’t let me meet up with someone like him in a million years (they didn’t know about him obviously) so I lied and said that I was going to go to the cinema with some girls from school. I was really lucky that nothing went wrong, but if something had happened to me my family wouldn’t even know, I’d have just disappeared. I regret taking such a risk - If you’re meeting someone from the internet, remember to be safe! Tell a friend or something! 


Anyway, I tried to make myself look pretty and went to meet him. He hugged me tight at soon as he saw me and I laughed a little awkwardly because I was terribly nervous (almost shaking, really) and we went to see our movie, Sucker Punch. After that, we went for a walk and then into a coffee shop. He gave me a present, a really nice edition of the Sin City movie, that we both loved. I was so incredibly happy and thanked him profusely. We didn’t talk much because I was (and still am) very awkward and find difficult to keep conversations going. But he said he didn’t care. He gave me a very long hug when we said goodbye (as he always did every time after that, also when we said hello) and as soon as I got home I saw that I already had an email from him telling me that he missed me.


We started seeing each other at least once a week. I guess it never really was a relationship, not properly, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] from an outside perspective we looked like a couple. He taught me to play Magic The Gathering and gave me one of his old decks. I didn’t want to accept it because it was rare and valuable but he put it in my bag when I wasn’t looking and I discovered when I got home. We lent each other books (I got him to read the hunger games, which he told me he loved, he got me to read ender’s game which honestly i didn’t like at all). He also bought some books that he knew I wanted to read for me, he paid for coffee and other small stuff when we went out, and gave me a few more gifts… to the point where I started to be uncomfortable with it. I tried to reject them most times and pay for myself when I could, but I was (still am, kind of, but got much better) very bad at communicating how I feel, specifically negative emotions, and I didn’t want to seem ungrateful. 


By now I was going out a lot more often than I had a few months before, and of course my parents noticed and wanted to know who I was hanging out with. I told them a little about him but just enough so they wouldn’t worry, and lied saying that he was only a couple years older than me. My mother never saw him, my father only once, when he came to pick me up from a park we had been walking around in after it started storming really bad. The rain was heavy and he couldn’t see him clearly from inside the car, and we left immediately. 


Sometimes when we met at the center of the city he went with me on the bus back home and then walked back to his own house, which was almost an hour away on foot. I told him he didn’t need to do that but he said he wanted to make sure I was safe. He was really big on the ‘being a gentleman’ thing. He held doors open for me, always walked on the side that was closer to the road and sometimes even grabbed my arm/waist to move me out of the way or held my hand to cross the street and stuff like that. He held my hand a lot when we were walking anywhere. He called me pretty or beautiful *a lot* (also said stuff like ‘you’re not like other girls’ and other things that today would seem kinda sexist to me /: ) and stuff like princess, etc. When we were sitting in a bench he always got very close to me and tried to cuddle me and sometimes touch my face and kissed my hand a lot. To his credit he told me that if I was uncomfortable I only had to tell him to stop, but as I said before, I had trouble communicating stuff and I found that impossible even when I did have a problem with it. I think I was visibly uncomfortable sometimes though, but maybe he never realized. He claimed to be very awkward and bad at social interaction, just like me. 


A few times he surprised me by waiting for me at the door of my high school to see me when I got out of my classes, he walked me home (around 10 minutes) and then he’d go back to his house by bike. Some people in my class even asked me if he was my father. I said no, just a friend, and that was it. 


At that time I was the admin of a forum for young writers (we had a couple of boys but mostly it was teenage girls) and because he also liked to write, I let him join. I regret this decision a lot. He was nice and polite to everyone but he clearly didn’t belong to that kind of space. He posted some of his stories, a couple of which had some strong sexual content, and only asked if that kind of thing was ok after posting. Before that we only had only had one other writer that wrote some mild slash/yaoi from time to time, but I said sure, we were ok with it. 


He worked on a video store, and had studied something related to filmmaking. He said that he really liked one of my stories that I posted on the forum and talked a lot about turning it into a short film. I was excited but wary, and honestly now I think it was bullshit. He made a few claims that were pretty unbelievable from time to time, like that he was a master at karate and had worked as a bodyguard for a few years, but he was quite skinny and honestly didn't look very strong.


One day he took me to his house to show me something. He still lived with his parents in a pretty big house on the old part of the city. His room was full of anime posters and figurines. There were soda cans everywhere too. He explained that it wasn’t normally like that and that he was saving them for a ‘project.’ Then he took me to a storage room they had and showed me some katanas he had. Honestly it was all really weird, and I started to be seriously uncomfortable around him. 


We met up again and I felt gross and disgusted every time he touched me. After less than an hour where I was really cold towards him he asked me if I was ok and I said that I hadn’t slept much that night (I had serious problems with sleep and he knew this, but it was just an excuse) and that I wanted to go home. I insisted on taking the bus alone. By then I believe he knew something wasn’t right, and tried to talk to me about it by email, but I wouldn’t admit anything was wrong. I just couldn’t stand his presence anymore. I was totally repulsed by his smell, his voice, how he treated me, everything that I once liked. I didn’t want to see him anymore but I still had one book of his, so I told him to come to my house one afternoon my parents weren’t there, so I could return it. Once he was there he tried to make me keep the book and give me another one, maybe so we’d have to see each other again, but I didn’t want to and refused it. I told him he had to go because my parents were coming back, but in reality they were gone until the next day, I just was very anxious and wanted him gone. He asked me if I was angry at him or something and I said I wasn’t. I let him hug me for a second before pulling away and closing the door on him, and that was the last time I saw him. 


He sent me a few emails after that but I never read them. I sent him one a few days later saying that my parents didn’t want me to talk to him anymore because I needed to focus on studying. Just a bunch of excuses that I hoped were convincing enough so he’d leave me alone. I then made a filter so any emails of his went directly to the bin, I deleted all the emails we had exchanged, I unfriended him on facebook and deleted his account on my forum and all his stories and comments, etc. I just wanted him out of my life. 



I was quite anxious for a few weeks, but he never contacted me again. I just tried to go on with my life and not think about it. For the longest time I couldn’t think about the whole thing without feeling terrible, and I was so confused about it. Sometimes I even missed him, but I knew I had done the right thing, even if sometimes I couldn’t help but wonder if I was too harsh. He never tried to even kiss me and never made any overtly sexual advances (though I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and kinda oblivious to that sort of thing so I don't even knowl...), but looking back at it, his behaviour does seem kinda predatory to me. Maybe he was sincere, though immature, or maybe it was just a question of time until it escalated into something worse and I was lucky that I got out early. The whole thing was just maybe half a year I think? And the fact is that he helped my self-esteem a lot and introduced me to some stuff that I still love today, so I don’t quite feel like I could say that I was taken advantage of… But man, when I think about it now I just can’t think that it was healthy. I was just a kid! And I’m sure I looked like one too, I’ve always looked younger than I am. I still feel like I’m so young.


I guess I just really need someone’s else perspective to help me stop mulling over it, and sort out my feelings about the past so I can really move on with my life and forget it.

1leawtk,1750231408,6/18/2025 7:23,stories,Reconnected with my high school best friend after 20 years and I've never seen someone fall so far,"I grew up in a small town in Arizona where I met my soon to be best friend, Riley. His parents were also divorced but his family was pretty well off. His dad owned a restaurant in Phoenix and drove really nice vehicles and owned property in Mexico where the family went for vacation a few times a year. His mom worked at a casino at a black jack table and made crazy tips. I pretty much grew up at their house and she would come home at like 2am with a few hundred bucks in cash sometimes. 

Then there's my family. Both parents are alcoholics riding the poverty line. We didn't celebrate any holidays and our vacations were going to Arizona Mills in the valley to get new shoes and eat In and Out. My mom was a dispatcher and then later a housekeeper. My dad couldn't stop drinking and driving so he left the state to avoid prison time. 

Needless to say, Riley's house was awesome to me. I practically grew up there and in high school I started going with he and his dad's family to Mexico in spring and summer breaks. His dad's restaurant was so damn good. We'd pull up on our bikes and they'd just give us whatever we wanted. It honestly, to me, seemed like Riley had it all. He was going to inherit the restaurant, his dad bought him his first car and told him he'd buy him his first house. I won't lie, I did feel jealous sometimes.

Then at the end of high school my family moved away and just like that it's like all my time with Riley was a dream. Never heard from or saw him again. It wasn't surprising as towards the end of high school he made other friends and stopped hanging out with me almost entirely.

I wish I could say my life got better but I was about to find out everything the hard way. I got kicked out at 18, reconnected with my father and it turns out he's a bad guy. I was homeless for 6 months. Moved back to my mother's and not too long after I was homeless living in the basement of a bar. I sometimes would think about Riley. I thought that he's helping running the family restaurant, probably has a stable living situation. Maybe a wife and kids? Who knows but i knew I wasn't doing well. I was depressed and attempted to end my life on more than one occasion, as most recently as 5 years ago. 

4 years ago I moved back to Arizona. My life slowly improved. I have a really good job, friends, an amazing girlfriend that I can't imagine life without. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] educated about finances and mental health. I feel really good and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of what I've done to get to this better place. 

A few months ago my brother texts me and says that he ran into Riley by complete chance at a truck stop outside of Phoenix. He gave him my number and said Riley would love to reconnect. Soon he and I were texting and made plans to meet. 

A few weeks ago I met him at a bar and I was surprised to see how he almost hasn't changed his appearance since school. Then we start catching up and over the course of the night I learn that it's as if we swapped lives. After high school he started growing weed and got caught trying to sell it. He spent a year in jail for that. He got on probation and immediately started growing and selling again and got caught again and spent a few more years behind bars. He missed his sister's wedding and his father refused to speak to him until he was diagnosed with cancer, which he succumbed to in 2015, while Riley was in prison. He said it emotionally destroyed him. 

His sister ran the family restaurant and he now runs it with her but COVID did a number to their business and he had to pick up another job to avoid losing the business. He developed a gambling problem and lost his first house and second house and still owes an obscene amount of money from that. His mother died in 2022 from cancer and then his grandmother recently. 

A few things I picked up that night was that he has a drinking problem. He says he can't fall asleep without it. That made me move us away from the bar and we just kinda walked around downtown Phoenix and continued our conversation over food. He was also oddly surprised that I was doing better than he thought I was. I almost think that he only wanted to hang out thinking my life was still such a mess so he could feel better about his. He's basically living on the edge of bankruptcy and the only family he really has left is his sister and he's burned her so much that she keeps him at arms length. And I understand where she's coming from. From my perspective this guy had a future set up and he pissed all over it.

So that's my story. It wasn't the happy reunion I was low-key expecting and feel awful for him. But, like he admitted to me, it stems from his poor choices. I've also decided to not pursue a rekindled friendship with him. At the end of the day he and I are wildly different people than we were 20 years ago. I don't think there's anything there and I hope him the best. I really, truly hope he gets his shit together.",2145,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1fmfxl4,1726961636,9/21/2024 23:33,offmychest,It took me 24 years to realize I was kidnapped ,"As a young child I trusted my mom. Fully. I believed everything she said. After all, she’s my mom. She wants what’s best for me. She loves me more than anyone in the world. 
I never thought this innocent and natural perception would be exploited to the degree it was. 

On my 3rd birthday my father stood waiting for me outside a McDonald’s. He had planned my birthday. A party I never attended. He waited and waited, called and called but she never showed up. Meanwhile, she was getting on a greyhound with me. The passengers learned it was my birthday, I imagined that she probably told them she was escaping an evil man. One passenger bought me a small birthday cake at one of the stops (my mom said). I wonder where that person is. If only they knew I was being kidnapped, and it wasn’t a happy day to celebrate but a day that would change my entire coarse of my life. 

Once we arrived on the other side of the country she entered into DV programs and changed both my name and SSN. Then she began to fill my developing and innocent mind with her grandiose lies. At 3.5 years she told me she **saved me** from my father. That he was an evil man who was physically and emotionally abusive. She told me he molested me. And if I ever met him that he would **kill her** and take me to Africa where my family would rape me.

 By this time my infantile amnesia had kicked it and I forgot everything up before this point. I forgot my dad. I forgot what he looked like. I forgot our bond. I forgot that I was a daddies girl. I forgot that I couldn’t sleep without him. Yet, even though I had forgotten him there was an intuition that led me to begin to becoming VERY misbehaved purposely toward my mother. I felt rage towards her but I didn’t know why.  That’s when the physical punishments began. Daily spankings. Biting. Fingers being bent back. Trauma symptoms kicked in. I began to wet the bed (something I didn’t do anymore even at this young age), night terrors about witches and running away became regular by 5 years old. Then the hallucination I saw of a demon telling me to kill myself. I gathered knives under my bed not fully knowing why but knowing I should listen to this presence in my room. How does a baby already want to die? It was because I was dying. Then, I was dead. 

My old self with my old name was gone. And instead in its place was a traumatized and angry shell of a child. Not knowing the old me would remain a member of the cast in my mind forever. Screaming to be let out. To be free. To be allowed to be me. I hated the person she forced me to be. I hated myself. 

My mom met her new husband and told me to call him dad. I did for a few days and something felt wrong. I stopped and for the rest of my life she would refer to him as “your dad.” She pressured me to take his last name. She told him I was so misbehaved because she didn’t punish me cause she felt bad I didn’t have my dad. When the reality was I was punished so often I grew to see her as an enemy worth fighting. Once he arrived in my life the physical punishments became less frequent and he became the one to punish me. Much more level headed, he would normally ground me. I would often take my frustration out on him saying “Your not my dad!” 

Time passed and I did petty things. Like stealing makeup which earned me a year long grounding. Eventually everything was removed from me. My phone, TV and computer and any devices and I was told I can have them back when I buy my own. Realizing I had no positive reinforcement to behave anymore by my teens I had basically “defeated” my mom’s punishments. Going out and not coming home for days. Drinking. Having sex. My mom wasn’t interested in my life. She only shamed me for my deplorable actions. Regularly calling the cops on me for petty things like drinking and smoking. Time after time I would feel the suicidal rage come back, I would think to myself “I just want my dad” not knowing who I was even wanting. Not knowing that these were forms of covert abuse masked as discipline. 

I became the “problem child” she would gossip about to anyone who would listen, telling them how mentally ill I am [REDACTED_NAME] how hard it is as my mother. In trouble again and again, “How could you after everything I’ve done for you? I risked my life to keep you safe. You’re a psychopath just like your dad. Soon you’ll be 18 and you need to find somewhere else to live because I’m moving across the state.” 18 creeped up and I felt the fear of abandonment coming I knew I had to do something or I would be in the street. The day after my birthday I was kidnapped by a stranger on Craigslist claiming to have a room share. He raped me. Come to find out, he was a serial rapist and there were others. While the court process began I found a roommate a friend from high school. My mom step dad and little brother were gone, they rarely called. 

I felt safe to start to look for my dad. I found him on Facebook and messaged him. This is where the suspicion began. He told me he has been looking for me. That he loved me and was hurt every time my birthday came around. He was so hurt that he told people I died because he couldn’t explain my mom took me every time someone asked where I was. He was shocked when I asked him about her allegations of rape. His wife and new daughters defended him saying your mom is absolutely lying. 

He bought a ticket for me and my bestfriend so I wouldn’t feel alone. Meeting him was a beautiful memory filled with happy tears. But the suicidal rage, bad behavior became too much for him and he got me a ticket back home writing me off as being “like my mom”. 

No one was with me in court when I faced my rapist. **NO ONE** . He got 56 years the only justice I ever had. (Someone told me I should include his name as proof, I don’t feel obligated to prove my story is true that’s not why I shared it I literally just wanted to get it off my chest but just for the heck of it and because I love exposing abusers and rapists his name is Jose Omar Ortiz in OR if you want to read the news article.) 

 2 years passed before we both apologized to eachother. He told me that was his biggest mistake and he would forever be sorry. A apology? Very weird. My mom had never apologized to me for anything. I felt so seen and validated. Our relationship remained distant but he was supportive. Helping me many times I was in a financial crisis or abusive relationship. My mom was never willing to help me. I learned to not ask for help or tell her about my problems. 

The opposition of their conflicting stories created cognitive dissonance that I couldn’t settle. It drove me crazy not knowing who the crazy person is. It has to be at least one of them, someone is lying. But I made excuses for my mom and wondered if maybe she was right and my dad had fooled me. I was scared to confront her I didn’t want to victim blame sold I was wrong. Because if I was wrong that meant she was abused and a victim herself. I had no memory so how can I tell? 

But their behaviors told a story I couldn’t ignore. I never felt loved by my mom whereas my dad had empathy for me, he was interested in my life and helped me when I needed him. Qualities my mom ALL lacked. My boyfriend told me it’s obvious who is wrong. The more I studied her behavior I seen consistent manipulation patterns: victim mentality, guilt tripping, blame shifting and then love bombing. All classic narcissistic traits. 

It has been 9 years since I met my dad. Only a few days have passed since I realized my mom kidnapped me. She was the crazy one all along. She abused me psychologically, emotionally, physically and neglected me. That realization is so overwhelming that I feel nothing but emptiness. I can hardly cry. 

Why is this my life? A life she curated FOR ME. 

A few days ago I went no contact. I blocked her on everything. She barely speaks to me yet her response was to call everyone she knows I know and ask “why did she block me I can’t figure it out” as if my people are her resource for information. 

Now I’m looking into finding a lawyer. I’ve been educated that there is no statute of limitations for federally kidnapping children across state lines. Since it is between multiple states it would be an investigation by the FBI. I don’t want to punish her, I just want acknowledgment of her disregard for my life. 

I struggle mentally, I can’t focus. I have issues sleeping. I overthink and overcompensate. I have had an evil voice in my mind that tells me to kill myself as long as I can remember. At first I wanted to punish her and then it became because life is so unbearable. The confusion drove me mad until I finally realized. 

All I ever wanted is a family and a home. So I have no practical dreams or career aspirations. I just want love. I have to rebuild the person I was born to be. I hope to become someone who inspires others like me. 

She changed my name, took away my family, my culture, my identity. She killed me. I will never be who I was meant to be. But I know I am [REDACTED_NAME] a mentally ill troubled person but a person who was psychologically abused, who has empathy for others, who deserved a chance a peace. A chance she took from me. She took my true destiny and identity away from me. Something I will never get back. 
One filled with family, love and compassion. One where I would be validated and valued. One without abuse. 

She took all of that, she erased an essential part of me. But she can’t take my soul. I know the truth now and I know who I am. 

For those affected by parental alienation, kidnapping or narcissistic abuse … I know your pain. I’m with you. You aren’t alone. 

They can kill who we used to be…

***…but they can’t take our souls.***

I SA’d my brother (no penetration or anything like that, it was just genital to genital contact) and I feel so so fking disgusting. 

I know people here say that for child on child SA it’s maybe because the other child was SA’d themselves, though I’m not sure if I ever was…though I do remember an inappropriate moment with my moms boss, probably around that time if not a bit younger. I’m not trying to excuse what I did whatsoever, I promise you that.

hcta20,1592685277,6/20/2020 20:34,TrueOffMyChest,I was a victim.. and I only realized that 4 years later,"Really long story, so prepare for that.



I had an on/off boyfriend in high school. I was young, dumb, and severely depressed. I had no self-worth whatsoever and being with him made me feel like I was something you know? This was between ages 15-17. We started off as good friends, but during the relationship he would lie to me and be really vague about things. I pushed it off because yay I have a boyfriend who likes me when I absolutely hated myself, but I would always get warnings from other people about who he really was. I ignored them as they were his exes and I amounted it to jealousy at the time. 

Things were going alright, until he would always try to be sexual. I was never interested in anything like that as I was still a kid, and he wouldn't push it any further if I was uncomfortable. 

I was still a kid. This all occurring 15-17. He was a year older than me. 

As time went on, we were on/off because he would leave me for an ex, then leave that ex for another girl, then that girl for another girl etc. 

Couple years later when I was 17, I was friends with one of his exes. We always hung out all summer and she would tell me how he kind of expected things of her. He would try to push sensual things like making out with her ""it's okay, we're best friends though it's okay"" and told me how severely uncomfortable that made her. She said after he left she started crying. I went home and I just felt.. sick. I wasn't the only one he was trying to kind of push things on. It always made me feel really guilty for not being into anything  sexual. I started to feel even more worthless.. I couldn't offer anything and honestly that was made very clear. 

Fast forward to.. truthfully I don't know. I don't know ages anymore but I want to say I was 17 and him 18. Yeah. I was 17.


The summer after my Junior year.

We would hang out and he always wanted to be sexual while together and kinda pressured me into it. So I gave in because I thought that's what love was. No penetration just, feeling up. More on his end as I never really wanted to do this but I just wanted to keep him around because I thought I was in love.. 

Well, after one day he winds up changing his mind about us I guess and goes back to an ex days later. He gets her pregnant.. she's 14-15 at the time and him 18. 

Everyone pretty much hated him. Yet. I couldn't bring myself to. Even after everything he was doing to me I couldn't bring myself to hate him. I wanted to be that one person who didn't. 

This gets longer but I'll try to shorten it.

After my senior year and I was away at college, he and I were in contact again. He would tell me how stressful his relationship was and would always imply regretting having a child. I never knew what to say but I tried to be there for him. He then started to tell me that he loved me and wanted to be with me, that he regretted his decision to leave me. I was still in love, so. I put myself in this stupid decision of being his 'mistress' so to speak. He cheated on his girlfriend/mother of his child with me for MONTHS. This time I was 18 and it was sexual, I felt like it had to be to keep him. He was always assuring me he wanted to be with me and I believed him. Eventually we were found out, and I kept telling myself 'If I have to be the bad guy for him, so be it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with that. He loves me.' 

After I left that college and we were together.. it all changed.

Basically, the relationship went sour from there. 

After everything he told me, how he wanted to marry me, how he wanted us to be together forever while he was with her.. once he had me to himself, he treated me like shit. 

That relationship was always him lying to me, gaslighting me. He wanted her. He tried going back to her and would lie to me saying he wanted me. I didn't know what to do. I was so confused, so depressed, so heartbroken and still so in love. 

All I wanted was for him to tell me the truth. Did he ever love me? Why was he treating me like this when just months ago he wanted to marry me?

He would stalk her NSFW tumblr, still had nsfw pictures of her on his computer. It was clear. He was obsessed with her still. I was more heartbroken that he would lie to me than anything. 


As expected, that relationship ended. I don't remember that day. I used to. But my memory of that particular day is pretty much gone. I was 19? 20?


Months later I started talking to him again. More like, he came to me. Still wanting to keep me but needing it to be a secret because he went back to his ex/mother of his child. We did have sex again multiple times even though he was together again with her. It felt.. so wrong. But. Again. I did it because I wanted to keep him around.. I didnt care the relationship ended, I just wanted my best friend back.. but he stopped being that person long ago. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] one who broke that off. I knew it was a bad idea and knew he also didn't really love me. 



I ended up finding someone new. We've been together for nearly 4 years and are engaged. In the early stages of this relationship I was so scared and paranoid because of my past, but he was so gentle and loving with me. I learned what love really is and started to hate my ex for what he did to me. I held that hate for years, until recently. 

I thought I had forgiven him. We were all young and dumb and he did give me good memories. 


Then I started reading a lot of MeToo stories. And it all sounded.. familiar. 

Even though I always gave consent, I only did so because its what he had always wanted this entire time, because it's what would have kept him and because I felt pressure to.

I realized, why should I forgive him? When 1. He's never made any attempt to apologize 2. I was the victim. 

He lied to me, took advantage of me, used me, kept me around during his sick game when he didn't even know what he wanted. He kept me around because he was alone and I was the only one who didn't hate him. Or maybe because he'd known me for years he kept me around. What ever the reason, it was obvious he didn't love me. 


My name has been slandered because of what happened while I was away at college. Because he cheated even though i urged him to tell the truth for MONTHS because nobody deserves that. Yet I still did it anyway. 

My name has been slandered for being the bad guy. And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] denying that I was, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] denying what I did was wrong. 


But my side of the story has never been told.


After so many years I realized the truth, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME], so happy to finally get my story out. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] expecting anyone to really read this, I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Happy to get it out there",2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1l4lu8p,1749192413,6/6/2025 6:46,stories,I witnessed one of the saddest first dates when I was in Vegas,"This happened 10 years ago. I was visiting Vegas with a friend. We decided last minute to go to PF Chang's on a Friday night. It was slammed, we had to wait almost an hour to be seated and when we finally were we were placed in an area that had a long bench along a wall with multiple tables and chairs on the other side of those tables. 

I was sitting on the bench side next to a rather large person that was already eating and I was on the side of their arm they were using so I had to scoot further to my right. I was basically rubbing elbows with a very attractive and well dressed young woman. Opposite her was her date. A very nervous young man that was trying desperately to make conversation. They both had their food already and she hadn't even touched her plate and was looking at her phone. 

Her date either had a stutter or was so nervous he kept stammering and attempting to bring up anything only to be met with absolutely nothing but silence from her. Eventually I decide to kinda peer over at her phone right as she's ordering herself an Uber. She gets up without saying a word and leaves.

As she walked past him he asked if she was going to the restroom and she still says nothing. The hurt I saw in this man's eyes. I could tell he was hoping she was maybe going to the bathroom and would come back but as the minutes ticked by the embarrassment crept in, he looked around nervously for a server so he could pay and that's when I noticed he was fighting back tears. His face was red and his hands were shaking when he got his wallet out. As an observer it felt like a millennia for the server to come back with his card. He struggled to put his card in his wallet and eventually gave up just shoving both in his pocket and left.

I feel like i have to get this full story off of my chest as it's been weighing me down for months and i just want it out there so people know, I'll give you from the beginning to end so if you can't be bothered to read it all I understand. Small synopsis, met a girl abroad, fell in love she went back to australia, I went back to Uk, I ended up going to australia and things were never the same and now I've got huge regrets anxiety and maybe even depression plus suicidal thoughts. This post may not sound serious at first but bear with it because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] high on valium at the moment and without it I just end up beating myself up and wanting to hurt myself.

Last year I was working in a place called Lagos in Portugal after recently completing the Camino De Santiago ( a giant walk across France and Spain). I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the keen and eager traveler and love life a lot. We ended up hitchhiking down through Portugal to Lagos and I got work in a bar. Now Lagos is quite the party place and while there I ended up sleeping with quite a few girls however I met one called Lucy towards the end of my time there and things just clicked. She came to work at the bar for one trial shift, we ended up getting super wasted (drink and mdma) and went to a club afterwards. Upon leaving the club I was like ""do you want to come back to mine and smoke some weed?"" (I knew I didn't have any weed) and she was super up for it, so we went back bought a load of munchies on the way, skittles, mars bars you name it. Anyway we got back to mine still pretty drunk and I walk over to the draw where the weed was supposedly kept and turn around like ""oh shit, there's none here, jake must of smoked it.... what do we do now?"" with that look in my eyes like 'shall we have sex eyes'. Next thing you know we're having drunken wild sex, hardly remember anything and wake up next to her thinking holy jesus she's beautiful. She looked at me different to how any girls looked at me in my entire life and I found out further down the line that she actually fell in love with me that first day. We had sex quite a few times that day, there were condoms and skittles all around my room and she even put a finger up my bum at one point (she was the first girl I ever let do this, I didn't enjoy it but at the same time at least I can say I've tried it). Anyhow after a wild sex filled day we left the apartment at like 16:00 and I bought her breakfast then I had to go off to work and she had to go back to her hostel to sleep. I couldn't stop thinking about her after she left and messaged her quite a few times on facebook to come round that night. At this point I knew i liked her but at the same time, and not to sound like an arrogant douchebag but I had been sleeping with a lot of girls there and it was hard for me to develop feelings for her as I was still in the mindset it was just a holiday fling.

She messaged me back saying ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about it, it will be fun, but i'm [REDACTED_NAME]'s just rally now what I was expecting to happen...I don't mean that I wanted to come  over here and sleep with every guy that try's but I mean that I didn't expect to meet someone where things clicked"". 
Now this was a huge eye opener to me, i was 23 years old at the time and had never had a relationship or met a girl who properly liked me in my life. Well maybe I had met girls who had liked me but I had never met a girl like this who was like things had clicked and was obviously looking further ahead. I was like, holy shit this beautiful ass girl who I have no idea how I even managed to coax into bed has actually developed feelings for me. This proper changed my whole perspective on everything and that night I got really drunk and all I wanted to do was see her. I ended up getting really drunk and heading round to the hostel where she was staying. I had no idea what room she was in so banged on various doors until the manager got up, got angry and pointed me to her room. She was shocked to see me, let me in and the room was a really low ceiling so I ended up hitting my head on the roof. It really hurt so I lay down, passed out and then woke up it was morning, she had shit to do and I pretty much got the feeling she wanted me to leave. So I left and was kind of gutted to be honest, I tried again the same night to go round and woke up the manager again who got real pissed off so I wasn't let in this time and that's when I was just like i give up. I thought she liked me but obviously had changed her mind so the next couple of nights i just went back to my old self of getting drunk and chatting up different girls. Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a pimp or anything but in that scenario where you work in a bar at a party place, picking up girls is fairly easy compred to real life and I managed to sleep with a different girl in the two following nights. However at 5 o clock in the morning the second night there's a ring at the doorbell. This was quite the common occurrence in my house as I lived with two other guys who partied hard and were always out until the early hours. So leaving the girl I just slept with in bed, I get up butt naked, wrap a sheet around me and go answer the door. Who do i find standing there other than Lucy.  She had been knocking on the wrong door for ages which was pretty funny but then asked one of my friends and eventually found my room in a drunken state. I was like, look you can't come in there was a big party here last night and everybody is asleep in the living room ( that was my bedroom at the time and now looking back that was such a shit unbelieveable excuse but still I'd rather say that than yeah there's this girl in my bed). So I said wait two seconds I'll get changed and come out for a walk. I went back into my room, left a note for the girl in bed saying I'd gone shopping for milk ( i'm [REDACTED_NAME] bad at excuses) and put some clothes on and went for a walk with Lucy. We walked down to the beach and sat together leaning up a palm tree and I remember she said, ' i think I really like you Jordan' and I looked at her and said ' I really like you too'. We spoke about various other things but that's really the only thing I remember, I walked her back to her hostel and went back to mine feeling so happy that for the first time in my life a girl had actually said that she likes me and meant it. i got back to my room and the girl I had slept with had gone so I got back in bed and fell asleep with a smile on my face. From then on for like a month Lucy came round pretty much everyday and we  had such a good time, it was pretty much just sex all the time we never really spoke much but it just worked and things just clicked. I still don't think i loved her at this point but there was definately something there.

Towards the end of the trip I fell over and cracked my head open in a drunken state and Lucy ( who was supposed to be going to some wild party that night) instead came round and looked after me. She got cream, washed the blood off of me and cleaned my cut and we spent the next 4 days lying in bed together and watching David Attenborough documentaries. This is when I properly thought this girl is special. However I still refused to let myself get attached to her as I thought it would be just a holiday fling and that it was pointless getting attached. She had to leave pretty soon so I decided I was going to leave too as I really had no interest in being there after she had gone. We had one last big night, got super wasted which ended up with me passing out in a sink then I got up and went to say goodbye to her as she got on a coach to go to Lisbon. ( I gave her a bottle of blue powerade as a gift to say bye, this was kind of our thing).

Anyway she left to Lisbon and the following day or night ( I can't remember) I went home for a day then onto Oktoberfest. Another party place. As soon as Lucy had left though, all I could think bout was her. We spoke pretty much every single day on facebook and this is when I really got to know her as a person. We skyped sometimes for like 5 hours and just basically had a great relationship. It wasn't like a long distance relationship as we both were sleeping with other people but we knew something was there. The first time we spoke on skype was in germany and I actually broke down in tears and couldn't even explain why, I just missed her so much but still i was telling myself I didn't love her.

A few months pass and Oktoberfest is over, me and lucy have returned to our normal lives but yet we still skype pretty much every week and talk on facebook every day. I'd wake up in the morning looking forward to reading her messages then couldn't wait until the night to talk to her again (Australian and uk timezones are pretty fucked up). Anyway it worked out. However this is where I made my first proper mistake.

Now like I said, I have a hard time believing girls generally like me, I don't know why i just do. Maybe it's a self esteem issue I don't know but in the past every time i truly liked a girl I always got knocked back, so it was hard for me to believe Lucy generally liked me. My original plan was to save up over winter and go to Australia but I had various other friends asking me to do other things and to be honest they were tempting. I was still talking to Lucy quite regularly and she had her hopes up that i would be coming to Australia shortly, but my friends had asked me to go and do a ski season in France which I was really tempted by and I spoke to lucy about it and she was like yeah you should do it if that's what you want. She was actually putting a brave face on like the amazing girl she is, when I said I was going to France this actually made her so upset that she had to have the day off work. I didn't know about any of this. As soon as I told her I was going to France my mind went into the mode like have I made the right decision here and over the course of a day, I think it might of been my birthday, I went through so many mind changes but then spoke to Lucy about it. She was honest with me and said that when I told her I was going to France it actually really upset her. This broke me, I was like here I am [REDACTED_NAME] a beautiful girl across the world who wants me to come over and see her and instead I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to upset her by going to France and just partying again like i did in the Summer. So I changed my mind I said something chessy like ' I've thought about it, and instead of going to france I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to come to Australia, I just can't bear to go another 6 months without seeing you' . She was super happy again but at this point she had already cried her tears for me and begun to try to get over me so the feeling of love she had for me had changed. however this was the opposite with me, as soon as I had commited to Australia I practically began obsessing with her. Hanging on every message she sent, wondering why it took her so long to reply sometimes just being that general weirdo in your own head. I knew I was worrying over nothing but at the same time something was telling me I really like this girl, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to fly across the world to her and she's not going to like me as much as i like her. I was nevervous, anxious and didn't really sleep well the few nights before flying. I never told my Mom and Dad about her as if it didn't work out I didn't want them to know really. However I flew there, she met me at the airport and was in tears when she saw me which was nice, we went back to hers had great sex then had lasagne for dinner. (Lasagnes like my favourite and she made it especially for my arrival :)) 

For the first month things were pretty good however like any holiday romance things were never really the same. The first week i had serious jetlag and just wanted to cuddle her when I couldn't sleep however she just got annoyed with me because she can't sleep when someones touching her ( this wasn't the case in Lagos so this confused me). I'm a very affectionate person so with the combination of not sleeping, lack of affection from a person you flew across the world to see and just generally being in a random place not really having any mates i think is how I first began to develop anxiety. I met one of her best friends Hannah in one of the first two weeks and got really drunk on jaeger at lucys place. I don't know what happened but me and lucy argued over something because I was really drunk and I remember having a drunken flashback to thinking ' oh fuck, I've fucked everything up with her, i HAVE TO KILL MYSELf'. i woke up in her bed the next day obviously not dead but she wasn't there and I spoke to hannah and she said we argued and that I should speak to lucy and apologise. She said she had never saw me like that and that i had scared her, this made me sad so I cut down on my drinking quite a lot. The following month went good, I met her two roommates and they all liked me enough to ask me to move in. I was originally going to find my own place but I thought things are going well I might aswell stay here. People had warned me and her about moving in too soon but we both thought it was fine. That was until towards like the end of the second month. I'd been through a bit of a shit period, I'd left a waiting job to get a Graphic Design job which I ended up hating, I'd gone through the stress of buying a new car and I had generally just been acting quite panicky and rushed compared to how i normally am. I remember physically shaking when I was going to buy the car and was rushing around for money and different things not really thinking straight. I had also had my first proper panic attack i think when it came to making a meal for lucy. I was trying to be a perfectionist, the perfect boyfriend, putting a shit load of pressure on myself to get things right and beating myself up a lot if I said or did something she didn't like instead of just being like the cool easy going guy I was in Lagos, I had began hanging on every word she said. I planned Valentines meticulously and that went great to be honest but apart from that I was always putting a huge amount of pressure on myself to be the best boyfriend ever. Towards the end of the second month I had left the design job, got a bricklayers labourer job which I got fired from then managed to get another job doing the same thing but for more money and closer to home. Things were looking up for me but at the same time me and lucy felt weird, we weren't having sex that often at all, not Like Lagos. It was maybe once a week if I was lucky. I wanted to have sex all the time but she told me Lagos was different and she's just not that sort of sexual person in Australia. I decided to just deal with it, she meant to much to me so I was willing to deal with the no cuddles and lack of sex and just wanted to be there for her. I didn't realise this was actually taking it's toll on me mentally. We were showering together one day and the thought just crossed my mind that we hadn't been having sex and that something was up so I just asked ' do you want me to move out?' and she was like ' I don't know, maybe?'. This broke me, I don't know why but it brought me back to the first time I truly liked a girl and she knocked me back. I felt like I had to run away but I didn't, I just got really sad and then told her I loved her, which looking back was a bit stupid, even though I did love her I kind of didn't want to tell her until I knew it was right. 

Anyway, we got past that, things were a bit weird but I ended up finding a mates to move into ( happened to be a drug dealer) and we moved on from there. She'd come round occasionally and watch a movie and have dinner and i'd do the same round hers, things were nice. I still hadn't really managed to establish myself in Australia though as i didn't really have a group of friends I hung around with, I was always relying on Lucy to do something. I was also getting real itchy feet to travel and see the country which is what I imagined we would do, ( I would complain quite a lot that I wanted to get out of Melbourne and see the country). We went on little daytrips that were nice but our relationship wasn't exactly going fantastic, the spark had kind of gone and we weren't really having sex at all. I loved her hugely but didn't think she felt the same and she didn't but we never really brought it up. I think she didn't want to say anything at the risk of breaking my heart. one thing I have failed to mention also is that we still used to party, quite a bit. We'd go to various clubs and bars and get drunk and take mdma quite often, the drug of choice over in australia. I dabbled with drugs in Lagos a lot but never really felt any ill effects. The combination of drugs in australia that increase serotonin then dump it massively combined with a relationship where I felt I wasn't good enough and the stress of constantly finding a new place to live and working a  job i didn't really enjoy all kind of culminated in increased anxiety and eventually led me to have a breakdown in tears in her car. (I'd been waking up quite regularly shaking, having trouble sleeping, not wanting to go to work, worrying constantly about things i had no control over like does lucy still like me, and whats going to happen about my tax and the governments out to get me). So the breakdown happened, we decided i should see a psychologist and try and get my shit together.

Side note: In regards to the drugs, a lot of people are going to think yeah you did this to yourself and have no symptahy. And yeah they probably played a part in it, but to be honest it was never the drugs I was addicted to. it was th way me and Lucy were when we were both on drugs. It took me back to Lagos, she said things to me like ""you're amazing"", ""whatever happens lets always be friends"" and she was just the wild sexual girl i remember. We even had sex in the toilets of a nightclub at one point and this as dirty as it sounds actually turned me on massively, this was what i wanted all the time. So whenever we went out, if she was taking drugs I'd want them too so we could feel that connection however sometimes she would push me away and that would affect me more. Plus the comedowns really had started to take their toll on me and I just couldn't do it anymore.

I started seeing the psychologist and explained a lot of my issues with work, anxiety, moving country having a new relationship that wasn't exactly going as well as I imagined and we worked on various techniques for a few weeks. During this time we went to a house party and after a 30 day break on drugs, I got really drunk, smoked some weed and took some MD and Lucy saw me. She broke down in tears, this was the first time in ages that I realized she actually cared about me. I apologised and she called me an idiot for doing those things to me because i knew they weren't good for me. She was so sad and I couldn't make her happy and this killed me. She stopped crying eventually and we spoke and I called her a cab home and I got a cab back to my place. I was up all night feeling like I'd ruined everything between us and being an idiot for not beleiving she cared about me. At 3:00 in the afternoon I still hadn't slept but we spoke and I ended up around hers where she was throwing up from drunkness the night before. I gave her a rub on the back and stayed with her all day while she was sick then got some much needed sleep while i cuddled her. It was as much for me as it was for her. 

After that I found a new place to live with a guy called Russell, staying in a pretty big house with two dogs and a friend from work. It was a nice place but me and Lucy still weren't the best. i was convinced she should break up with me, that other boys were better for her than me and all other sorts of stupid shit. ( I really have stupid mood swings, sometimes everythings great, sometimes it's the end of the world). Everytime she mentioned going out and doing drugs i just thought I can't be that guy anymore she wants me to be, and just basically beat myself up into not thinking i was good enough for her. on top of that the psychologist i had been seeing had been telling me he felt I secretly wanted to break up with her, quit my job and go travel. Well the plan turned out that i was going to quit my job, I had stopped enjoying it and to be honest felt like i was breaking the law due to being classed as running my own business even though I worked for someone ( my emplyer made me do this to get paid). So I quit my job and felt super happy,  Lucy asked me to go to a gathering with her and her friends and i was like ok I'll drive so i don't drink. Went to the gathering and things were nice, I felt like a bit of a tag along still because they were all her mates but oh well, also I still hadn't found my own proper group of mates but this was something I was trying to work on. On the drive home, I went through a speeding camera and this really pissed me off. it was the second time i had done that and i was so angry with myself I just wanted to hit myself but Lucy hates it when I get angry so I tried my best to keep it in. i dropped her friends off then we got back to hers and we sat down and spoke. We hadn't had sex for like 3 weeks, we just felt weird and i just asked her what she thought was happening to us. She broke down in tears and i knew that we were gonna breakup. I broke down in tears too and knew it was over. We spoke about lots of stuff, and left on realy good terms but the next day and following 5 days I was so low and depressed (not suicidal just low). I'd been acting pretty crazy too, not able to make my mind up about whether to stay or leave Melbourne, not able to force myself to make a decision. This whole time in Australia I'd been skyping my Parents and they were worried about me too, my anxiety had really been affecting me the last few months and they didn't think I was having a very good time. Anyway, me and Lucy met up a few days later and spoke things through, it was heart breaking. She told me she had fell in love with me in lagos but when i said I was going to france her feelings were never the same. I regret that but at the same time never knew how she felt. We cried, went out for a meal as a last goodbye thing then we went back to mine. I wanted her to come in, she didn't think it was a good idea and I kind of agreed, I just didn't want to let go. I went inside, and had been thinking of leaving to go Sydney but just couldn't bring myself to do it at that point. Following morning I packed all of my shit in my car and left without really saying goodbye to anyone. I had had the opportunity to sell my car too instead as i felt it would lead to problems down the line but I just needed to escape. I went to pick up this girl i met online who wanted a rideshare but i was just so shaky and nervous that I had to drop her off and say I didn't feel safe driving her so decided to head up to sydney on my own. I drove from 5:30 in the morning until 21:00 the same night and it felt pretty great. I managed to crash with a girl and a family who I met abroad travelling and they were super kind a sweet to me. 

I was very low the night after getting there and told Lolly the girl i was staying with what I'd been going through, I also went to the doctors and was prescribed Citalopram which I think has made me pretty crazy to be honest. It's an antidepressant which makes you worse before you get better. I didn't even know if i was depressed or not i was just panicked. I'd go for walks on my own listening to sad songs with tears in my eyes and i just couldn't stop thinking about her, looking back I suppose this is pretty normal for an initial relationship breakup but it's my frist so gimme a break. I'd been practicing meditation and stuff which helped and i felt like I was slowly getting over her but after they upped my dose of citalopram things took even more of a shit turn. So when i arrived in Sydney i'd been crashing at this familys house, was nice having a place to chill and that but I kind of just hung around. I got to see Sydney for the first few days and then got a little side job but still was pretty down. I had a few day where i felt great but then they went away and i was on a downer, after upping my citalopram I was really weird. Getting really panicky when driving places, was trying to sell my car and stuff but couldn't think rationally or bring myself to do the things i need to do in order to sell it. Also my friend was asking me to drive up the coast with him to do some agricultural work ( if you do this in australia you can get your visa extended by one year ) and also to add to this Lucy had just arrived in Sydney to meet her sister and we had been texting about meeting up. Now all these things were normal and seemed like things I could handle however I'd been panicking, my Mom and Dad had been telling me to come home, everyone around me saying go home, the doctors saying go home and so instead of meeting up with lucy, or going to do my farmwork. I panicked, booked a flight home via China and got on a plane the same day. As soon as I arrived at the airport and my bag went away on the conveyor belt I knew i'd fucked up. I should of just saw Lucy, then gone and did my farmwork for 3 months while getting a psychologist sorted and selling my car during that period. However instead I've paid 1500$ to go on a flight home via China on the most depressing plane trip every. I got on the plane feeling mega out of it, couldn't really concentrate stressing out. Went to the toilet about 50 times to piss and would look at myself in the mirror and punch myself for being such an idiot. It was like I figured out the solution to all of my problems over there but by that time i was already on a plane ride home via fucking china and now I was fucked. Arrived in China, and what do I see, a flight back to Sydney. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] holy shit i could totally go back! Turns out there was no seats on the plane and to be honest my suitcase was on the other plane going back to the UK so I would of returned to sydney 1500$ down with no stuff either. So I tried to make the sensible option and go home.

Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME], when I landed after no sleep I actually felt alright, I saw the family went for a run and generally just chilled out. I went to sleep at the night for about an hour then began the freakouts and thoughts of killing myself. Apparently Citalopram can cause these thoughts, a few of my friends who have been on them have had the same thing but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] like how stupid is it that an antidepressant can cause suicidal thoughts / tendancies. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a suicidal person, I know there's so much i want to do in my life but all the mistakes i've made make me want to hurt myself too and it's really frustrating. Like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] some sort on consience battle. I'll cross the road and see a truck and think I could easily jump in front of that etc. I've spoke to my family about it and i got doctors coming out to see me quite often. The thing that pisses me off the mot is the fact I didn't have the balls to go and see Lucy again while she was in Sydney and wanted to see me, we ended it on good terms but I just freaked out. Anyhow now we come to this point, where I've took a valium but only slept 3 hours and instead spent the last 4 hours writing up a 5000 word essay as my first post on Reddit. Anyhow yeah, I don't know what I want you guys to say or even if i expect you to read any of this shit at all but yeah it's off my chest now and here and I can come back to it and add stuff.

In regards to suicide, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to do it. There's too much for me to live for, it's just I ran away from a lot of problems in Australia and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of myself for doing that, i should of been able to man up and deal with them while I was there but I just obviously haven't been thinking straight and just want to get my head back to how it used to be. I have these thoughts of hurting myself but am convinced it's the meds which is why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to get the docs to sort it out! My ultimate aim is to fix all of my problems I've left there but for now I need to rest. I've wrote this all from what I remember happening and there's probably somethings i missed out but yeah I Think this post went a bit manic at the end so I'll end it here and try get back to sleep, if any of you guys do end up reading this, well done! Hope it brought some entertainment to your day. Look forward to hearing what you got to say! Any views / advice / opinions appreciated. I want to fix all the shit I've done wrong. I've left a car there, fucked things up with the first love of my life, missed the opportunity to do farmwork with a friend, am $1500 down and need to fix this! Also apologies for the bad grammar, I've been writing this the last 4 hours and am pretty wired with no sleep, goodnight.",2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My experiences are not incredibly unique and are in no way the worst-case scenario. These stories and snippets of memories will be accounting mostly for family fighting, my depression and anxiety, and my feelings throughout all of it.

**The Religious Fights**

In my freshman year of high school, actually, the summer after were the first fights.  These, I call the Religious Fights.  I don’t remember much from these fights.  I mainly remember how I felt.  Again, I wasn’t as insightful as I am [REDACTED_NAME], I had much to learn, as I still do.  The religious fights started with my request to drop my Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD)  class, otherwise known as Catechism.  This request would also include me not getting confirmed in the church.

Of course, this was not an easy fight.  My parents really didn’t understand why it was so important to me that I stop going to church and not get confirmed.  And to be completely fair, I didn’t really know how to articulate any of my feelings.  I did my best to explain why I didn’t like the church without being offensive or out of line.  I explained in my best 15-year-old words, that I felt guilty from when I used to go to church and the Catholic school and had views and beliefs that contradicted my current beliefs and moral compass.  I absolutely hated going to church and CCD.  I hated believing one thing and being forced into a religion that went against exactly my beliefs.

I remember one night in particular when I was sitting at our kitchen island.  My dad and I were arguing, him angrily doing dishes, me crying on a kitchen stool.  Trying to find the words to explain trauma to your conservative parents is not easy in the least, but I did my best.  I consulted with my aunt (number 1)  throughout the series of fights, and she told me to write how I’m feeling, to be very respectful, and maybe find a church that I’d enjoy.  I thought that was reasonable and easy enough.  I wrote how I felt, the most respectfully I could, and mentioned trying to look for a desirable church.

Eventually, we came to an agreement, and by agreement I mean my dad telling me to “do what I want,” meaning no church, and with me not holding up my end of the bargain.  I never looked into new churches.  I never really intended to.  I was very much having doubts about my religion.  Both parties, my parents and I, left the fights hurt, misunderstood, and maybe 2% better at communicating.

During one of these small late-night fights, I got overwhelmed, so my sister and I went to my aunt (number 2), to calm down.  I was very grateful for this experience, my aunt simply consoled me, fed me ice cream, and asked minimal questions.  With future experiences, I would grow to be more thankful for this.  The church fights were particularly difficult for me, as my sister was scarcely involved.  She had already been confirmed and was already or nearly 18, so she had nothing to fight for.  She already didn’t need to go to church.  I also spoke my opinion and pleaded to not go to church, so that if my younger siblings felt the same as me in the future, my parents wouldn’t be blindsided, and my siblings would have a chance to voice their opinions.

**Dropping out**

I’ve struggled with anxiety probably all of my life, but it got significantly worse after Covid.  We went back to school in the fall of 2020.  I, unfortunately, wasn’t mentally prepared.  I tried to go back and made it about a quarter and a half into the school year.  My first panic attack happened during this time and I started convincing my mom to let me homeschool myself.  Eventually, it worked and we started working on unenrolling me.  For about a week I wasn’t in school and I wasn’t doing school, eventually, I got on track and figured out a curriculum.  But working on schoolwork would be an uphill battle for the next two and a half years.

**Tarot Night**

Another important event in the timeline of things is a “tarot night” with my aunt (number 3,) my uncle, and my sister.  At the time, my sister was far more into tarot and spirituality than I, so she was doing the readings.  The night didn’t start that way.  We were just stopping at my aunt’s house to chat or drop something off.  I remember my sister and aunt talking and getting the idea of doing tarot, I remember us getting very excited to do readings.  We ran back out to the car to grab my sister’s stuff.

Once we came back in, we got to talking about a lot of stuff.  We (my aunt, my sister, and I) all talked about mental health, specifically mine, tarot cards, crystals, the universe, religion, and our parents.  We all just ranted a lot, talked very honestly and just had a fun time.  We started the tarot readings, starting with my aunt first.  She found it very accurate and insightful and we chatted about the cards she got.  Then it was my uncle's turn for a reading.  He was very skeptical and even fearful of the readings.  My sister started pulling cards for him, he joked about not wanting to get the “death” card, and he sat down.  In the reading, she did indeed pull the “death” card and we chatted about what that actually meant.  He found his reading very accurate as well and was freaking out a little bit because of it.

Next, it was my turn, and I was already shaking with adrenaline and excitement.  My sister started pulling cards for me, and now I can’t remember which cards they were exactly.  I do, however, remember that they were very accurate with what was happening in my life.  Earlier that day we had talked about how I felt, (and feel), very connected to the moon always.  She pulled the ‘Moon’ card in her deck.  She and I freaked out, she was mainly laughing, and I got super paranoid, but it was all a good time.  We were extremely excited that they were all very accurate to each of us individually.  We chatted some more, talked about the readings, talking about how crazy it felt.  I’d had her do readings on me, but none were that extremely accurate.  All of the cards she pulled for me directly talked about or related to the things we were talking about before tarot cards got involved.

I can’t exactly grasp or explain precisely how it felt, but it was an amazing night.  My sister and I felt understood, and excited to do more tarot readings with our aunt and uncle.  It was a very significant night for me personally and would have a bit of significance later on.  I’d never been as close to this aunt as my sister was, but I felt like I was that night, and it was great.  It was much easier to talk to her when my sister was with me.  I had been (almost) completely transparent with her, as much as I could with an adult, and it didn’t feel like I would regret it.

**Big Fights**

There was one “big fight” that was very significant.  It’s the first fight I can kind of recall.  My sister and I had just gotten home, she used to do DoorDash, and I used to ride along to chat, listen to music, and kind of just look out for her.  It was football season and we had gotten home very late, and we had talked a lot about how we felt about our parents and whatnot.  I dropped my blankets and backpack next to the bathroom and saw that my younger brother was in the living room watching the TVs.  One of them being my TV, from my room upstairs.  So, I aggressively asked him why he had it, he explained, and I asked him to take up my TV while I went to the bathroom.  While I was in the bathroom, I heard my brother and sister arguing because he refused to take up my TV.

Things escalated quickly, once I got out of the bathroom I followed the argument upstairs to my brother's room.  They quickly got into it, fighting for unnecessary reasons, all of us getting very riled up and angrier by the minute.  He still refused to bring my TV up and just kept telling us to get out of his room.  My sister and I escalated the situation and went to wake up our dad.  We both thought he’d agree with us, but when he woke up he was angry at us.  Angry both because we woke him up and he was siding with my brother.  He informed us that he told my brother to take my TV down there.  We went on to argue about it not only being about the TV.  We were upset about other things as well as just wanting our brother to not be an ass.

We moved the argument to the kitchen and tried to get through it all.  There wasn’t much listening between anyone, and my brother was getting angrier by the minute.  My sister and I were getting angrier and angrier about how our brother was getting out of trouble so easily.  My sister and I felt that we were both getting into trouble all the time for very minor things.  We felt like we were constantly disappointing everyone, and not being truly seen.

The argument expanded to more than just my brother not being helpful.  My sister and I started talking about how we were feeling, and us feeling unwelcome and under-appreciated.  This, of course, is not a fun thing for parents to hear, and not a fun thing to misunderstand either.  Our parents misunderstood our words for criticism, and we misunderstood their anger as not caring.  The fight ended with three out of four of us in tears, and not much being accomplished.  My sister used the line “I don’t feel welcome in this home,” which stuck around for months and months and maybe even years later.  As she choked out those words, I started silently balling as well.  This made our mom ultimately ask if I felt the same way, which I did.  I felt the same way as my sister, but looking back the way she worded it was not exactly *how* we felt.  But it was the best we had.

This was the most significant fight that I can remember, it kind of jump-started everything into extremely fast motion.  I remember the exhausting feeling of actually speaking about my thoughts and feelings for the first time ever.  I remember the feeling of just shaking and crying on a stool in the kitchen.  Nearly unable to make eye contact with either parent and almost verbally incapable.  After this fight, everything went to hell.

**Unwanted Text Messages**

The very next day, I was in Spanish II.  I remember this day very vividly and regrettably so.  My sister was the teacher’s assistant for that class period, so we basically always spent that class speaking in our secret eye language.  That day I wasn’t doing too well, with the night before stuck in my brain, I did my best to keep my head down and just get through the day.   I planned on going home and doing my best to relax, but that plan was quickly diminished.

Once I got the first text, I felt so clouded.  I didn’t know how to respond for one, and I felt totally and completely betrayed.  My aunt (3) texted my sister and me in a group chat with the three of us.  I knew she didn’t mean any sort of harm, but at the time it was more than unexpected.  She asked us why we were feeling the way we were feeling.  Which was confusing in a number of ways.  On one hand, I felt that we had talked about it, enough for her to know, when we did the tarot readings.  The tarot reading night had been a week, maybe two prior.  Did she not listen?  On the other hand, it was confusing because my sister and I had never articulated how we felt.  And certainly not over text in Spanish class.  Now I could talk about what was all said, I have all of the texts still, but that anger and those feelings don’t need to be dug up.  The significance of this though, is the utter and total betrayal we felt.  Again we had talked to our aunt about nearly all of the stuff we were upset about and she ‘forgot’ it all.  She acted as though she was protecting our mom from us.  Isolating.  She didn’t need protecting from us.  She needed to listen.  They needed to listen.

In the text exchanges my sister and I explained how we were feeling with the most respect we could, and without talking about specific situations.  We didn’t have specific situations that we were upset about, we wanted someone to listen to us.  We wanted someone to hear us.  Our aunt talked about how she knew how it felt to be a mother, and that we shouldn’t criticize her.  My sister and I were baffled that it had come to this.  Our supposed to-be trusted aunt texting us after a terrible night to bug us more about the terrible things.

I remember my sister and I exchanging looks throughout the class, and both of us just immediately knowing how the other was feeling.  The betrayal was unmistakable.  I plopped my head down on my desk and did my best to stop the tears from running down my cheek.  Everything was overwhelming and I wasn’t able to handle it all.  I didn’t understand it at all.

A few more texts went back and forth between the three of us, I only texted once I had thought everything through and not in class.  I did my best to not have a panic attack in school but was severely failing.

The texts went on for the whole day and maybe even on into the next, I don’t quite remember.  They dragged on and did nothing good.  Tensions rose.  Texts can’t be read correctly and even worse so in an argument or a situation like this.  After a while, the shaking and crying, and anxiety attacks died down with the texts.  But the anger lingered.  They lingered for quite some time.

**Big No - No** 

For a while, I had been struggling with my mental health.  I didn’t know what I was doing wrong, I didn’t understand why I wasn’t getting better.  I stayed in bed 24/7, and binge-watched shows for days.  My room was a disaster always.  I had dirty dishes lying everywhere, clothes everywhere.  I wasn’t doing well.  My mind was fighting against itself.  Every day was an uphill battle.  I was at my lowest yet.

I got into an argument with my mom, and I can’t even recall what it was about now.  I do know that I was angry and acting out.  I must not have been listening to my mom because she called my dad to come and talk to me as well.  I was lying in bed when they barged into my room and started yelling at me.  Did I deserve it?  That is quite possible, but I didn’t need both of them there getting after me.

They started taking my things away, they started taking my iPad, phone, and TV away.  I argued that if they wanted to take my stuff away, they’d have to pay me for it.  I bought my things, how was it their right to take them away?  They claimed they were helping me and that phones and media were clouding my judgment and influencing me in bad ways.  I kept arguing and making them mad, and it escalated.  I asked why he was doing this or something like that and he said something along the lines of “Cuz I know how you kids think,” and I nearly yelled, “REALLY?! YOU KNOW THAT I WANT TO DIE?!”  Which was probably not what I should have said.

They told me we were going to the ER.  They kind of flipped out.  And I just started having many panic attacks.  It freaked me out, I said something finally, broke finally.  But I didn’t say exactly what I was feeling, I said what would get attention.  I said what would get me help finally.  I felt like they were going to lock me up.  Looking back, I’m sure that’s a scary thing to hear as a parent.  As a kid, however, it felt like no one was listening, and it told me that I had to scream and cry and say extreme things to get help or attention.

**Yet Another Fight**

**\***For some background, in between fights, my sister had written to my parents about everything she and I were feeling, and in this, she came out as gay.\*

One night my younger sister (sister 3), came into my room after having a night terror.  So, she and I talked for a while, lying in my bed.  We talked about her school and her day, and I made sure she knew that the only “monsters” that existed were people.  I told her this to try to make her less scared.  Monsters are much more scary than people.  Right?  I also talked her up, and complimented her, telling her how perfect she is.  I told her to never let anyone tell her any different.

We fell asleep and I didn’t think to move her to her bed in the night, I didn’t want her having another nightmare while I was asleep.  When we woke up, I sent her to get ready for school, and then Mom came into the room.  She started asking me what we had talked about the night prior, and as an angry kid, I denied her the information.  I said things along the line of “You don’t need to know” and “Why does it matter.”  This of course escalated things greatly.

Throughout the day, Mom and Dad grilled me about what we had talked about, insisting that I was trying to “teach” her something or “push my agenda.”  I kept pushing the point of her being my sister, and my right to speak to her in private.  I didn’t understand why I was being seen as the enemy.  I had a conversation with my sister, was that so bad?

The next day, a few of my siblings and a couple of our cousins went to our dad’s work storage building.  Once they got back, my sister (3) came to me and told me about inappropriate images and conversations that had been seen and said at the building.  Seeing that this was not my place to talk with her about I went to bring it to my parents.

This pissed my mom off.  She thought that I was trying to parent my sister.  She was upset that I was a safe space for my sister.  I, of course, thought this ridiculous.  My sister was having nightmares, I’d rather her come talk to me than be scared and alone.  My mom told me that the moment I “endangered” her daughter, (my sister,) I was no longer her daughter, I was a threat.  I was dumbfounded.  That was the most outrageous thing I’d ever heard.  I was a danger?  How dare she?  I was being a sister, I was being a friend.  I was in no way endangering her.  I wanted privacy, I wanted basic respect from my parents.  Was purposefully keeping the conversation private a bad choice?  Probably.  But I didn’t deserve this, I didn’t deserve becoming a stranger.  I escalated the argument to more than just my younger sister.  I brought up the church and how it was homophobic.  I said many hurtful things about their parenting, saying they were in the wrong for continuing to take their kids to a homophobic church.  Especially when their second oldest child was gay and they knew.

My older sister then came in after work, to pick me up.  She worked for DoorDash, and I used to go with her.  As she walked in and stopped next to me, I was so angry I was just spewing words and questions.  I asked, “How can you go to and send your kids to that church when you know it’s homophobic?”  I also simply told them that they were homophobic, that that made them homophobic.  They didn’t like this at all.

Push came to shove, I’m not sure exactly how it got there, but Mom said that she didn’t necessarily believe or agree “with the lifestyle.”  It was point-blank.  She didn’t support my sister.  She didn’t support me.  In that moment, I didn’t recognize my mother.  And it took a hell of a long time to recognize her again.  My sister and I left the house in a rage and in tears.  We drove to the city in which she DoorDashed.  It was a forty-five-minute ride and we spent the most of it sobbing.  By the time we could catch a breath, we talked about leaving, about turning eighteen and moving away, and how hard it would be leaving the kids.  We talked about how we were feeling about Mom and the entire situation.  I remember feeling sick, wanting to puke.  I felt unloved, I felt betrayed.  It wasn’t fair.  I didn’t deserve this.  My sister didn’t deserve this.

**Therapy**

After several discussions and arguments, they agreed to get me in therapy.  My mom picked a therapist for me, which I wasn’t crazy about, but it was much better than nothing.  She called and set up a first appointment for sometime in the beginning of summer.  Things died down during the wait for therapy, and I got very into journaling.  I would journal every day about my intentions and gratitudes.  Soon I started writing about everything that was going on in my life.

I don’t remember all of my first therapy session, but I’m pretty sure it was uneventful.  I believe I only answered questions and filled out paperwork.  My therapist told me at the end of the hour that I would only have to be in therapy for three months.  I didn’t really know how to feel about this.  I didn’t think much of it after a while, I thought it was working.  It felt like it was working.  I’d go to therapy every Wednesday or every other Wednesday.  Mom would drive me, and we would sit in silence for about 25 minutes.  She would go get groceries or run errands for an hour while I was at my appointment.

My therapist would give me thinking strategies, and productivity strategies, as well as teaching me about why my brain was the way it was.  She asked me if I “had a plan,” as in to end my life, and I said of course not.  I didn’t.  I only wanted to get better, that’s what I was doing there.  I didn’t ever really get very in-depth with my therapist.  She would mainly guess what I was feeling and then ask me questions.  She was usually always right, but I just didn’t feel that comfortable with her.

She could tell pretty quickly that I was tense around my mom.  I didn’t really want to talk about that at the time.  I was focused on getting myself better and not necessarily fixing things with my mom.  My therapist could tell I was hesitant, but almost every session she’d ask if I wanted to have an appointment with my mom, and every time I’d tell her that I didn’t think I was ready.  I wanted to get better but I was still angry.  I could get better and still be angry right? 

**Memoo**

One morning, Mom had told me to get my younger brothers ready to go to our aunt’s (3) house.  My mom was in school to become a midwife, and I was homeschooled, so neither of us could handle the boys that day.  So, I woke up and got the kids ready to go to my aunt’s.  I got them clothed before myself, and soon enough my grandma was there to pick them up.

It was a nice sunny day out, so I walked out with the boys to my grandma.  I sent them to her from the deck in my PJs.  She put the boys in her jeep and started for her door.  She stood outside her door and started yelling at me.  She started saying things like “Is there a reason you can’t watch kids?”  As well as things like “You’re so disrespectful,” and whatnot.  I was overwhelmed and confused as to why I was getting cussed out.  I had never seen my grandma get so angry like that, especially at me.  My grandma, (and grandpa,) had been a safe bet through all of the fights.  They stayed mainly neutral and my sister and I could talk to them a little about everything.  This felt like a betrayal and I didn’t want to talk to them anymore, I couldn’t trust them.

After Memoo left, I made a point to text her about how I was feeling.  I told her it was unfair that she was yelling at me when she wasn’t informed about what was going on.  I told her that Mom had told me to get the boys ready to go to our aunt’s.  I told her that it was hard enough to be in all of the fights and now therapy and that she ultimately didn’t have a right to yell at me.  She responded with an apology and an explanation.  She told me that her “bucket was full” and some other things.  I blew it off and didn’t think much of it, but looking back, Memoo was the last person my sister and I felt we could trust, and that trust felt lost after that.

Remembering this now, I am [REDACTED_NAME] proud of myself for standing up for myself.  Even though I couldn’t say anything in the moment, I didn’t let her walk all over me.  I was already feeling like everyone was in our business, so this made things worse.  It was hard enough to feel like nothing was changing between me and my sister and my parents, but to have everyone watching and judging us as well, that was too much.

**A Difference**

Therapy seemed to have been working and things with the parents were dying down.  It was summertime and I was very productive.  I was using the techniques my therapist gave me, and I was steering clear of problems with my parents.  Everything seemed to be going well.  I was also feeling very optimistic about my future and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.

I was excited about getting better and couldn’t wait to find out where I was going.  I knew before therapy that I wasn’t doing well but I always held on to the fact that I had hope and I had a plan to get better.  I always kept a plan, I wanted to travel, figure out college, and find something that I truly loved to do.  The first step to all of that was getting better.  Easy enough.  Therapy should do the trick, right?  I guess I would find out.

A friend of mine and I hadn’t hung out in a while, but when we did that summer we got into some heavy conversations.  We talked about how scared we were to move away and “leave” our siblings.  We bonded over our extreme love for our siblings and the fear of betraying them.  We talked a lot about our pasts and traumas.  I filled her in with everything that had gone down with my parents over the past three years, and all of it was pretty familiar to her.

We talked about our younger selves and I told her about my mental health problems even as a child.  I told her how I had low self-esteem even as a kid.  I talked about my older siblings and how they were when we were younger.  I told her how long I’d felt how I was feeling.  We cried a lot, and it ultimately made us a lot closer.  She had been an inspiration and a role model for me all throughout my childhood and I was glad I was friends with her.  I was sad that we were bonding over traumas like this and not over common interests and favorite shows.

**Family Vacation**

Family vacation was such a bittersweet experience each time.  This time, however, it was very raw.  I love traveling, but family drama is legit the worst.  Our family vacations consist of our extended family.  Our whole family, ten kids, Mom and Dad, all of our cousins and their parents, and my maternal grandparents.  That brings it to about thirty of us.  We’re a big group.  We all drive and stay at an AirBnB, and do things like hike, shop around at local shops and towns, etc.  My sister and I always stick together during family trips, and try to steer clear of any drama.  We’re usually pretty good.  This one, however, didn’t go so well.  My oldest brother, the prodigy of the family, was leaving for basic training, so there was some tension for the last few days of the trip.

On the way home my grandparents, one of my aunts (1), my older sister and both of my younger sisters stayed at another AirBnB before going home the next day.  During our stay there, Memoo and our aunt got into a very heated argument.  I mean like yelling and screaming.  I’m not quite sure what they were arguing about but they were getting into it.  Eventually, everyone went to bed and all of us sisters settled in the living room on the pull-out.  My older sister and I chatted until late that night talking about how crappy it was that they were yelling in front of the kids.  My younger sisters were like 11 and 8.

We talked a lot about how the adults in our lives needed to learn to communicate.  We were super frustrated that we were better at communicating than any of them.  The next day was very tense, we didn’t know how to feel or act.  None of us were sure if everyone was completely cooled down.  This angered me more.  There was no good reason for adults to yell at each other.  It was ridiculous.

**Decisions**

Some months after vacation, I decided to quit my job.  I needed to focus on school rather than making money.  I had already lessened my hours greatly, but I also just didn’t enjoy my job.  I stopped working there in December or January.  I started a new part-time job in the beginning of January but I knew to not take too many hours.

My parents were always getting on me about my financial situation.  Now, they were always fair about this.  I needed to be called out.  At the time, however, I felt overwhelmed.  I didn’t want to worry about that, I didn’t want to be constantly yelled at all the time.  I wanted to relax and not get constantly ridiculed.  I can see now that they wanted to help and teach responsibility, but I thought I was responsible.  It was frustrating at the time because I didn’t feel like they were giving me enough attention in other more serious matters, but they were grilling me about my money situation.  It felt targeted and unnecessary.

Of course, it didn’t help the situation when I did quit working for my dad.  My dad didn’t really understand why I needed to focus on myself and school.  And to be fair, I didn’t really feel like explaining it at all, so there was no way he would understand it.  My financial state kept getting worse and worse, and so did the pressure from my parents.  I didn’t understand why they cared so much about my money and not about how I was feeling or doing mentally.  Looking back, there wasn’t much for them to worry about other than money when I didn’t ever tell them how I was feeling.  But it created pressure and tension nonetheless.

**My Aunt**

Aunt (number 3) became quite the villain in my and my sister's lives.  Neither of us felt like we could trust her and for the most part, we just steered clear of her.  It wasn’t too hard, we both pretty much stayed in our rooms all the time and the only time we saw our aunt was at family events like birthdays or holidays.  Our aunt pretty frequently went off on my sister.  One time in particular, my sister was preparing to tour a college and asked our dad to go with her.  She did this because our dad is who we usually ask to do things like that.  Mom doesn’t really do stuff like that with us.  I’ve always thought our dad was more reasonable than our mom.

Our aunt called my sister and cussed her out for not inviting our mom to the college visit.  She said my sister was selfish and didn’t think of our mom’s feelings.  She went on and on about how our mom tries very hard with us and deserves our respect.  Under different circumstances maybe this would have been warranted or even made sense.  But it was nothing about Mom or disrespecting her.  Our aunt just didn’t know the whole story.  Our dad has always shown more interest in things like that, and my sister knew that.  There wasn’t an agenda.  There was no intent to make Mom feel bad, and she didn’t ask to go, she never said anything.

**Religion**

Religion was a big thing with my parents.  There were many times that I brought up being mentally ill and they told me it was caused by my lack of religion.  This was confusing to hear when I felt I needed professional help.  Hearing that I simply needed God or Jesus made me feel like a failure.  Something that I used to believe would help me?  Something that helps so many other people couldn’t help me?  If I could believe I would.  How easy it would be to believe.  Maybe it would help me, but there was no way it could.  I couldn’t believe, and I can’t believe still.  I understand now, of course, that my parents believe in their God so much and they want me to have that.  They wanted to help, and they thought they were doing so.

**Wrist**

My wrist is something that has bothered me for years.  It will get irritated when I overuse it, and then it’s nearly unusable for weeks.  Most of the time this is just annoying, but it did start to cause problems and even mental distress.  I am a very artistic person and it became hard to do what I loved.  I asked and asked and asked my parents for an appointment to get it checked out, and it took an extreme amount of time for us to find the time.  Eventually, I got an appointment and we found out it was tendinitis.  Which was extremely unhelpful.  We got me a wrist brace and went on with our lives.  But it became increasingly hard to not be able to do what I love.  Painting and drawing have always been an escape for me, and not being able to do that took a toll on me.

**A Future**

Some time passed, things died down, and things got back to almost normal.  There were still some definite tensions and things left unsaid, but everyone had things to do and lives to get back to.  Including myself.  As much as all of that had sucked I too, got busy.  I was getting more busy with my school and choir stuff.  I began to overwork myself and not pay attention to my needs.  I wasn’t taking ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reaks or taking care of myself properly, and was just burnt out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After some time I was busying myself so much I wasn’t even allowing myself to feel emotions.  I was swinging between extreme thoughts and feelings and having no feelings.  I kept getting lower and lower.  At the time I didn’t think I was that low but looking back, I was the lowest I’d ever been.  I was having many dark and intrusive thoughts and many panic attacks.  I thought it would be easier and better if I wasn’t around anymore.  I didn’t think I deserved to keep going, I didn’t think I was contributing enough.  I needed a lot of help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My panic attacks were scary.  I didn’t really know what they were, or why they were happening.  I would be in show choir practice and it was like something in me would flip.  I would look around and everything was too loud and silent at the same time.  It felt like when you stand up too fast and get dizzy, but then that feeling wouldn’t go away.  I knew almost immediately every single time and excused myself to the locker room.  I can remember sitting on the concrete with my entire body shaking.  I’ve heard people talk about their panic attacks and how they black out and don’t remember anything.  Not me.  I remember every second of my panic attacks and how I felt.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] qualified to say which is worse but remembering can be a curse.  Not understanding why you’re panicking and why you can’t calm yourself is scary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never before in my life had I not known how I was feeling.  Being at a loss for breath is a new feeling that I wouldn’t wish upon anyone.  There were many days that I had panic attacks that I just had to leave practice early.  I would go home and just cry and cry and pass out.  It was exhausting.  Show choir was beginning to add to the stress of my regular life rather than be a fun thing, and an escape.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It didn’t take long before I hit very very low.  If I didn’t have great friends I’m not sure where I’d be today.  I got to a place where I didn’t care about anything.  I was so numb to my feelings and my surroundings.  I stopped eating and started to hurt myself.  Looking back I think I just wanted and needed control in my life.  I hated the routine that was my life.  Any time I thought I did something wrong or embarrassing I would tell myself I didn’t deserve to eat.  Didn’t finish homework?  Hungry?  Too bad.  I started waiting for anyone, anyone in the world to notice.  But that was unfair because I was unwilling and too embarrassed to tell anyone.  The only people who knew the state I was in, were the people who *saw* it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would write in my journal about how I was feeling every once in a while.  I explained it like this:  I’ve been depressed before, I’ve been low before, but I’ve always had hope and I’ve always seen a future for myself.  But at this time, I didn’t see that.  I had no ideas or hopes or dreams.  Nothing seemed like enough to live for.  I wasn’t living for myself.  I was alive because I didn’t have the guts to leave my loved ones.  I didn’t have the guts to not be there for my siblings, for my friends.  It got to the point where I was having panic attacks every night.  I didn’t know how to get better.  I was asking for therapy again and getting radio silence from my parents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was worried about what I would do.  My thoughts were scaring me.  How could I think those things about myself?  How could I be so mean to myself?  Did I deserve to feel this way?  Was it my fault?  It had to be, right?  I told myself I was doing it for the attention, but then where was the attention?  I was so low and no one saw me?  I moved everywhere like there were chains on my feet like I had actual weights on my shoulders.  No one talks about how dark and how hard it is to be depressed, how ugly it is.  Not eating, not showering, not sleeping, sleeping too much, it’s not pretty.  How could I let myself get this low?  I was supposed to be the one no one worried about.  Why did I want to be worried about?  I was letting everyone down by being unwell.  I needed to get better on my own.  After some time I realized the hard truth that no one was coming to save me.  I needed to save me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Getting Better**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This last summer my friends, sister, and I all went on a road trip to Colorado.  This trip was extremely enlightening and just an amazing experience.  Only a few months after my lowest point, we went on this trip, and I’m so grateful we did.  It didn’t feel very groundbreaking at the time, but once we got back, everything felt very in perspective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Things started looking up after that.  I figured out how much school I had left to complete, I decided to stop doing show choir, I started working more as a barista, and started doing more of my hobbies.  I started to love life again.  I became more and more productive and started taking care of myself better.  There wasn’t a definite ‘cure’ to my mental illnesses.  It was a gradual turn of events.  I didn’t even notice I was getting better.  Eventually, when people asked me how I was doing, I didn’t have to lie when I said I was doing good.  It was relieving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I’ve grown so much since all of this, the last six months alone felt like a lifetime.  My mentality has matured exponentially in these last few years.  I’ve learned to see things from all perspectives and understand where people are coming from.  I’ve learned from all of these experiences.  I believe that you can learn something from every person you meet and every experience you have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I’ve learned to be proud of myself.  I brought myself up from that awful place.  I got myself better.  I started taking care of myself, and it wasn’t easy.  I deserve props for that.  I went through a lot, maybe not as much as others, but for me?  A lot.  There is much more I left unsaid, untouched, but this is the most of it.  I’ve learned so much from all of this, learned things I’ll be able to use later on in life.  I’ve learned that communication is so so important and that lack of communication can destroy people and relationships.  I’ve learned that people are usually not evil even if they seem that way in the moment, most are just misunderstood.  I’ve learned a lot about myself, how I recharge, what triggers me, and how to regulate my feelings on my own.  I’ve learned to take care of myself properly, eating better, and starting skin care.  I’ve learned that anxiety is not something you can ‘cure’ but something you learn to cope and live with.  Things that feel small and insignificant, but would have been so helpful years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can’t say that these things were fun to go through, but I don’t regret them happening.  Learning to love life again was a beautiful thing.  Getting excited over small things again is a beautiful thing.  Sometimes you need to get knocked down lower than you’ve ever been to stand up taller than you ever were.  I don’t think I’d appreciate life as much as I do now if I hadn’t gone through what I did.  I’d rather these experiences be behind me and all these lessons learned rather than have to be learned later on.

11lp55y,1678258573,3/8/2023 6:56,confession,when i was younger i would make fake puke at 3am to get out of school,"now, let me preface this by saying i was clearly in no way a normal child. most kids would simply go to their parents room, say “mommy i’m sick”, and proceed to get a day off school. i did no such thing. i nearly never got sick i’m not sure if it was just my immune system or a lack of being exposed to shit but i think i got sick 2 times from grades 1-9 (by sick i mean sick enough to puke). i was always jealous of the kids that were able to get out of school because they were sick since i never got to miss school, so when i wanted to get out of having to go i would sneak into the kitchen at 3 in the morning, take some leftovers and shove them into a tupperware container with some hot water. i would then take the leftover mush and dump it into the toilet at a reasonably puke-sounding rate and fake gag. this would normally wake up my mom as her room was right next to the bathroom. i’d then shove the tupperware container in the cupboard under the sink and wait for her to come in. mind you i only did this 4 ish times over the course of several years but it worked every time. totally don’t know if my mom caught on or knew but i feel like there’s no way she couldn’t have known. just thought i’d share and see if anybody else was as weird as me growing up lol.",2143,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1jcqtey,1742146400,3/16/2025 17:33,TrueOffMyChest,I stopped drinking and realized I don't like my girlfriend,"Basically the title. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a relatively new relationship, about 9 months. Although it hasn't been too long, we've already had the marriage and kids conversations and are pretty much on the same page as it relates to timelines and expectations.

  
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a heavy drinker (about 4 times a week). Because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] older I've decided to stop drinking and smoking to save money, prioritize my health and re-evaluate my relationship with alcohol. It's been just over a month.

Since I've stopped I've been much calmer, argue less and listen much more. It's been okay so far, but really everything she does just annoys me. If I was drinking some of the things she says when she tries to argue with me I would've argued back. Since I've been sober I just listen to her complain and try to  draw me into an argument. I wait until she shuts up, then try to change the topic to something else. We sit in silence a lot more now. 

  
The relationship has positives, so I have no intention of leaving. It's actually the main reason why I stopped drinking and smoking. I also know you're not supposed to make any major decisions when you've just made major lifestyle changes. I also know these changes could be a big contributor to me being irritated in general. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] just here to vent. 

  
Hoping it all works out in the end. ",3722,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14dztkz,1687232192,6/20/2023 3:36,offmychest,"Update: I am battling cancer. I'm gay, but I have realized I love my best friend of 25 years (a man). I told him everything and it was the best day of my life. Thank you all.","If you want the original story, it has a similar title. Here is my update. So tonight I told James. I told him everything. Gosh. I just wish I could relive this night over and over again. I've never been so happy.  


He came into my room this evening like he always does. Greeted me, ""Hello, how's my Amumu doing today"". I told him I was doing well. He told me I looked beautiful. Which is NOT true but it still felt so sincere. Then he started unpacking the stuff he brought me today. I asked him to stop and just come sit with me because I wanted to talk to him. He nodded and came and sat down next to me.""What's up?"" He asked.  


It took me a bit to gather myself. I kept getting distracted by his eyes. How he looks at me sometimes, I don't know how to describe it. I told him ""I love you."" and he just kind of laughed and touched my hand before casually responding  ""Oh I know that, I love you too."" In retrospect this wasn't the best way to start I guess since we've said that enough with a different understanding that he didn't get what was happening. He started to get up again to unpack the snacks and I grabbed his arm and asked him to let me finish. He looked confused but he nodded and sat back down.  


And then I did it. I told him everything. I told him about all the times in the past I'd thought about just marrying him despite my sexuality. I told him my favorite memories of him and how they make me feel. I told him he'd always been my best friend and the person I trusted the most. I told him I made a mistake and I should've chosen him. I then basically devolved into reciting the last paragraph of my first post to him -- he's the face I see when I think about feeling loved, the embrace I feel when I think about being safe, it doesn't matter what we do -- if we're together I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and he's the only thing I want for the rest of my life.  


He basically froze. He said nothing -- just looked at me as I spilled everything. I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure he even blinked. When I finished and looked up at him he was sitting there like a statue with his mouth slightly open, still enough it was like he forgot to breathe. James always knows what to say so this was a little unnerving to me.  


I started to ask him if everything was alright but before I could finish his expression broke. He exhaled into a weak but incredibly tender, quivering smile, and he just reached out  and pulled me into a hug. I buried my head in his chest and his arms just wrapped around me. I just melted into him. He was so gentle. It felt so easy. It felt so right. Then he started crying, and then I started crying. He's been coming here through 2 years of cancer treatment and never seen him cry til now. He held me for a while but however long it was it wasn't long enough. He still hadn't actually said a single word since I finished talking but I guess he didn't really need to… then he finally answered my question with: ""now it is"".  


When he finally pulled away, his face was red from crying but he just looked so happy. He looked at me for a bit. It was kinda cute because he had a little trouble maintaining eye contact, which he usually doesn't. He was like a little boy again. Then he finally looked right at me and  he just said ""You are the only thing I've ever wanted."" Then I started crying again and he started crying again and he pulled me to him and held me again. I wish it never ended.  


A little bit later once we exhausted our crying capacity, I showed him the post. He made a few jokes about wanting to meet this ""James guy"" and about how he had better go and thank my mom for her 20 year wingwomanship lol. Then after he finished reading it he kissed me. It felt easy, not scary at all and just… right. He asked me if it lived up to my daydreams and I chuckled and said yes. Then he said ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] so sure myself, I think I need more data"" and kissed me again (he is so ridiculous but this was smooth as butter).  


Then after that we started talking, and I guess he told me everything too. He said he'd loved me since we were little kids. Told me he still has every drawing/letter/kraft I ever made for him in a safe that he took with him to college and has taken everywhere he's ever lived. We talked about the day I came out as gay to him, and how he'd figured it out earlier -- but he struggled to accept it for months in secret because he had lived his entire life up to that point assuming we would be a family and wanting nothing else.  He told me he thought about our last night before college all the time and he kept hoping that entire night I'd say something before he left, because then he'd have transferred colleges to stay with me. Told me he actually took a very long way home just to prolong the time when we were holding hands and I was sleeping on his shoulder and that it was to this day his favorite memory.  


Then he looked at me with those piercing green eyes and said ""For me… there has never been anyone else.""  He loved once (me) and then struggled through a bunch of rebounds and even though he had learned to bury it and move on with life and was happy in our friendship his heart had only ever belonged to me. Honestly I guess I should've known this (My dad told me he was sure this was true before but I didn't listen) but I was flustered (and deeply moved).  I joked that he should enter the Olympics as a torch carrier and he said ""they'd never have a chance i'm [REDACTED_NAME] greatest there ever was."" Awww.  


We sat and talked and reminisced some more, mostly about when we were kids. I found out some things I never knew because he avoided telling me how romantic somethings were for him after I came out, but I also kinda realized… I think they felt romantic to me too. Then he sang me some of ""our songs"" (his voice is so beautiful). We had another embrace and another kiss. Both still felt divine. I can't wait to have my hair back again so he can pet it like he used to when we were kids.  


Then I brought up the sex question, and omg it was the cutest shit ever. I barely got to say anything before he started tripping over himself like ""Look, I don't even care -- I don't need that, if we need mistresses or something we can do that it doesn't bother me, I just want to wake up with you every day."" Which was sweet, but then I told him that even though I didn't know how that would go (and I might not be able to) I wanted to try with him anyway when I got better -- and oh my god he turned tomato red and could barely look at me. Literally could not even manage to form a sentence in response -- just mumbled incoherently before managing to get out ""um, ok, if you're sure"". This man has been married and had 6 girlfriends but he completely just falls all over himself at the thought, god it was adorable. This is the only thing I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a little worried about, but I do want to try. I mean I liked the kissing which I thought was completely impossible. And I know that if it doesn't turn out well it won't ruin anything and we'll still be together and just figure something else out for that one need.  


Then we talked about the cancer. He is so sure I'm [REDACTED_NAME] make it. It's so touching. It took a little while to get him to take the other possibility seriously. When I finally did and I told him that it's the reason I didn't tell him sooner, he held my hand and told me that if that happens -  he'd be ok because he'll always know that he was one of the lucky ones because he was mine. Jesus fucking Christ I almost lost it. Then he said if we don't have that much time left, we better make sure every minute counts. I said ""that's pretty hard to do in a hospital"" and he replied ""what do you mean? We're both here and that makes this the best place on earth."" Dear God, what did I do to deserve this man? I teared up again and he held me one last time. Then the doctors came in. He kissed me goodnight. We both said I love you but it felt so different. It's never felt so good to say or hear those words. Then he smiled at me and left.  


I was so excited the first thing I did was call mom and she was just ecstatic. I think she might be happier than me, which is saying something lol. As soon as I told her what happened and that James and I are together she just started crying and talking about what a good boy he is, how she just knew this would happen and that she can rest easy now because she knows I will always be loved and taken care of. Plenty of her ""destiny"" talk which usually gets on my nerves but honestly I was so happy tonight, fuck it I'm [REDACTED_NAME] board. Maybe it was destiny. I guess sometimes mom really does know best.  


I feel like a teenager again. I never thought I'd feel this way again in my life. I never even imagined if I did it would be for a man. God I love him so much. Now I can't understand what I was ever worried about or why I didn't do this years ago. Thanks so much to everyone who read my story and helped give me the perspective and courage I needed to finally do what I should've done years ago. Now as long as my health cooperates… I'll be one of the lucky ones too, because I am [REDACTED_NAME].

72it09,1506411036,9/26/2017 7:30,self,"Posted a while back, you all were fantastic, but...","The earthquake hit me hard (I live in Mexico City). I'm [REDACTED_NAME] fine, and so is my family, but it really got to me.

I posted a while back that I felt lonely, and many of you resonated with said post. I think many of you thought that I was depressed or sad, I wasn't. I think sadness is now creeping towards me, and I no longer have the will to get out of the way.

The appt. I lived in was deemed too dangerous to inhabit. A friend, my neighbour, has nowhere to go and has been weeping for her family's safety. She is the only one living there, currently. My mother, me and our cats have moved to my father's house. 

I guess I should be grateful, but I honestly hate every cubic inch of this place. Everything feels so... alienating, as if I was physically here but the majority of my emotions were slowly draining away; this place is slowly poisoning me, and there's little I can do about it. I hate this situation, I abhor how manipulative my father, who makes sure we only clash and never coexist with one another, is and how his cancerous ways have formed a malevolent tumor in my brother's head.

I said last time I knew what depression was, and that was because I was driven to suicidal attempts by the very same people. I've since worked towards getting better, and I did, but it seems, to me, that everything I loved has crashed and burnt. I love mixing and producing music, yet, since the quake, I've had an unbearable tinnitus. I can't focus, and everything I look at turns to a smudge, where once I saw clearly. I hear blurrily, if that makes any sense. I feel tremors and have to watch how some cables I hung don't shake to know an earthquake isn't happening. I hear the sirens blaring in the middle  of the night. There's this impending sense of relief as if there is something, a flash of blinding light, that'd immediately take me away. I know I should feel fine that I just got a superficial cut out of this and move on. Hell, my appt. is repairable, and I know many people died or have nowhere to go.

I'd given up on my relationship with my father, being the anti-Middas: everything he touches turns to complete and utter shit. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to realize that my brother has become one of those things. My father has implanted the seed of discord into my brother's head, and there's naught but disdain and resentment for us.

To contextualize this, I have to tell my story. When I was 15, a friend's mother got lung cancer. I helped her and her mother every time I could until I just couldn't anymore. I was just depleted in every sense. At the same time, I was ignored by my family, and dedicated no time towards bettering myself or talking with pretty much anyone else. I felt suicidal, and talked to my mother about it. There is something surreal in telling someone close that you want to kill yourself. 

We planned and took a trip, fueled by credit, to Europe with a friend of my mom's. Everything was so real, and I managed to see that there are more things to life other than being the perfect student for a subject you hate and living the life a full colostomy-bag imposed on you. That was my turning point and I 

So I sought and found an amazing opera singer who taught me all I know about spirituality and singing that I know. I studied under her tutoring for a couple of years and found a reason to live. In that time, I moved out of my father's place into my now-empty appt.

I loved for the very first time. I was loved as well. I finally remembered what not being empty inside felt. I knew I had cost my mother hundreds of thousands of pesos in debt, but it was all worth it. She was changed, too. There's a sublime satisfaction in changing someone's life for the better; turns out she'd tried to kill herself many times, since I was little, with complete disregard of how I'd be left alone with a leech who feasts on souls. She now had, as well, some motivation back in her life, helping me out and caring for her cats and me.

My brother, having formed a codependency with my father, stayed with him, and started growing a resentment towards us. I attribute it to me being in search of my happiness and well being. I feel he's struck mediocrity in every personal development sense. I felt, and still feel, saddened by his stunt in growth, but my mental health and potential for happiness is more important to me than anything else.

And that's what my place meant to me. It's a symbol of my will to get better; to find and value myself.

And I can't help but feel like that has just been taken away for me.

I feel like I've been stolen that, and that I've regressed all those years' development I put all my hard work into, and everything's terrible again.

I fear falling back into depression, and had to get all this ""negrura"" (blackness, I guess) out of my soul. To everyone who read this, I hope you've found happiness and can work towards it. I'll be happy for everyone who's working hard in bettering themselves.

To everyone who feels like they live in a black hole that consumes all feelings and will, you are not alone. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of you whenever I work hard to stop feeling empty, and I hope you find your way in this convoluted maze that is life.

Note: many people IRL know my handle. Nothing of this is a secret, but many things are told in passing, and lack perspective. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if you disagree with how I felt this, but this is my reality based on my perception. I may be wrong to how you see my story, but, to me, it doesn't get any more real than this.

Thoughts and prayers to everyone who's been affected by this, Harvey, Irma, Maria amongst other things. We'll prosper, I'm [REDACTED_NAME].",3,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
g4o74x,1587366981,4/20/2020 7:16,stories,My Story- From Breaking The Rules To Breaking My Back,"I had lived my life on the edge since I was 14, having no fear, no regret and never believing that my actions have consequences. I liked to drink. I liked breaking the rules. I liked that I got away with it. That was until I reached 17 and karma came back to bite me. New Years Eve is a time to celebrate and have fun. I took it one step too far that night. I changed the life that I will never get back. I was at the pub, drinking, partying and having a great time. What’s the harm in that? I was enjoying myself until I was asked to leave. Blind drunk, I walked home. Right around the corner. I unlocked the front door and climbed up the stairs to my flat. The night wasn’t over for me. I walked to the balcony, climbed over the railings and stumbled along the roof towards the awning. I had done it before. What could go wrong? Walking along the awning, looking down at everyone outside the pub, I thought I was invincible. I started to walk closer and closer to the end of the awning. I remember feeling the panic and desire to turn back. I was having too much fun to turn back. Then…. It all went dark.

I hit the back of my neck on the brick awning as I fell, legs first, 7 meters to the footpath below. The back of my head landed hard on the fuse box of the butcher’s roof, ripping the flesh away from my skull and badly splitting my skull. My spine was severed as I fell, and my tail bone and sternum were broken. Then, landing legs first on the footpath, I split my femurs on both legs and shattered my wrist and broke my tail bone as I hit down face first. 

I started to go into shock from major internal bleeding in my abdomen and brain. My legs were badly crushed. Part of my spinal cord was severed, my back broken, along with my tail bone and sternum. My wrist was snapped, separating the bones. My skull crushed so badly that the only thing keeping me alive at the time was Andrew’s hands holding it in place. He saved my life that night. My heart was beating slower and slower by the second, while I was fighting to stay alive. No pulse. No breath. No light at the end of the tunnel. Just darkness as everything got colder. An oxygen tube was put down my throat and the defibrillator turned on. THUD….. No pulse. THUD………. Nothing. My heart had stopped beating. There was no more pain and no more fear. Just as I was about to slip away from this world, with one last thud, my heart started beating again, with a pulse so weak that the only thing keeping me alive was the oxygen tube down my throat and the hand holding my skull together. From that second on, every step they took was vital to keeping me alive. Carefully putting me onto the stretcher, I was taken in the ambulance to the Orange Base Hospital, stopping only once on the way when my heart stopped beating. It was midnight when I was taken into emergency, the nurses and doctors seeing something they would only have seen in horror movies. They x-rayed me to see the extent of my injuries, stopped the bleeding, and once I was stabilized, I was airlifted by Care Flight to The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney.

That night, my father received a phone call on my behalf. “Your daughter has fallen off the roof”. He was working in Victoria at the time and had to drive 7 hours to Sydney, all the while with the thought going through his mind that I might be dead. It still hurts me to know the pain I put him through. I was placed into an induced coma for 3 weeks. My body’s fight for survival was not yet over. My veins were pumped with drugs to paralyze my muscles and keep me alive. That would not have been enough if I had lost my will to live. My heart stopped beating on a number of occasions, but I was not ready to die. A tracheotomy (breathing tube) was inserted down my wind pipe. The long tube acted as my lungs until I learnt how to breathe by myself again. My brain developed a subdural hematoma, (bleeding and swelling in the brain) and my skull had to be drilled to relieve the pressure. My father was there the whole time. My injuries were so severe that the doctors thought it best to turn off the life support, saying the best case scenario IF I was to wake up, I would be paralyzed from the neck down and severely brain damaged. My father took that the worst, telling them not to touch the machines. My brother drove 4 hours to Sydney every weekend to sit by my bed, his hand on mine. “Wake up. Please. Just wake up”. I could feel his hand some times and I wanted to squeeze back to let him know I was there. I wanted to talk and wanted to move. I didn’t know where I was or what was happening. But I was never alone. My best friends came to see me there. As I was fast asleep, they said goodbye, not knowing if I would ever wake up. I was under strong drugs to keep me in a coma while my body was recovering. After 3 weeks, the drugs I was under began to be slowly reduced to wake me up. After 5 weeks, I was stable enough to go to surgery where I was operated on for 12 hours. My femurs on both legs had developed hematomas (swollen muscle and bone growth) from being in traction for 5 weeks. Because I was bedridden for so long, my legs had begun to heal out of place and had to be re-broken for them to correctly heal. Titanium rods were inserted inside both legs from my hips to my knees. Small pins were inserted inside my broken wrist to let the break set in place. My neck had been in a brace for 5 weeks which had built a mark under my chin, leaving a permanent scar. A rod was put inside the back of my neck to hold it together. A large scar now follows down my neck where the rod was put in. My sternum was put in place to heal. There was not much that could be done to help fix the 2 fractured C4-5 vertebrae in my spine. My skull was put back in place and the torn flesh was sown back together. After spending 5 weeks in intensive care at The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, I was transferred to Royal North Shore Hospital to begin my rehabilitation. I spent 7 weeks there, having to learn everything all over again. How to talk, drink, eat, swallow, write, draw, read, and even how to smile. I remember every night there, dad by my bed side, telling me what had happened. What I had done to myself. Crying with me every night. I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I had to piece it together bit by bit, knowing that I may never walk again, and that it was all my fault. Because of that one night. “What could go wrong?” I asked myself. I had visits from friends and family while I was there. I was still recovering from post traumatic stress, so my memory of it is still quite fuzzy. I went to physio 5 days a week and the hydrotherapy pool once a week. It was the hardest and most confusing time.

After the 7 weeks at Royal North Shore, I was sent to the Royal Ryde Brain Injury Rehabilitation center. I was there for 3 months. As soon as I entered, I wanted to leave. The name of the center spoke for itself. I felt like I didn’t belong there. My friends came to visit me there which made my stay feel so much better.

After the 7 weeks at Royal North Shore, I was sent to the Royal Ryde Brain Injury Rehabilitation center. I was there for 3 months. As soon as I entered, I wanted to leave. The name of the center spoke for itself. I felt like I didn’t belong there. My friends came to visit me there which made my stay feel so much better.When I finished my rehabilitation at Ryde, my next adventure was at Moorong Spinal Rehabilitation Center. It was there that I felt like I belonged. I met a lot of interesting people there. Young men who could no longer move anything from the neck down. Amy. She was 15 and had no movement or sensation from the waist down because of a rare birth defect. Her will power and determination to fight was so strong. It gave me strength. It was people like her who helped bring me back into reality. I started to realize just how lucky I was. I lived. I have movement. I have sensation. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of the lucky ones. I did a lot of physio work while I was there. Training every day, aiming to get stronger so I could go home. I spent 3 months there, and after spending 9 months in hospital in Sydney, I got the best birthday present I could have asked for. On the 9th of October 2008, I left Sydney to go to the Bathurst Hospital. It was still hospital, but as I left, it felt fantastic watching Sydney disappear and to be one step closer to home. The air was fresher and the people were nicer. That was when the hard yards really started. I was doing physio at the Hospital every day. I went to the university twice a week to take part in an experimental exercise cycle called The Fez Cycle. It creates muscle contractions as your feet push on the cycle. It was hard work, but worth it.

As it got further and further to the end of December, the anticipation to leave was almost unbearable. A year in hospital was far too long. It was the worst year of my life. I left the Bathurst Hospital about a week before Christmas. I went to the house that my dad had built. I finally got to see everyone again. All the people I hadn’t seen all year. Those who, before, I had seen every day. I got to see my friends more often and I felt a lot more independent being away from hospital. That Christmas was the best Christmas I had ever had. 2009 was difficult, having to learn everything in a different way. Having to live a life I had never known before, life in a wheelchair. That year seemed to go so quickly.

Then it hit December. My stomach still aches to think about it. It was the 6th of December 2009. I was at home. Everything felt like a normal day. My sister was there for school holidays. It all felt fine, until my uncle knocked on the door. I’ll always remember that day. My dad had a Microlight airplane and loved to fly. He had been away working for a week. When my uncle said the words to me and my sister, my heart sunk. My dad was my world. “He crashed his plane” my uncle said. At first I didn’t want to believe him. I told myself it wasn’t true, but as the thought sunk deeper and deeper, the tears started to flow. My dad meant everything to me. He was there through everything. I remembered all the times he held my hand, telling me not to be afraid. Knowing that he was there made it all okay. We had to go to \*my family's home\* for the funeral. I had never been to a funeral before. I could still feel him holding my hand. 2010 was tough, but we all made it through. In June, I spent 2 and a half months at a nursing home until a place in my current city opened up. When the opportunity arose, I took it, diving head first into a totally new life of living by myself. It felt great. I felt free.

At the beginning of 2011, I set myself a goal. One of the hardest things I have ever set out to do. Pushing myself away from the boundaries I put myself in, I spoke to the students at a high school in Orange, telling them my story, in the hope of helping others not to repeat my mistake. My battle to survive, what I had to go through, and my life now has changed every part of me for the better. I’m still pushing the boundaries and exceeding the possibilities of the word ‘quadriplegic’. My limitations have changed but not my determination. In December 2011 my Christmas present to my family was a photo of me standing. The first time in 4 years. I have stood multiple times since then and I hope one day I can stand unassisted. Although the chance of me walking again are next to impossible, that small act of freedom in standing gives me a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. If I've achieved so much in the past 12 years, who knows what the future will bring for me?

With help from friends, family and my physiotherapist, I aim to push myself beyond what my spinal injury tells me I can do. My experience has made me stronger. Made it okay to say no. It has helped me to understand that all actions have consequences. It’s hard at times, but I take pride in living, pride in the things I have done and the things I can do now. Life is hard, but it’s worth fighting for.",14,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd always bring him home whatever he wanted (usually junk food like hot pockets, chips, etc) and I went through a huge steak phase, my family was kind of poor so we almost never got steak, it felt fancy to me. So I would go find the thickest steak we had in the cooler and change the sticker price so instead of being like $11.99lb it was $1.99lb making it exponentially cheaper. I did this probably twice a week for over a year and was never caught.",23849,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1i9pk50,1737819583,1/25/2025 15:39,self,I feel disgusted with myself because I’ve realized I am developing racist tendencies against people of Indian origin,"I really hate myself for this. This tendency is abhorrent, and I want to get rid of it because I despise it.



For context: I am a highly-educated individual who has worked with people of many nationalities and ethnicities through my job and through volunteering work—Black people, Southeast Asians, Mexicans, Ukrainians… no problem whatsoever. I always try to help in situations where my skills can make a positive difference in someone’s life.



To my utter horror, I’ve realized that an instinctive tone of prejudice has crept into my thinking when it comes to people of Indian origin. I  don’t think it has ever affected anyone directly., but I feel genuinely ashamed of myself.



Some reasons for this realization:

1. Traveling to India and witnessing people defecating in the open. Also witnessing shockingly low standards of hygiene in general. (How can anyone feel this is ok...)
2. Receiving frequent spam calls from call centers, often with that distinct Indian accent. You know what I mean: the voiceless P, K, T, etc. 



As I said, I’m horrified by this realization of my perception. I do not want to generalize, and I recognize that systemic issues may be contributing factors. For example:

3. India’s urbanization might not have kept pace with its growing population. Despite being seen as an emerging global power, a large portion of the population likely still lives in relative poverty without access to proper sanitation. So maybe it is not their fault that their hygienic standards are subpar and it is not fair to judge them from a “Western” perspective?

4. Certain corporations probably exploit India’s workforce by hiring people on low wages. People working in such jobs may have no choice but to spam others just to make a living and put food on the table. Of course they don’t care that they call this “Western” number X number of times in a week.

Cognitively, I understand these issues and am aware that there are likely other aspects I haven’t even considered as I try to contemplate the inequality.

And yet, I find myself instinctively returning to points 1 (dirty) and 2 (annoying Indian accent). I am [REDACTED_NAME] ashamed and baffled by this because I’ve never had this kind of reaction to any other nationality.

I do apologize to any Indian reading this. I suspect it must feel like a very clear case of stereotyping. 

I want to know what is wrong with me, and how to change it.

One time I was driving somewhere with my mom and stepdad, and we were talking about historical figures we would like to meet. He said he would want to meet this one guy and starts listening off stuff he had done (I can’t for the life of me remember his name or what he did because what he said next made me immediately forget all that and replaced it with “???”) and to give an example of how badass this guy was, he said, “once, he pulled a gun on two black boys for trying to use the pool.”

I was immediately like, “wait, why does that make you want to meet him?” Because the way he said that made it sound like he was impressed by it.

He then says, “well at the time, it was illegal for black people to use a white pool,” like he thinks I didn’t know what segregation and Jim Crow laws were.

And then I’m just like, “yeah but like, just because something is legal that doesn’t make it okay.”

And he just went, “well, yes… being legal doesn’t make it okay, but…” and then there was just total silence for the rest of the drive. My mom texted me later that night and said I was being rude but it’s like, what was I supposed to do??? Act like that wasn’t a weird thing to say???

—————————

There was another time, I was having lunch with my grandma, and a black girl wearing a, “black is beautiful,” shirt walked past us, and my grandma leans over to me and goes, “I don’t understand why people wear stuff like that. It just makes us *more* racist.”

I laugh and go, “wait a minute, who is *we*??? Because it’s not making *me* racist. Also why are you saying, “more racist,” like you’re comparing it to the amount of racist that you already are???”

My grandma goes, “but if I wear a shirt that says, “white is beautiful,” that wouldn’t be okay would it?”

I respond, “no, because it’s about historical context. White people were never on mass told, “oh you’re ugly because you’re white. White people are ugly,” the way black people were for like hundreds and hundreds of years.”

Then my grandma goes, “but it’s not even like that anymore. You don’t need to wear stuff like that today.”

I turn to her and go, “didn’t [my young cousin] just tell us like last week that her classmate was crying because kids were calling her a gorilla because she was black?”

She goes, “yes, I’m not saying it never happens, and it *is* sad, but when you really look at it, it’s not as bad as it used to be. People need to stop being sensitive about things like that.”

I held back from saying anything else, but I was really tempted to call out that she was calling other people sensitive when she was the one who got offended by a shirt. ",4194,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1jszv7c,1743961535,4/6/2025 17:45,stories,My dad’s deathbed confession… really wrecked us.,"Three months ago, this man, this ghost we thought had been dead for, like, twenty years... just showed up. Knocked on my mom’s door like it was no big deal.

And let me paint the picture for you: scruffy gray beard, hollow cheeks, dragging this busted, seen-too-much-shit leather suitcase like it owed him rent. My older sister Laura opened the door. She almost passed out. Legit. I thought she was gonna throw up or deck him or both.

To really get it, you gotta go back.

Mom always said our dad was a hero. A journalist locked up overseas for speaking out against some messed-up regime. Fighting for truth, freedom of the press, all that. Then, a few years later, came the news: he died in prison from untreated pneumonia. No funeral. Just a tragedy and a handful of ashes we never saw

The End. Period. That was the version we grew up with.The only one we knew.The only one we believed.

Laura? hated him. Even with the martyr story, she never forgave him for leaving. She always said: Doesn’t matter how noble the excuse,, gone is still gone.

So when she saw him standing there, all she said and voice shaking with fury, not surprise, was: You don’t get to be here.

My brother Michael? Different vibe. He’s quiet. Always thinking, always feeling more than he lets on. He stared at Dad for what felt like forever, like he was trying to figure out if this was real life or a dream. Then just asked: How’d you get out of prison? And… why now?""

Me? I didn’t even know what I felt. It wasn’t hate. Wasn’t joy either. It was like the ground disappeared under my feet. I’d built this whole version of him in my head. This myth. This tragic hero. And standing there was just… a tired old man.

For weeks, he was like a ghost floating around the edges of our lives.

Mom? Not having it. She shut that door on any second chances. SWouldn’t dig up that past she'd already buried.

So guess who took him in?

Aunt freaking Bertha. 

She said the poor guy had nowhere else to go. So, she gave him a dusty little room in the back of her house. He didn’t argue. Just nodded.

And then, one day, his body just… gave up.

The hospital ran a ton of tests. Nothing made sense. His immune system was shutting down but there was no infection, no cancer, like something inside him was rotting...

Aunt Bertha was crushed. Said he wasn’t eating. Barely slept. Claimed it was stress, guilt, all those years of hiding catching up with him. Dad kept saying his mouth felt gross. Headaches that wouldnt quit. Like something was rotting him from the inside.

Then, right before he died, he asked to see us. All of us.Not for love.Not for forgiveness, nope. Just… truth or to drop a bomb and peace out.



He could barely speak, but he was stubborn. Wouldn’t rest till he got it out.

Dad: I was in prison but Not for long, yeah, I was involved in politics. But they let me go after a few months. I didn’t come back because…(he looked at us. All three of us) because I found out you weren’t my biological kids.

Silence. My brain? Cracked

He went on.""Your mom wrote me a letter while I was locked up. Said she loved me. But she’d lied. She told me the truth in that letter.""

""I felt like everything in my life was fake. So I disappeared. I faked my death. Hid.""

He didn’t cry. He just talked. Like he’d been carrying this weight so long and now he was finally allowed to put it down.

And we just… stood there. Statues. Broken. No one said a damn word.

-§-

Edit: Update****
I think it is too long for sharing in a post (just adding another part)

After he died, things got weird. Not at first. 

Aunt Bertha called me two days after the funeral. Said she couldnt stay in the house. Said the room where he slept felt wrong and heavy. She swore she kept hearin something scratching inside the closet at night. But when she checked, nothing. Just dust and his old suitcase, still zipped up, still sitting where he left it

That thing freaked me out. Idk why. It was just a damn suitcase. But every time I looked at it, I felt like it was looking back. 

Michael opened it. That’s his thing. So he did.

There wasnt much inside. A couple of shirts, a half-used bar of soap wrapped in paper (ew), some faded photos of people we didnt recognize. And this notebook. Leather-bound. No title. Just stuffed with pages of cramped handwriting.

We took it home. Dumb idea.

The first few pages were what you'd expect. Random notes. Political crap. Names. Numbers. But then the tone shifted. Got paranoid. Obsessive. He started writing like someone was watching him. Following him. There were pages scratched out so hard the paper tore.

There was an another note, dated just a few days before he died. One of the last things he wrote:

'That night I couldnt sleep. My mouth tasted weird. Bitter. Metallic. Like I’d been chewing on aluminum foil""

Laura wanted to burn it. Straight up tossed it in the sink and lit a match. But the damn thing wouldn’t catch. It blackened around the edges but never really burned. 

The next day I went to see Mom. She looked worse than I’ve ever seen her. Like she’d aged ten years in a week.

She didnt even say hi, just stared out the window

Eventually, I got the nerve to ask her about the letter, okay, the one she sent Dad when he was in prison. The one that made him disappear.I told her I wanted the Truth. About everything and about him and about us. 

About who our father really was

Or if he was even the only one

She didnt speak. Just turned her head slowly and gave me this look cold and scared at the same time. Like she wanted to tell me, but her mouth wouldnt let her.And then she said: What the hell are you talking about? Are you high again?

And She walked away.

That night, Laura called hysterical. Said she found Michael in the bathtub. Not dead. Not bleeding. Just sitting there, fully clothed, muttering to himself...over and over:

“He wasn’t supposed to come back. He wasn’t supposed to come back”

We checked him into a clinic the next day. He hasn’t said a word since.

Now it’s just me. Me and this notebook I cannot seem to throw away. 

Well, Sometimes I think I see him. My dad. In reflections. In places he shouldn be.

Like he never left.

Like he’s still watching us

So, I went to Aunt Bertha’s place to ask her about it all. I needed answers. She let me in but there was something… off about her. Her eyes were too wide, like she hadn slept; her hands shook when she poured me a drink. She kept glancing over her shoulder, as someone might walk in.

I asked her about the suitcase. She didn answer right away. Then after a long silence, she finally spoke so soft I almost didn hear it:

“I loved him”

WHAT??

1iupgnr,1740139952,2/21/2025 12:12,confession,I let a homeless person crash in my dad's shed...when I was six.,"So when I was 6 and my cousin J was 14, we were bored of the usual backyard and indoor activities and wanted to explore but not go anywhere too far. So we decided to go look around my dad's shed. He used to always be in there fixing something, but at this point in the story it had been about two years since he's gone in there.

For a good hour or two we were exploring and playing and tinkering with anything we could find. 

We found a homeless man that was maybe 30 or 40 something sleeping in one of my dad's very old cars. 

I was a little scared, and clung to my cousin, but he just nudged him awake and attempted to make conversation. His name was Clement and he was actually very friendly. 

Call my cousin stupid for not telling my dad, but he's had friends and their relatives become homeless, and he was sympathetic, so he chose not to say a word to my dad. A little messed up because my cousin was just staying here a few weeks, and then he was gone.

I stayed though, and went into the shed every few days to color while talking to Clement. He didn't scare me. All he did was sit there in the car and talk to me and tell me stories. I was just a kid, and maybe too scared to get caught so I never got him food from the house. How on earth was he being fed, I don't know.

This went on for about five or six months and then one day I went in the shed and he wasn't there anymore.  I cried. I was so upset.  I never told my dad so I couldn't just make this story up now. And my cousin was in another state. I felt so alone, I missed him, I was worried for him. I think this was the earliest in my life I truly WORRIED about someone like that. Saw a post earlier about someone doing something similar, and it reminded me of this experience.

mzljd,1322987744,12/4/2011 8:35,offmychest,My story.,"I just want to get my story out.  It’s going to be a long post and I don’t expect it to be read.  But I just want to get it out me.  

I was born almost twenty one years ago.  My dad bailed before I was born so my mom being young, moved back home halfway across the country to live with my grandparents and they helped raise me.  My mom went to college to become a nurse.  

When I was in the fourth grade, my friend’s cousin who was only two years older than me told me about a club that he was in and told me that he wanted to initiate me into it.  I wanted to fit in so badly.  So I said okay.  He took me to the side of the house and sexually assaulted me.  I felt uncomfortable about it, but I didn’t think it was wrong.  It took a while to realize what really happened that day.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] going to go into further discussion about this topic.

My grandpa was an alcoholic.  He lost his job when I was nine.  My grandma had to go to work in his place.  He was incredibly depressed after losing his job.  He rarely left the bed and drank heavily.  Nearly a year after losing his job, he told my grandma that she should probably take him to the hospital.  He had grown so weak that he couldn’t walk to the car.  He was too tall for my grandma or mom to carry, he was about six foot and my mom and grandma are five foot six and five foot four.  My mom sent me out to the neighbors house.  The neighbor kids asked me what was happening and if he was going to die.  I don’t remember what I said.

I remember visiting him in the hospital.  One day I thought he was getting a lot better because when I walked in he called me by my nickname, something he hadn’t done in a long time, and I was so happy that he was going better I started crying tears of joy.

Two weeks after being submitted to the hospital he died from liver failure.  We didn’t have a funeral, having recently filed for bankruptcy. 

The rest of that year was a blur.  I was bullied a lot.  It started because for class we watched Where The Red Fern Grows and I started crying because of deaths.  My grandpa was a huge sucker for dog movies and I was still struggling with the concept of death.  My teacher pulled me aside to talk about it.  My friend and her friend wrote me an email calling me pathetic for crying at the movie and told me I was poorly dressed and that they didn’t want to be my friend anymore.  I spent a lot of that year alone.  My grades suffered greatly.  

Things got a lot better during sixth grade.  I made friends and was doing a lot better.  My grandma moved to live with my great-grandmother, which I was okay with.  I missed her, but I was fine.

My mom was severely depressed for a while.  I didn’t realize it at the time.  She took care of my grandma when my grandpa had died and she was the one who called everyone and she didn’t really get time to grieve.  

I suffered from low self-esteem in middle school.  I started burning and cutting myself in ninth grade.  I went through long bouts of suicidal thoughts.  I was once ready to do it, but my mom came home early from work that day and I realized what I was about to do, so ran outside and hugged her, crying.  She asked me why I was crying, I told her I just missed her.  

I started talking to my dad when I was fourteen.  We met when I was fifteen.  We talk infrequently because he’s in and out of jail for DUIs quite a bit.  

My junior year was the first I had been happy in a long time.  I liked my job, I had a great group of friends and I was even on honor roll.  I was happy for about six months.  Then one day it just came crashing down.  Nothing really changed except I was happy, and then I wasn’t.  My mom realized what was going on this time and took me the counselor that she went to when she was depressed.  I was put on an anti-depressant.  It didn’t make me happy, but made me feel like I could be happy one day.

My senior year didn’t start out well.  I was supposed to visit my dad, but I had to cancel the trip because he was arrested for failure to follow court orders after his previous DUI charge.  My friends had started getting into drinking and smoking pot.  The anniversary of my grandfather’s death was coming up.  My friends started drinking and I freaked out because of my dad’s DUI and my grandpa’s alcohol-related death and had to be taken home by a sober friend there when I was supposed to be spending the night.  

While my Dad was in jail he sent me the lyrics of “Hate Me” by Blue October.  

I told my mom about why I came home early.  She and one of my friend’s moms were talking about it one day and there was a misunderstanding.  Group of friends started bullying and excluding me.  I went through another suicidal period.  I made good friends with one of my coworkers.  He helped me out a lot during that time.  He’s still one of my closest friends.  I stopped cutting and burning myself.

I spent my lunches during my senior year hanging out with various teachers.  Teachers have always liked me which I thought was odd because I’ve never been great at turning in school work.  But that’s where I spent my time.

I went to university near me after I graduated.  I moved into the dorms and I was doing okay.  My Dad and I were talking again and I visited him before I started college.  I did poorly in my classes.  I’m still ashamed of this.  My mom took me back to the counselor.  I was diagnosed with ADD.  

I began dating someone whom I had a crush on since I was sixteen.  Things were great for a while, but then he grew distant and cold.  We dated for a couple months and broke up.  Then we got back together a month later.  I switched to a community college because I still didn’t know what I wanted to do and didn’t want to waste any more money just drifting through college classes.  I was not doing well.  I was going through another suicidal period and told the boyfriend.  He didn’t do anything about it.  He then used me to get off.  That was the last time I saw him.  I saw my counselor again.  She told me to break up with him asap.  I tried getting ahold of him, but I couldn’t.  So I wrote him a letter and packed up his stuff and left it on a box on his doorstep.

I struggled with things for a while, but after a while I was doing a lot better.  I haven’t talked to my Dad in over nine months.  His phone has been disconnected and I haven’t got another way to reach him.

I have a great set of friends.  My mom is dating someone who is a nerd and got me involved with his rpg-ing group.  I brought my coworker friend and the nine to eleven of us play Pathfinder every week.  I reconnected with some of my better friends from high school.  Over all, I’m not complaining too much about life right now.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] introverted and introspective because of how  much time I spent alone growing up.  I’m comfortable that way.  I’ve dated a bit since my ex, but nothing significant.  I’m pretty self-sufficient.  I use humor as a way of coping with things.  It takes a while for me to trust people.  Men a little bit more than women.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] better about letting people get closer to me.  ",7,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After another bit of teasing about “how I pulled a man like that” I sat in our car and thought about it. He really IS out of my league.

1b1ca56,1709041765,2/27/2024 13:49,TrueOffMyChest,I’ve only just realized that I let the men I call my family and friends ruin my marriage    ,"

I’ve been divorced for almost 2 years and a few weeks ago my father (67m), my 2 brothers (37m&40m) and 4 friends (35m,37m,38,41m) while very drunk joked about how they can’t believe I left my wife. They said that they all tried to get with her since the divorce but she had repeatedly rejected them, saying it would be inappropriate and unkind to do such a thing to me.

I laughed at what they were saying just to ease them into saying more and once they thought I found it funny they really opened up. They had all purposely made me feel paranoid about my ex-wife cheating on me, and using me because why would a woman like her be with a man like me if it wasn’t for the money I made? They often hinted at or sometimes even directly said that she wore the pants in the relationship and that she was only with me because I’m easily manipulated. They constantly planted negative things into my mind. If I went to talk with them about something happening in my relationship they would put a negative twist to it or they’d purposely give me bad advice. Then when I lost my job during covid they all hinted at how she’s definitely cheating now that there’s no financial benefit in being faithful to me. I obviously trusted them and often took their words to heart and it ruined my marriage. 

I frequently argued with my wife and I was always accusing her of something or suspecting her of not really loving me. I questioned everything that was between us. I often told her bullshit things like how I’m a high value man and that she needed to appreciate me and when I was not working for 6 months I flipped the script and started accusing her of not respecting me for not working. I was unappreciative of all her hard work and for being the one who took care of our household bills and any other bill during those six months of unemployment. I continued to let their words drive me into paranoia and I started accusing her of cheating with her co-workers. 

Eventually my wife had enough of my moods, constant mistrust and accusations. She left me and to be honest for a long time it felt like it came out of nowhere and so I had myself convinced she left me for another man.

Now here I am [REDACTED_NAME] that every man I’ve called my family, my friend were all my enemies who I let destroy my marriage. I obviously lost my mind once they were done telling me all the ways they conspired to ruin my marriage, and we did get to blows. I’ve cut off all contact with each and everyone of them. 

I want to reach out to my ex and make amends and hopefully get her back. My ex-wife has agreed to meet up with me and she doesn’t know exactly what I want to discuss with her and I don’t know how to go about making amends and hopefully mending our relationship. How do I tell her how much I regret everything and that I want her to give me a second chance? Is there even a chance for us? 


Edit: Some of y’all keep saying “you took the words of your friends over your wife’s” and I don’t think that’s a to fair or complete assessment. I trusted my father and brothers. My father was the main driving force behind this manipulation campaign and it’s not often that your entire family is conspiring against you. And not only your family but also your friends. 

I’m not running away from accepting the fact that it is wholly my fault in how my marriage ended. I take ownership of that. I take ownership of the fact that I accused my wife of being a cheater or a user. I regret it all.

If my ex-wife doesn’t accept my apology. I would accept it gracefully. If she said she never wanted to talk to me or ever get back together I’d also accept it. I would not stand in the way and I would not try to change her mind. I would wish her well and leave her be. ",4853,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1jdhssi,1742231168,3/17/2025 17:06,stories,I secretly recorded my professor making sexist remarks and got him fired!,"I (26M) am in my final year of university, and I had a professor let's call him, Dr. R, who always made weird, inappropriate comments. At first, I thought he was just old-fashioned, but over time, I realized he was blatantly sexist.

It started subtly, he would call on male students more often and dismiss female students' answers as ""lucky guesses."" But as the semester went on, his comments became worse. He once said in class, ""Women just aren’t as naturally gifted in logic-based subjects,"" and another time, when a girl asked a question, he laughed and said, ""If female students spent less time worrying about their looks and more time studying, maybe they’d get better grades."" Whenever we had a difficult topic, he’d smirk and say, ""This might be a little hard for the girls, but don’t worry, just smile at your lab partners, and they’ll help you out.""

Then one day, he completely crossed the line. A girl in my class wore a tank top because it was hot outside, nothing inappropriate, just normal summer wear. He paused the lecture and said, ""Wow, dressing like that for extra credit? Bold strategy."" Some people laughed awkwardly, but the girl looked mortified. She barely spoke for the rest of the class.

That was when I decided to start recording. Over the next few weeks, I captured multiple instances of him making sexist comments. The worst was when he joked that women should focus on ""easier"" fields because STEM was ""too stressful for them."" That one pissed me off because there were girls in the class working their asses off, and he was acting like they didn’t belong there.

I compiled everything and submitted it anonymously to the university’s disciplinary committee. They launched an investigation, and within a month, Dr. R was fired.

Now, some of my classmates, mostly the guys, are pissed at me. They say I ""ruined a man’s career over a few jokes"" and that I should have just ignored him. But a lot of the female students have thanked me, saying they’ve been uncomfortable in his class for years.

&#x200B;

People wished me a happy birthday (the standard ""happy birthday text/Facebook wall post, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for that) but no one came to hang with me to just eat (multiple people were invited). I don't expect gifts, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] old to throw a fit but it's difficult not to feel the goddamn void of people when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] eating alone in my apartment, especially after two days ago we just celebrated another friend's birthday, with a surprise birthday party(we're all vaccinated), gifts and drinking. Its been like this for 3 years now. 

Maybe I'm [REDACTED_NAME] friend that people just tolerate but don't really like. 

The pizza and crepes are good though. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for that. 

Next year I'm [REDACTED_NAME] gonna travel by myself to another country.

Edit: signed back on to having the post blow up. 
I’m sad that so many of you know exactly how it feels and I’m sorry you’ve had this happen. Next year let’s all have a better birthday! Thank you all for the birthday wishes.

Edit 2: 
I can’t respond to everyone so thank you for all the wishes and empathy and advice. I felt very alone today and you’ve all made me feel better. I appreciate you and wish all of you better birthdays",42652,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1583hm7,1690183906,7/24/2023 7:31,TrueOffMyChest,My Step-Father Abused Me and Got Away with Everything... Why am I the One Who Has to Pay?,"Unfortunately, there is no TL;DR for this. I want to get everything out there, and I don't want to dilute the story at all. Everything must be told, and if you are willing, everything must be read.

Most names have been changed, so if you know who the actual person is that is referenced, please be respectful of their privacy.

\*\*\*TRIGGER WARNING: Detailed mentions of child abuse and sexual assault.\*\*\*

This account will be as objective as possible, telling my story as I remember it without exaggeration. As far as I remember, everything \*really\* started when I was 9 years old (I am [REDACTED_NAME], by the way). We moved around a lot, and I try to remember my age through events and where we lived, but I don't have the best recollection for that particular moment. I mean, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my own memory has distorted itself some because this really is not something people would want or even choose to remember. Honestly, I already know losing part of my memory would drive me crazy, but sometimes I wish I were one of those lucky people that could block out their memories.

I've made some poor decisions in my life, to include skipping class because I hadn't completed an assignment, and doing so little work in the seventh grade, that I had to do it all again. Only, this time, I would be sent back to live with my grandmother. She is a loving person, and the only reason I was sent to live with her was because I hated wearing uniforms in school, so going back to a school I hadn't been to since I finished the second grade was my punishment for the actions I regret while I was in school. If I had put even a little effort into school, my life would probably be several times better... But back to the important parts - I can rant about my failings to set up my future and my desires at some other time.

A little time had passed, since I had gone back to live with my grandmother, and two of my cousins had come to stay. We'll call them Jen (12f), and Andy (9f or 10f). I was 13 at this time. (I don't remember if they were just visiting, or if they had come back for school, too. They were moved around quite a bit like I was.) I know it had been at least a couple months because I had had my first boyfriend (Marty), gone through a breakup, and was with a second boyfriend (Art). For clarity, Marty and I didn't do anything but hang around each other all the time after we started dating, but we never even held hands. My grandmother worked at this Pre-K through eighth grade elementary school, and there was only one class' worth of students for each grade. Marty had broken up with me simply because he didn't want to get me into trouble, as the school was a small one where everybody knew everyone else, and word had already started to spread about us dating - which I was strictly not allowed to do at that age. A little while later, Art came along. All we did was hold hands when we walked around and pecked each other hello and goodbye and the beginning and end of the school days - nothing more.

My then stepfather, Uriel Antonio 'Tony' Juan Ramirez-Salazar (or any other combinations of this name, he has a couple 'unofficial' names due to his Mexican heritage but was going Tony Salazar last I saw), had been abusing me for some time now. Physical, mental, sexual - you name it, it happened. When I was away from home where he couldn't do anything, he would call once every day or every couple days. Even a state away, I couldn't be free of his perversion, and I just couldn't stay comfortable. He would ask gross things like ""Who is your husband? Who is your boyfriend? Who is your daddy?"" (and yes, he would say all those in the same call) expecting me to answer, ""You.""

After all this time, I finally had the gall to do something, anything, even if it was small. No one else was home, but e and my two cousins. I thought they might get a kick out of hearing how stupid the phone call with Tony was, if nothing else. However, once the phone call ended, Jen took a second to look at me and asked, ""Is your dad a molester?"" I had no words to confirm or deny anything. I just broke down crying. It was hard to come to terms with everything finally starting to happen, but my cousins were there comforting me, and that helped. With the two to back me up, I told my grandmother, and she called my mom in the state over. I don't remember at what point the police were called, but everything began to happen so quickly.

I was taken back home where my mom and Tony were to help in the investigation that were being conducted. I told the officers \*everything.\*

\- How he had been abusing me for years. I would do something he wouldn't like, and Tony was a big fan of corporal punishment. Sure, half of the time I was guilty, kids misbehave (especially if they don't trust adults to care for and protect them - big shocker), but the other half of the time, I did nothing wrong. Tony came into this marriage with 3 other kids (16f, 15f, and 8m) and 100% had the mindset of 'you're not my blood, so I won't treat you like my children deserve to be treated.' He never said that, but he never needed to for me to get it. I was always told ""no"" for everything I had to go to him to ask, too, so I always had my younger brother (the 8yo) ask him in my stead. It was mostly to play video games or go out and play, something like that. He would also make me look like a liar in front of my own mother. He would say things like ""turn off the TV, finish your food, etc."" Of course, I was a bit of a drama queen, so I would cry a bit which caused my mom to come over and ask what was wrong. When I told her, he would say things like, ""No, I said 'turn down the TV, you don't have to finish the food if you don't like it, etc.'"" saying that I just couldn't understand him because of his accent (native Mexican Spanish speaker, but knew conversational English well). He would also come after me for things he misplaced - his wallet/money, construction tools for home/work, and whatever else.

\- How the sexual abuse had started. Tony would often tell me that if my mother asked me to go to the store with her, to tell her no and stay home (I think there were other places, too, but I distinctly remember the times she went to the store). (And she still denies this to this day, saying that she would ""never leave me alone with a grown man,"" but maybe that's her way of blocking out her own memory and trying to convince herself she wasn't at fault in any part here.) He would take me into the closet in the master bedroom where he and my mom stayed and would play a weird ""game"" with me. He would put something over my eyes to blindfold me or just tell me to close my eyes so I couldn't see anything. The ""game"" was where he would put something in my mouth, which I was told would either be a carrot or a weenie/hot dog meat. If not one of those, he would put something disgusting in my mouth that would make me gag. (After a few times of this, I started to suspect what it was - his penis). I wouldn't guess at that, but I would ask what it was or say something about how gross or weird it tasted, and he would say something like it was the gum he was chewing around the hot dog or around his finger - which was not an option, by the way???

\- How it escalated. Eventually, he was like, alright you already know what it is, and I know you've figured it out. So he started making me perform oral sex on him. It was even worse because I have a sensitive gag reflex. It was so bad, I remember vomiting up ramen soup once, and once everything was out, he still made me keep going. Some time after that, he'd move on to rubbing his penis between my legs. It wasn't long until he had moved onto inserted himself in me and having vaginal sex. All of this was within the span of a year, so the rest of that time until I had said something would be him having vaginal sex with me. He also used it as his 'punishment' whenever I didn't do something he wanted or did anything I wanted without consulting him, all the while no one else in the family knew. He even made me listen in on him at the door of the master bedroom having sex with my mom once. (As if I didn't hear them enough times when I was sleeping in the room next to them, or the room next to that.) I became more petrified as time passed because I had started my period by the time I had reached age 12, and there was no form of contraception involved. I DID NOT want to become pregnant, and I was so scared because of the possibility. Thankfully, that sort of thing didn't happen.

She had also taken me to a doctor at some point - I don't really remember before or after which event, so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it in here. My own mother... had taken me to a specialist to get my hymen checked - to see if it was still there or not. We went back into the car, and I was nervous. My mother was furious, and she hadn't said anything to me just yet. Finally, she had told me that my hymen was still intact. To her, that meant I was still a virgin. To me, who didn't know anything either, that meant I was still a virgin. Upon hearing this news, something snapped inside me. I truly felt as if I was insane in that moment. I was questioning every aspect and every moment of my life then. Was I imagining everything in the past several years? Was my mind in a completely different space than my body was? Am I crazy? Where did the past few years of my life go? Where did these memories come from if they didn't really take place? Why is this happening to me? (I learned - maybe 3 years later when I was 16 - in my health class in summer school, two very distinct details I will never forget. 1 - Some people are actually born without hymens. 2 - Some people have what are called 'flexible' hymens, which means that they either break after multiple times, or could possibly never break. I was definitely very pissed when I found out about this, that I had been wronged by people - and a medical professional, no less - who didn't even know anything. Of course, I couldn't bring this up to my mother - the one person who was supposed to believe me but was so against me at the time I needed her most. How could I?)

What didn't help was my bit of excitement on the site about still dating Art, even though I had left. The 15f who was my sister (but she was a young girl from a broken family, so of course she wanted to try to find ways to defend her father) was the one I gushed to about it. Of course, she told my mother when this all broke out, and it made me look worse in the situation. I lied about it and denied it because I knew it wouldn't help to be truthful. Like it mattered anyway... Even when I was telling the truth, it was a lie...

Now, back to what was going on with Tony--

Unfortunately, although I had poured everything out to the investigators, they didn't have any physical evidence to use against Tony. He was already being held in prison/jail during this time, though, so I was thankful for that. I remember my mother being irate when she told me that Tony had been sent to the infirmary. I was a little scared because, of course, it was 'because of me' he had gotten beat up. I accused him of being what he was, and those people where he was didn't take too kindly to pedophiles, I suppose. Anyway, my mother was on the phone with him, telling me to talk to him, and to stop lying and to tell the truth (this from the person who always like to throw in my face the phrase ""the truth always comes out""; well, I guess it can go back in if you want to bury it so badly). So, Tony came up with this ruse while we were on the phone. He was telling me to just lie to the cops/detectives and to just say I did all this because I was jealous that my sister (his kid) had gotten so much attention for the quinceñera (Mexican/Hispanic culture sweet sixteen, but at 15) she had just had a few months back.

Side note, my mother also told me I needed to apologize to my grandmother and great-grandmother, who I was staying with when this all started. She said I needed to show that I was sorry for what I did and to explain why I did it to them. Of course, I never did. I never could. It was heartbreaking enough to have gone through all this, I couldn't lie about it more. I couldn't dig myself deeper into a hole of 'this never happened.' It did happen, and I couldn't figure out why I was the only one being punished. (I'll come back to this a bit later...)

So, that's what I did. I couldn't take anymore of no one finding evidence. I couldn't take anymore of feeling like my mother loved some man so much more than me that she would yell at me and fight with me to no end just to make it all stop. The one woman who was supposed to protect me, who should have believed me, was on his side... Honestly, I wished the cop that had spoken to me at the end would have fought a little more, but there probably wasn't anything else he COULD do. But he looked at me and asked if I was sure I wanted to take it all back. He said the details of my story were not like any story he had heard (mainly talking about that disgusting closet game), and that when they had called my cousins, they confirmed that the story I had told about the phone call with Tony saying that gross stuff to me was real. I just said that it was a joke we shared, and that I was just super creative, so I was able to come up with all those stories.

After that, he came back home. The investigation was over.Tony took me aside to be alone and begged me for forgiveness. He cried to me like he was the true victim in all this. Of course I didn't want to forgive him. I never have... But I knew if I didn't say what he wanted to hear that he wouldn't leave me alone. So I said I forgave him just to make him go away as quickly as I could.

The penetration had stopped, but he never ran out of ideas. After I took my showers, he would come to me and say that he needed to check to make sure I lotioned up my body well. He would even tell me that my mother had said this was okay or that she knew about it already - something to that effect. He would still touch me sensually all over my body, paying particular attention to the areas I wanted his attention the least. But what could I do? I had lost, and I felt I had no one that could \*or would\* save me from this. After several times of this, I finally broke down crying during one of those times. Again, he also began crying and trying to play the victim. However, I think he had become nervous that I might expose him again because he had finally stopped. I was either still 13 or had just turned 14, and it was finally over. Well, the physical part was...

Things I Learned About Tony's Past Long After...

\- Tony had a drug problem. Once he and my mom had my baby brother, who's 10 years younger than I am, Tony called him his ""little angel."" Because his son was his savior from drug use and abuse. (haha But apparently nothing could make him any less of a sick pig.)

\- Tony had already cheated on my mother (at least once from what I remember) with his ex-wife.

\- Tony had given my mother chlamydia (which really freaked me out because he could have given me that). However, when she told me it happened when I was a lot younger (than when everything with him happened), I felt a bit more relieved.

Tony's Aftermath...

Tony's job for as long as I had known him had been under-the-table construction work. So he went out of town quite a bit. When I was 15/16, my mother had discovered Tony had been cheating on her with some woman in a town about 4 hours away for 2 years. Interesting how the time lines up like that... There's also a bit of irony there because the entire time he was doing all that to me, he would constantly be yelling at home about her being late (she is still a workaholic who always works late) and that she's probably off cheating with some guy. Of course, everything blew up and they got a divorce.

The Aftermath with My Mother...

11 years. It took me 11 years after being shut down and thinking I had become psychotic to finally talk to my mother about this. I thought this would finally help with my mental health. Little did I know, it only became worse every time it happened.

I was home for a visit. I finally told her that everything that happened with Tony wasn't a lie, and that it actually happened. I kid you not, the words out of her mouth were, ""Oh, honey... You still think about that?""

I was stunned. She hugged me as I broke into tears, but I couldn't find anything in me to fight back or to say anything about it. Do I still think about that? The trauma over several years that was forced onto me? The trauma that I had to face \*alone\* for the majority of my life? Of course I still thought about it!

I was so angry when I went back home. I felt relieved to finally bring it up to her, but what she said and how she said it made me feel like she was dismissing the entire traumatic experience that I had to live through right under her nose. Dismissing that she left me to fend for myself against a predator who got away with everything and walked away without consequence. When I brought it up to her at home, she said she knew or she figured out over the years that it had happened because Tony kept bringing it up for some reason. (They were still in touch because my baby brother would go visit him every now and then. My mother was also the one who handled all the paperwork in the family. As a people-pleaser, I guess she still couldn't resist helping him with whatever paperwork and things he needed after everything Tony had done to her...)

She never reached out to apologize for doubting me or take accountability for not protecting me or taking my side like a parent should have. She never reached out to say I was right. She never reached out to apologize for the several times over the years that she would ask me ""why I did it"" or ""when was I going to apologize to my grandmothers..."" I guess when you're someone who always thinks you're right, even when you're wrong, you can't seem to admit when your at fault. But whatever, that's not my problem, I guess.

3 years later, still. Even after all that... I was still in turmoil. Why had my mother dismissed me? Why is she acting like I didn't go through something so terrible that it wouldn't leave a scar on my life. I was told I was a drama queen as a child, throwing tantrums at little things and what-not. Now, even as an adult, because of that, my emotions had never been taken seriously in my family. Every cry or outburst was seen as attention-seeking and dramatic. Even now, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] silenced because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and everyone in my family can't help but talk over the other. I get it. It's the way they learned to argue and talk growing up. I was always yelled at for ""talking back"" (you know, what it's always called whenever a child tries to defend themself) and taught that that was bad behavior. So, when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I don't want to talk anymore. If it's once, I might try again. If it's more than once, then what's the point? You're already showing me that you won't listen. You don't have the right to get mad just because I've chosen not to talk now. This is also part of what my mother would call my ""180s,"" where there would be a shift in my mood. I would be fine, and the next minute I wasn't. Well, okay. Did you ever think to ask why? Did you ever think that maybe something happened in that one minute that I was reacting to? No. I was just yelled at for making a scene or being a drama queen. It didn't matter that something happened. It felt more that it mattered that I ruined the mood.

So, I got drunk really drunk for the first time in my life back in February and called her around 3-5 in the morning. I had to spill my guts out to her. I keep trying to think of a way to properly explain everything to her to make her understand exactly what I went though but finally realized after the call ended that I probably never will be able to. She didn't go through everything I went through and nothing else will ever be able to make it clearer. I also felt guilty after the call. I woke her up in the middle of the night to dump everything on her. She told me she doesn't know how to help me, and I can't really think of anything. I think the only real thing I wanted from her was to admit she was wrong and that she should have prioritized my safety over everything else she was worried about then.

I was distraught. Since then, I had recorded so many videos and had tried to write this stuff out so many times. However, they were always during breakdowns and episodes, so I would delete or trash them after. I've been so anxious of the consequences and whatever will come from this. But you know what? That should have never been a problem I should've been made to face to begin with.

Why am I doing this? Why now?

I feel like I have suffered so much because of this. I never got to have a real childhood, and it's hard to grow up and act like an adult now because of it. No one takes me seriously because I can't help but act like a child, being meek and complaining about small things. That's fine. I understand it's not their fault, that's just how I have presented myself. But if I am [REDACTED_NAME] going to pass over this wall, I need to do what is going to help me first.

I've pulled at every last straw I possibly could, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] so utterly broken and may never be the better for it if I don't put this out there. I've confided in friends, I've talked to family about it, and I've seeked help from mental health professionals/therapists and life counselors on multiple occasions. I've used writing and music as an outlet. And as much as I love them all and truly appreciate that they're in my life, I've also used my friends and co-workers as distractions. Nothing seems to help...

I've only had one truly frightening PTSD experience that I never wish to have again. About a two/three months ago, I was lying down for sleep, and after a while, I felt like I could see Tony hovering over my body. I freaked out and left the room. It happened again the next night, and the second time, I could also feel sensations on my leg as if he were rubbing his hands all up and down them. Thankfully, nothing like that has happened since, but for the few nights following, I was terrified to go to sleep.

\- To you, specifically... I've never hated you, not once in my life. Yes, I told you I wanted to tell my baby brother about it. I wanted to wait until I was ready, yes, but I also wanted to wait until I felt \*he\* was ready. You told him what happened with Tony, without my knowledge or permission. How DARE you take that from me. You want to know how to help? Stop talking about it. Stop talking about me. Quit telling everyone about my life, especially the personal details that I might not want them to know. For such a people-pleaser, it feels like you never seem think how the things you do will affect my life. Stop helping. People want to ask about me? Send them to me, then.

\- Not only that; you're still not setting the story straight! You didn't tell him what his father did to me. You only told him that I \*accused\* Tony. Even to this very day, it still seems like you're defending him over me. And what really boggles my mind is that you are still friends with this man. What am I doing wrong? Why am I not enough?

\- And most of all, how dare you do that to my baby brother. He wasn't ready for that. You sent him out into the world with that when he's the most vulnerable. He just joined the military - who already have such high suicide rates. A Marine killed himself when we were in tech school, and I don't want that to be my brother. You never had the right to lay something so heavy on him like that while he is leaving home - \*as an 18-year-old,\* - to go out into the world on his own.

\- I will thank you, though. Thank you for removing the biggest hurdle I have had in recent years in exposing my rapist.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, the last time I checked, the statute of limitations was long up, so nothing of legal repercussion can be done anymore...

I am [REDACTED_NAME] this now because this is the only thing left I can think of to keep me from further disaster. I had to suffer for something that was done to me, and the perpetrator never had to face consequences. How does that seem right? I know this is going to blow up in my face. I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to face backlash because that's what always happens. Only, now Tony can't escape. His name and face is all over the internet. I want everyone to know what he's done to me. This is his punishment.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] this now because my trauma and my unwellness bleeds into the relationships of those I grow close to. It has affected every aspect of how I react to things and it affects my relationships negatively. I feel like all I do is make those close to me miserable. Thankfully, I have someone who truly loves me and is willing to help me through the bad times. In exposing everything I have gone though, I am [REDACTED_NAME] that this weight will finally lift from my shoulders and bring me relief for once.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] it today because when everything came out, I was told I had ruined Christmas. Fine, then. How about I \*actually\* ruin it for you this year. And, yes, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] mad about it. I have every right to be upset about everything that happened.

I also have several beautiful nieces now and friends who have beautiful children. Take this as a lesson to listen to your kids when they tell you they are being abused. Sure, in some cases, a child might lie about something like that for some stupid reason. However, when they are telling the truth and truly need you to protect them, don't fail your children. This man has not even been registered as a sex offender from what I could find, so even as grown women, be careful around him. And protect your fucking children, for fuck's sake.

And for those of you who want to keep me silenced-- Go ahead. Report the post or do whatever else it is you feel you need to. This is not the only place I've spoken out. Welcome to the Digital Age.

...

I've said my piece, and this is all I want to talk about it. It's caused enough stress and anxiety on me finally deciding to put it all out there. I don't want to answer the same questions over and over and constantly think about everything once it's out. I just want this to finally be over and done with.

To anyone who may be worried, this is not a goodbye post or anything of that nature. No, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] fine, and I won't lie about it here, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] in danger. Unfortunately, I will still be here for some time to come.

You can comment or DM me all you want, but understand that I will not answer until I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. It might take any amount of time, or I may never answer. I am [REDACTED_NAME] obligated to answer.

I understand that some in my family may want to lash out for whatever their reasons may be. Say what you want, ask your questions, but I may not answer. Especially if I am [REDACTED_NAME] accused of things that are not true that you want to believe. I am [REDACTED_NAME] obligated to answer.

1bpqf9r,1711614288,3/28/2024 8:24,TrueOffMyChest,Honoring the man who almost ended me,"Avid consumer of Reddit stories, but haven’t done too many posts before so here we go, Redditors. This is going to be a long one.
This is a true story about fate and I hope it can enrich your lives as it has mine. 

When I was 16 y/o, my parents and I were involved in a bad accident. It was the day after Christmas and I wanted to go hang out at my friend’s house after spending the last several days with my family for the holidays. My parents weren’t too eager to go back out into the slushy mess rapidly accumulating on the roads, but I pestered them and finally persuaded them into letting me stay the night over at my friend’s place. 
I was so excited to get there; plans to stay up late playing video games and not having to worry about school the next day… you know… classic 16 y/o mentality. I was so darn excited that I didn’t even bother putting on my jacket before running out the door and getting into the car (this detail will be important in a moment). 

My parents decided they’d take me and grab the local newspaper from the convenience store while they’re out to further justify the decision. I was just pleased to’ve gotten my way. We hit the road and I was buckled in the back seat, passenger side (R rear seat) behind my mom. My dad was driving and we were hardly on the road for a minute before my mom turns around and tells me in classic “mom fashion” to put on my jacket. I unbuckle my seatbelt and reach down towards the floor of the back seat behind my dad, when I hear my mom shout my dad’s name. I look up to see a pair of headlights directly in front of us; yards… no… feet away, and coming at us quick! Crash. 

It all went dark. This was the only time in my life I’ve ever been KOed. I came to looking at the ceiling of the car. I’m lying between my parents. The deployed airbags to both sides of my head. My back achy as I peel myself off the decimated center console between the front seats. We were all alive, but we weren’t safe and we weren’t alright by any means.
This was the first time I’ve ever been hit so hard… undoubtably concussed. I ask my parents if they’re okay. 
My mom had suffered some pretty bad whiplash (and had more medical issues later that most likely resulted from this accident), but otherwise, my mom was the same, sharp witted and even sharper tongued hardass she’s always been. Just rattled. 
My dad wasn’t doing well. The car had been smashed in pretty badly on his side and his L leg was trapped inside the crushed front of the car. Piecing together the events that’d just unfolded while calling emergency services, my dad had swerved in the attempt to avoid a direct collision and was consequently trapped within the vehicle. He’s always been my best friend and my hero, but he’s the bravest and kindest person I’ve ever met in my life. Replaying the scene in my head… I should’ve been ejected from the car. We were going around 45mph and I assume the other car was going about the same. I have no doubt that my dad’s evasive maneuvers are what saved my family that night. 

After being struck head on, we were struck on the side of our car and pushed up the road 30 yards or so. Witnesses behind our car, including the second car that’s struck us said that our vehicle was launched into the air slightly before being hit again and pushed down the road instead of into the nearby ditch. We somehow all survived. 
The emergency responders wanted to Mercy flight my dad to the nearest intensive care hospital after cut him out of the car. My mom and I were injured but not even close to the degree my dad was, so we took a very brief ambulance ride to our nearby hospital. Remember the slushy weather? Yeahhh... My dad had to get driven to that hospital an hour away because the conditions weren't great for flying. Tough as nails, that guy. 

I remember this night so vividly. I remember the sound of me resetting my nose after I came to and the intense odor of airbag dust and my own blood. I remember my dad's scream as it still brings me to tears nearly an entire lifetime later. I remember the faces of the first responders who're there and helping my family get the medical attention we needed following the accident. A few of them were classmates of mine (shout out to you, Nick and Steph; thank you so much again and wishing you guys the happiest of lives full of meaning and purpose). I remember the paramedics that brought us to the hospital and how my mom told me to be quiet after the sixth time I thanked them for their assistance with this whole situation and accident.

Now for the other drivers...
The second car to strike us had a few people in it that immediately sprung to action. The driver almost made a crucial error when he approached our car and admitted to my dad (who is in agony and actively being skewered) that he's the one who struck us. My dad in almost swung at him when he admitted to that before realizing that he was too put together to've been the driver of the car who stuck us head on. Thank you to those in the second car and for your assistance in trying to clear up any confusion following the events of that evening. l
Finally... The gentleman who was driving the car, driving on the wrong side of the median and going east on the westbound lane. That gentleman was a father of two young children who he left behind that night when he decided to drive home after spending a little too much time at the bar. His BAC was over 3 times the legal limit, so color me impressed that he even managed to find his keys, his car, get the car started and keeping it between the lines... Just unfortunately going the wrong way. He made a mistake that night and he paid the ultimate price with his life. 

Since then, my family has gotten stronger and closer, although it took some time and maturing from multiple parties. My guilt is still something I deal with to this day. I felt responsible for why my parents had suffered and were even in that situation that night. If I hadn't pestered them then we wouldn't've ever been on the road that evening. I felt unworthy of life for some time. I wasn't looking at my glass as half full at all. I had a lot of issues before the accident, and a sure as hell had a lot more afterwards. I suffered from chronic pain, which didn't help my mental health, making me more miserable. How could I even begin to see my glass as anything but half empty? I convinced myself I was a victim and I wasn't going to be anything other than that. It was my identity. I would introduce myself to people and then cringily tell them about my heavy baggage and how I live with chronic pain following my accident. 16 y/o had a lot of annoying tendencies (shoot, present me has a lot of annoying tendencies). Present me wishes I could've given past me some tough love or some words of encouragement, but they probably would've been wasted on me. 

I was lost but was college bound but had no idea what I wanted to do... so I settled on a hobby/skill I was gifted at; Art and Design. This is the part of the story where I find my passion for art and how I become the greatest modern day artist known globally, right? No. I immediately realized that I hated having to do designs for work. It wasn't fun for me and I was lacking purpose and meaning. 
It wasn't too far into my freshman year when I met a Dr. who was a guest lecturer at my college. His message was captivating and his energy was palpable. Here's this guy who is making a difference in people's lives and helping them pursue healthier lifestyles. He and his wife run this wellness clinic and I started taking control of my health and committed myself to getting better. For the first time in a long time, I didn't hurt constantly. I didn't have constant headaches. I no longer needed to cycle between Advil and Tums to try and manage my pain levels but also the ulcers I was forming due to the obscene amounts of Ibuprofen I was taking. My Dr.s would eventually become my mentors when I decided to switch my major and start pursuing a career in healthcare. 

Graduate school is no joke. Something I learned is that this story I'm [REDACTED_NAME] here isn't original. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the only person who's life got turned upside down by a car accident. I felt as though a third of my class had similar stories to why they're pursuing a career in healthcare. It was quite the wake-up call when you've always seen yourself as a Bruce Wayne or Harry Potter type character; a protagonist created from tragedy. There were a lot of Batmans in my grad school. 

While I was at grad school, I was in a class called General Diagnosis. This class is a fairly sizable class where you learn all about pathologies and different clinical diagnoses that you could encounter varying from trauma to the most obscure of tapeworms. It was a really cool class and we had this really fun professor. She had attitude, but it was that cool kind of attitude. Calling it sassy would be an insult to her... Regardless, she's a genuinely wonderful professor and amazing human-being. I know this because fate works in amazing ways. It was the weekend before Canadian Thanksgiving (a decent number or students at my school were Canadian, so a lot of them were traveling and absent from class this day). Our Professor, we'll call her Dr. FJ, was telling a story about alcoholism and how she'd been witness to a lot of accidents during her time as a EMT... 
I imagine a lot of readers are starting to figure it out. Dr. FJ was one of the EMTs who rode with my mom and I to the hospital 6 years earlier. 
As she's telling the story, recalling one of the worst accidents she'd ever seen and describing it in vivid details, every hair on my body stood up as I started realizing that she's telling my story. The punchline to her story is that there was a young kid who survived the accident in the back seat of the car that was struck. I was biting my tongue up until this point. I knew I had to tell her and come clean. I was the kid in the back seat of that car. 
""December 26th. I was that kid.""
Here stood before me one of my favorite teachers who coincidentally helped save my family that night. She came up to me on our mid class break (2 hour long courses), and we caught up and discussed my parents. My parents eventually got the opportunity to meet Dr. FJ at my White Coat Ceremony and my Graduation. It was surreal and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it was a little awkward in all reality, but it was truly one of my fondest memories from those years. This interaction just further assured me that I was on the right path and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to be able to help others like I was helped those many years prior. 

Fast-forward to today - I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a practicing Dr. and have my own wellness clinic now. Inside my office I have a painting I did when we first had our accident. It's nothing special but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] biased. I think it's a beautiful amateur painting that really helped me understand not just myself but the man who nearly took everything from me that slushy night. The painting is of an angel with one golden, angelic wing, and one dark and bat/dragon-like wing. Behind the angel is a Taoist yin-yang symbol with the central dots being eyes that look back at the viewer. It serves as a mirror and a reminder that everyone is capable of great good and great evil. Just because someone did something evil (whether subjectively or objectively), doesn't mean that they're unredeemable. 

The man who struck us that night did something irresponsible and wrong. He left behind two kids who're now likely full grown and/or entering adulthood. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a father yet, but I hope to be someday, but I know it'd tear me apart if I couldn't see my kids grow old and get the chance to celebrate life with them. To say he really screwed up with his decision-making that night would be an understatement, however, I pity the man and have a small... ever so slight... appreciation and compassion for him. He, unknowingly, propelled me down this path that's lead me to find purpose and to be extremely happy, healthy, as well as a much more mature and patient person. I have healthier relationships now, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] so many people cope and overcome their obstacles in life. Thank you, sir, for you helped me grow and I hope your spirit can rest well knowing that I will do my best and continue to try and enrich the lives of those I interact with. I will live my life for the both of us. 

Thank you, Redditors, for staying with me this long and I hope y'all got something from this too.",13,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My whole life story","Hello Reddit...
I apologize for my lack of punctuation in advance..
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a slump today and wanted to type out my story to whoever happens to read this. When I was just a chile 2-3 I lived with my father and my mother... He was a horrible man and took advantage of her she was 10 years younger at the time they met. I don't know how their relationship was in the beginning anyway he was scum... Drunk all the time high on whatever he he avoided paying taxs... anyway he started beating my mom she injured her back and ended up with a herniated disc in her back she couldn't work he would treat her like a dog I can't say for sure how long before I was born but I know It went on for a while.

When I was born into this world which today I question If I even wish I was he was bad he would beat on her try to have sex/makeout with her touch her all kinds of things In front of me... He abused me physically and physiologically I can't say exactly for sure what happened but I remember I was In a highchair maybe just 2 years old he pulled his pants down and showed me his ass and said ""Your daddy is a pervert"" around the same age I opened the fridge one time and he threw me on the floor for it...        One thing I will never forget is the day when he made me throw my Mothers keys behind the couch and made her get them to hurt her back... he would kick our cats and such.. I lived in hell for my first few years on this earth.

My Mom tried so hard to get me out of there she did everything she could but he would beat her more threaten her and of course lied about everything he ever had done after my mom spent all her money and worked her ass off she finally escaped and took me across the country to WA where I am [REDACTED_NAME]. 

Now I could be wrong about this but I think we ended up having to move back to him for a few years with all the court stuff he said my mom was crazy and he was god all mighty long story sort of short here he got off the hook nothing happened hes a free man with a new wife and 4 new kids... 

Now I had so many problems growing up It probably was when I started school I had anger problems I was crude had a horrible time keeping friends back talked to teacher had no respect for them if they weren't ""nice"" to me I was in trouble constantly I got suspended for 2 weeks In 5th grade.

I was seeing a therapist throughout that whole time now during that time my father demanded visits with me they were supervised at least but every week when he would visit I would have night terrors grind my teeth and get no sleep It was a nightmare In It's self.

They stopped when I was about 8 or 9... that sort of sums up my childhood.

Things got better It was in the past obviously it was still a problem middle was just as bad as elementary but in comparison It was better I guess... not really.. in 2010 I was diagnosed with PTSD from what my dad had done and the schools wouldn't listen I was still in the office every god damn day.

This Is when things got bad again I made my fair share of mistakes in middle school I was oblivious to the repercussions of my actions on the final day of 8th grade I had pissed off a kid with anger problems a week prior I told the principle he actually ignored me blatantly and said ""No nothing will happen"" (the kid said he would kick my ass) so back to the last day everyone was in the gym the kid was string me down with his friend I knew he was mad.... He started following me I was looking for help but no one was listening It was loud I saw the back exit and started to run before I could get out.... It was too late.

He picked me up and used me to push open the door lifted me and threw me on the sidewalk (He weighed about 250 pounds I was a skinny 110 then) I couldent breath I was stunned and my back and head and neck were all hurt... I tried to get up but stumbled down the janitor told him to go away fucking dumb ass thought we were ""fighting"" anyway his fuckhead mom was in the parking lot and took him away I called 911 and so did some other people I got hauled off on a backboard in front of half the school.

Now that wasn't the worst I was pretty shaken after that but I recover somewhat.

After that In the summer I got caught up in the wrong crowd of people started smoking weed they were always fighting I was always downtown or other where they lived in the projects... they were the definition of welfare I met them through a girl friend of mine she was in a relationship with one of them and so I was with them almost daily.

One day I told the girls boyfriend she had cheated on him which he had and that was a mistake I think about so much.
I was also dating her friend and she dumped me we got into a fight she made fun of the abuse my dad did to me.. Now was this right of her? No.. But I responded with ""I hope your step dad rapes you so and you get made fun of so you know how it feels"" clearly not smart... now by that time the girl who had introduced me to them hated me for what I told her BF my ex gf hated me but I still thought her boyfriend was my best friend.

One day I get a call from him ""Hey come hangout at the park next to my house"" nothing out of the ordinary I did my mom was out of town I took the city bus downtown then up to his side of town. He was with someone I did not know but I didn't think much of it I walked up to them and he says ""What's up?"" I said I had to pee.... He say ""sorry I have to do this"" the next thing I know he has me in a choke hold and in falling to the ground I try and brace myself and that's when my right collar bone snapped I was unaware for a bit he held me down.. while he friend kicked me in the back at least 10 times... I screamed.. no one in the whole fucking park even noticed I was being attacked he finally let go and I jumped up and tried to explain myself desperately.
He though I had just said that to her out of the blue not knowing the context of the situation at all. They continued to follow me as I backed away after I explained he stopped and told his friend to as well... I was shocked my pulse must have been 150 as the adrenalin went away I felt a horrible pain in my shoulder and my back hurt I didn't know what the hell just had occurred all I knew was something was broken. I walked back to the bus stop in agony waited there took the bus downtown waited for that bus got home about an hour after being jumped realized I was injured bad I called 911 and then help came.

Broken collar bone spent the day in the hospital got lot's of vicodin...
Then went home I think later that day..

The next week was indescribable I was In so much pain I could hardly move I didn't eat I was afraid of someone breaking into my house I was afraid of the world that day of being attacked changed me forever the trauma of that incident will be in my bones and my body forever PTSD was no longer a diagnoses It was a full on reality nothing was safe every sound shook me every person my age scared me I hardly left my home my arm was immobile... 

I never knew life could be such a nightmare...
one week later school starts first day of high school I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a sling I people who had beef with me from middle school were shoving me pushing me all kinds of things and the girl who introduced me all of this was one of those people. She screamed all kinds of names at me cheap insults every time she saw me I never would ever wish that week of my life on anyone.
I tried to get help from the school they did absolutely nothing    NOTHING AT ALL I was injured scared and being beat up and they did not care one tiny bit.

One day at lunch this kids brother who told him too had 6 juniors walk up to me at lunch and they all told me how they were going to ""kick my ass again"" That was about 5 days into that school year I got up walked away and saw a group of random people walking towards me I dident even know them but I got so freaked out knew the school wouldent help and I was on my own. I left I walked about 5 miles downtown and called my mom and explained what happened and ended up home.

Now on top of everything a week later after I decided I couldn't keep going to school I woke up noticing a sharp pain in my side yup appendicitis, appendectomy, more vicodin 5 days in the hospital....

I spent 4 months at home smoking weed (had a green card) not able to leave due to pain and fear life was never the same everyone was a threat this actually went on for 9 months I never went back to freshmen year I was on all kinds of meds I was seeing a therapist again nothing was helping anyway after a year of nothing but sitting in my room I finally got out a little. I had tried to go to school in the end but I couldn't even walk in the building without being afraid. 

By the next summer I joined this program called GRUB It was this farm it was part of the school and you got credits and money anyway that helped a little and I was feeling ready to go back to school because of that program but about 4 days before school was to start I got told I was not going to be accepted into the school year... they let every other person in but me.


So to the present day I go to 3 periods of school failing all my classes on lots of pills cut myself a while back got hooked on Vicodin for a few months got addicted went through withdrawal and live every day in fear PTSD is horrible It makes the world seem like a war to me i can hardly be at school I worry someones going to jump me or kill me or stab me or the worst will happen people still fuck with me.. 
Oh and as soon as my collar bone was healed I trained in Krav Maga and Jeet Kun Do self defense for about a year did p90x twice worked my ass off and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] so afraid I really want to leave this world sometimes the school continues to fuck me as well as the students.

I'll never be the same but I guess it happened for a reason it made me who I am I have lot's of undetermined health problems going on at the moment as well.. I hope one day I will be free again and I dream of the past when life was a gift If anyone reads this thanks.

t3782c,1646023791,2/28/2022 4:49,TrueOffMyChest,My boyfriend makes me hate my 2 months postpartum body and he doesn't even realize it,"Me walking over to fridge, sees my BF looking at me with weird expression:""What?""

BF:""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sitting here thinking 'damn, I picked *that.*""

Me:""What do you mean?""

BF:*imitating my walking* ""Like this, stomach out, boobs down to here...ass sticking out like you're a baby with a full diaper.""

Me: ...

BF:""At least the underwear holds your ass up.""

I'm 2 months postpartum, and while I've lost all the baby weight, I know that 1. My boobs got ridiculously huge during pregnancy. 2. Breastfeeding has made them not perky anymore. I also know that my degenerating spinal condition probably makes my walk a little funky looking. 

But all I could do was sit there in disbelief, tell him it was mean, and go back to eating my salad. I was confused because he'd been coming onto me not thirty seconds prior when he saw the underwear on me. I thought he was joking, or saying that he couldn't believe he ""picked *that*"" because of my attitude or messy hair or some other dumb shit.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to the store in the morning to buy some extra hoodies and pajama pants. I need to do laundry so I thought I was safe walking around in just underwear and a tank top, but I guess I was wrong. It's like me losing all of the baby weight plus a few pounds in 2 months time wasn't good enough for him. 

I wish I could get a reduction or a lift. He doesn't realize though that if I have another kid, it'll undo the effects of a reduction or a lift. Yet he tells me how I could use a breast lift.

idk. I feel shitty about my body. I want to be intimate with him. I remember how much lust we had in the start of the relationship, how obsessed he was with my body and only bringing up the positives. I never put effort into taking good nudes until I met him, because he ate them up and worshipped my curves.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to pretend that I have the perfect body, and yes couples should be honest with each other, but I feel like there's a line that a man shouldn't cross when talking to his girlfriend about her body's flaws. Especially when she's two months postpartum. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this all out. I feel like horse shit. I probably look like horse shit too. Literally the only things wrong with me are my breasts and my posture. There's not anything I can do for my posture with how bad my spine is, but hopefully one day I can get a lift or a reduction. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] 153 pounds (I weighed about 153-156 before I got pregnant) so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to do my best not to go above 160. I don't want him to be able to use my weight against me too.",15826,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mzd09t,1619485771,4/27/2021 1:09,stories,There Are Voice Narrators Who Are Forcing Writers to Write Horror Stories On Reddit In Order To Profit On YouTube,"

My weekly scary stories that I post on subreddits to include 
r/scarystories and 
r/wholesomenosleep had caught the attention of a moderator on the Discord app group ""OnlyTheBestWriters,"" where a collaboration of other writers were also invited to work together and discuss current reader trends.

There were 10 other horror writers who were selected for the exclusive Discord group where each writer had a minimum of one hundred thousand Reddit post karma points from the various stories that they have have posted and had over 500 Reddit followers.

The moderator who went by the username, [REDACTED_USER]$ was a really nice woman who went out of her way to make sure everyone was properly introduced to the group and felt welcomed.  Being that we are all writers, it didn’t take long for us to start typing away and finding additional information about each other. All of the writers in the group are from the United States and our occupations vary from being professional writers to construction workers, where there are a mix of five woman and five men.

[REDACTED_USER]$ was proactive in the group where she created “ice breaker activities,” where we even learned more about each other like our occupations, ages, and where each other lived.  Though we were all talented writers, we all felt like individual islands prior to joining the Discord and now there was a sense of a community within the group.

As the weeks went on,
[REDACTED_USER]$ started her own narration business where each of our stories would be narrated on YouTube.  In the past, this was quite a common thing to occur to have our stories narrated but [REDACTED_USER]$ promised us $1 per 100 views which was by far the best offer any of us writers in the Discord group had ever received especially considering some YouTube videos could receive 100k views or more.

[REDACTED_USER]$ had us link her subreddit page that contained all of her YouTube links at the bottom of our stories, so our readers could access her YouTube account.  

All of the Discord members in the writers group would check their respective YouTube narrations and we would all comment on how the number of views would rise each day.  One of my stories was at fifty thousand and was continually growing.  Another writer had close to a half million views and we were celebrating every day knowing we were eventually going to get more and more money.

[REDACTED_USER]$ had us all open a PayPal account and we would all check it daily to see when we would receive our first payments from her.

Weeks went by and we continued to send [REDACTED_USER]$ our stories, where she would narrate them and we were all talented writers in the Discord group so most of our stories would get well over the one thousand upvotes on the various subreddits, that we posted them on.  However, one writer in our Discord group [REDACTED_USER] posted a message on the Discord saying that he had received a private message from [REDACTED_USER]$ that the stipulation of our contract for the narrations was that each one  of our stories we posted had to get a mandatory one thousand upvotes and that he was in violation for not meeting the contractual amount of upvotes.  [REDACTED_USER] then said “I’m being threatened that I have to personally reach out to my followers to beg for upvotes and also has anyone actually been paid yet?”

The comment from
[REDACTED_USER] set off a tidal wave of other comments from writers in the Discord group where everyone was getting pissed off because no one else had actually received any money either.  Also the so called contract was embedded in small print in the rules section of the Discord group that no one had bothered to read.

[REDACTED_USER] commented on our Discord group that he wasn’t reaching out to any of his followers until he was paid as promised for the six previous stories that were narrated by [REDACTED_USER]$, which everyone agreed was an appropriate measure.

Two days later  
[REDACTED_USER] posted on our Discord group that he got suspended from his elementary school teaching job because of “bogus” photos of him with an unknown underage boy.  He swore that the photos were photoshopped and he has no idea of the identity of the photographed Korean looking boy.  To make matters worse the mother of the boy came forward to the superintendent of the school district and corroborated the story so he’ll likely face criminal charges and be fired from his job.

There was collective silence in the group because not only did we feel an eerily coincidence to [REDACTED_USER]$’s threat towards [REDACTED_USER] and his current demise but if you listen really carefully to [REDACTED_USER]$’s narrations you can pick up on a very slight Asian accent.  An accent where English was her first language, but she probably also spoke an Asian language frequently at home, based on approximately one in 20 of her words she spoke that would have an Asian tone to it.  It kind of reminded me of watching the movie, The Goodfellas, where you could tell the character’s. first language was English, but they talked with Italian slang mixed in.

With all the stuff going on with [REDACTED_USER], [REDACTED_USER]$ sent him another private message saying that his most recent story was still below the one thousand upvote mark and that he needed to fix it immediately or there would be consequences.

U/sixheadedtoad posted that message on our Discord group in a panicked state saying “I can’t even go to the grocery store without someone calling me a ‘pervert’ for something I had no involvement in and now I’m be threatened with ‘consequences’ if I don’t get more upvotes on my story.  What do I do?”

Everyone in our Discord group was in a panic as well and we all felt unsafe posting anything negative in our Discord group for fear of reprisals from [REDACTED_USER]$.

I could really start to see the panic in [REDACTED_USER] where he started posting messages nearly every hour on our Discord group such as “I reached out to all of my followers to upvote my story but I’m still short. What do I do?”  The sad part was that nobody responded back to him for fear from [REDACTED_USER]$.  So the next hour he said he randomly gifted other Reddit users coins with a message begging them to upvote his story.  By the end of the day and spending close to five hundred dollars of his own money, he finally got the one thousand upvotes.  

I could only assume that [REDACTED_USER]$’s motivation for the one thousand upvotes was for her listeners to see that she only gets the best quality stories and also to force us writers to write good quality stories, but also she is a deranged psychopath who has control issues.

[REDACTED_USER] messages changed gears to him being suspended at work to him pressuring the police to further question the unknown Korean women and her son, who he apparently had an inappropriate relationship with based on the “bogus” photos.

Today is Friday and [REDACTED_USER]$ posted on the Discord group that our “Stories must be posted by Monday morning!”

The joy we all once received from entertaining our readers on Reddit has now turned into absolute fear.  For we know that we have to get at least 1000 upvotes or else [REDACTED_USER]$ will do something to terrorize us.

The scariest part that we all learned from [REDACTED_USER]’s situation was that [REDACTED_USER]$ knows everything she needs to know about us, which includes our names, where we lived, where we worked and our families, so we couldn’t even just leave Reddit and stop writing.

Monday came and we all posted our stories on our chosen subreddits.  Then each one of us vented on the Discord group saying things like “my story is crap because I felt so pressured” or “I’ll be lucky if I get 10 upvotes.”

It seemed like last week we were all waiting to see how much money our narrations would bring us but now not only did none of us expect any money, but we were much more worried about if our individual stories would get the minimal one thousand upvotes, so we wouldn’t be terrorized.

So now everyone’s posts on the Discord group were for given updates on the status of their upvotes.  For some, the upvotes were trending to a point where they would exceed the required upvotes but for about two others they knew they were far short and were going to have to rely on some desperation tactics to gain more upvotes.

Fortunately for me, I knew that I would be fine for this week because I had a good quality story already written about a month ago that I was holding on to, but I was more concerned about the following week.

[REDACTED_USER] had posted on  the Discord group that the photos were taken to the police crime lab where indeed they were determined to be photoshopped.  Also, [REDACTED_USER] said that the original Korean women who had  stepped forward had also vanished.  He went on to say that the damage has been already done and he will always be labeled as a pervert in his school district even when he gets reinstated in his job.

Today is now Friday and 
[REDACTED_USER], who had only gotten 500 upvotes, posted that when he returned from work yesterday his house was burnt down by a suspected arsonist.  

To try keep herself safe,
[REDACTED_USER] has been sending random Redditor’s lewd pictures of herself to try to garnish more upvotes because [REDACTED_USER]$ had been threatening her but hasn’t done anything drastic yet.

By Friday night [REDACTED_USER]
might have sold her soul by sending the lewd photos but she managed to get the 1000 upvotes.  She was really emotional in her Discord posting’s commenting how she’s married with kids and just sending photos wasn’t good enough for some of the Redditor’s to get an upvote, so she had to do some really regrettable things just to protect her family and her job.

We also received another message from [REDACTED_USER]$ saying that our stories were due on Monday.  The whole week, I was working on a story about being the only passenger on a plane and landing in an abandoned airport.  It wasn’t my best and it wasn’t my worst story that I have written, but it had hope .

Everyone else on the Discord group were posting that they couldn’t come up with any good stories because they were too stressed out to think clearly.  Six of the Redditor’s on our Discord group had deleted their Reddit accounts and their Facebook accounts.  After I posted my story on Monday, I tried calling each of the six Redditor’s respective employers, where I was told for each six of them that they had abruptly quit, so I have no idea of their whereabouts or what happened to them.

The sad part is that [REDACTED_USER]$ found six new replacements for them on the Discord group, where [REDACTED_USER]$ repeated the same cycle of initially being nice and welcoming in order to gain their personal information from the new group members.

I have a wife and a young daughter so I was really feeling the pressure. I have a federal job with good pay where I couldn’t just run and hide somewhere, where I work as a psychologist in a federal correctional institution. A lot of my stories are derived from hallucinations that the psychiatric inmates have told me or actual real life events that the inmates have told me as well, so I have no shortage of horror stories that I have a tendency to add my own twist.

My mindset was that, I just had to do what [REDACTED_USER]$ expected of me so my daughter, Grace could continue her happy suburban life.

However, I also had a plan up my sleeve, where I was going to wait for [REDACTED_USER]$ to get sloppy and leave a clue to her actual identity whether if it was through her Discord harassment posts, or through her narrations, or through one of her henchmen or henchwomen that she contracts to carry out her evil deeds, but I was determined to find her real identity.

I know [REDACTED_USER] told the police about [REDACTED_USER]$ but once he was cleared of his charges he didn’t want to pursue [REDACTED_USER]$ or the unknown Korean woman for fear of further retaliation from [REDACTED_USER]$ and the police had such a back log of other criminals to pursue that they were more than happy to drop the case.

So on top of my job, I continued to post my weekly stories where some weeks I barely came close to the 1000 upvotes.

I even sent a private message to one of the new Discord writer’s, warning her not to reveal any personal information on the Discord group and in fact leave Reddit altogether before it was to late, but she foolishly forwarded the message to [REDACTED_USER]$ and luckily the only thing that happened to me was that my 2006 Camry was fire bombed in the parking lot of my job.  I figured an old car was much easier to replace than my house or the loss of my wife and daughter.  So now I post nothing in the Discord group and watch as these poor new writers dig their own graves.

Once [REDACTED_USER]$ gets all the personal information she needs on the writers, then she’ll start getting more and more evil and nonchalantly throw out  [REDACTED_USER] or  [REDACTED_USER] usernames to the new members and brag how she “altered” their lives. She would even post how erroneous accusations against her to YouTube are pointless without actual police charges or an arrest.  She really was a true sociopath who lived off of power and fear from others.

As much as I tried to just post my stories on Reddit and pretend that I had never met [REDACTED_USER]$, I found my self constantly looking at the Discord app to she if she would mistakenly post a comment that was too revealing about herself that she was too slow to erase or I’d listen for countless hours to her narrations for any type of background noise that she inadvertently let slip into her recordings.

As the weeks went on my wife made me go see a therapist because I “looked horrible” and because I was more and more detached from her and Grace, where I never told either of them that I was being forced to write stories under the threat of physical harm.

So I went to the therapist and blamed my lack of sleep and emotional detachment on a mid life crisis versus some psycho path who was trying to use me as slave labor.

Ironically as I was driving home from a therapist appointment, I was painfully listening to [REDACTED_USER]$’s voice in one of her narrations, when I almost slammed my car into a tree when I heard a voice that wasn’t her’s in the background.

I knew she just posted this story so I quickly pulled over knowing that she would erase the story at any moment once she realized the mistake she made.

I pulled over and listened over and over to her narration and I yelled out “I got you, I got you, you dumb witch. I got you,” because after replaying the recording at least ten times, I was certain that I heard the distant automated voice on a passing train say “Temple University.”  I had visited Temple as a potential college when I was in high school and I remembered hearing that voice then taking the train to go see the campus of Drexel.

I figured she must have a house or an apartment on Temple’s campus and for whatever reason, she got sloppy for this narration and inadvertently left a window open or something for the train sound to be heard.

Though this woman was a complete psychopath, I also knew from my years as a psychologist that she wasn’t dumb and more than likely she probably held a faculty position at Temple.

I was really fortunate that I pulled over when I did to listen to the mistake in the background of the narration, because she had erased the story from YouTube no more than five minutes later.

When I got home, I went right on Temple’s website and sifted through all the women that fit the profile of [REDACTED_USER]$, which I narrowed the candidates down to 10 potential women.

Because it was 9:00 p.m. at night, when I attempted to call each of them, I got their voicemails which made my job 10 times easier of trying to hear hear their voices.  I wasn’t a voice expert but some of the woman could be easily excluded based on the pitch of their Voice’s or more so if they had a distinct accent.

Then I was in total disbelief when it came to voicemail number seven on my list, because based on only about 20 quick words she spoke on her voice recording, I was 100% certain it was her, because I had listened to thousands of hours of her voice narrations, where I just wanted to stick a butter knife in both of my ears, but all those painful hours of listening to her recordings had just paid off.

Her name is Mary Kim and she is an associate professor at the university.  Out of all the years, I worked as a psychologist in the prison, she wins the prize for being the biggest sociopath, where she thought she could just terrorize people under an alias of [REDACTED_USER]$ and never having to show her face, so she could hide and live a “normal life.”

One of her students had actually posted a short YouTube video of her lecturing in front of the class, where I was even more convinced after listening to her lecture that she was [REDACTED_USER]$.

The next thing I did was reach out to all the current and past Discord group members and I sent them the YouTube message of Professor Kim lecturing in front of the class.

I learned that not a single one of the Discord members went to the police but instead took matters into their own hands where they had each devised their own ways to torture [REDACTED_USER]$ or who they just call Professor Kim now.

[REDACTED_USER]$ like me just couldn’t leave her job, so when she gets “kidnapped for the weekend” or comes home to her apartment by the train station and finds everything missing, it’s no wonder she’s developed a terrible stuttering problem and probably couldn’t do the YouTube narrations anymore if she tried.",54,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3bofde,1435698609,6/30/2015 21:10,offmychest,"My story of addiction, naivety, and hell. If you are going to use drugs, Know what you're using!!","This is my first reddit post EVER so please go easy on me. Let me start off by saying that I am 23 now, but at the time I was 19, freshly moved out of Mom and Dad's house. I have always had every opportunity I could imagine, lived in a wealthy area, I was what MOST would consider spoiled. I had always been curious about drugs but never had the balls to actually try them. I had absolutely no experience with drugs other than my incredibly naive second hand knowledge about them. I had grown up believing that all drugs were the devil and you should never get close to them, if you made eye contact with someone on drugs you immediately drop dead and your puppy has to be put down. Ok maybe not that intense but it's the same kind of small town-esque perspective on drugs that you are picturing in your head right now. So to me, there was weed, ecstasy, coke, heroin, and meth. Those were drugs stay away from them. 

     This is where the story begins. When I was about 16, I was walking past my mother inside of our home when i noticed she had an orange pill bottle full of hexagon shaped little pinkish orange pills, and watched her take one. My teenage curiosity reared its head, and although I had never taken or even had a thought about taking someone else's Rx, i figured why the hell not. No clue what it was, or what it was for but my mom took them, so obviously it wasn't going to kill me. That was my reasoning. So later that night I went into the cabinet where she kept these pills and I opened the bottle, and swallowed one. This was at about 7PM. A couple hours later it was bedtime for me and I honestly had forgotten all about taking the pill, so i curled up and went to bed like normal. At some point in the middle of the night, I woke up from a dead sleep. I noticed that I had waves of euphoria rushing over me, a glowing ball of happiness emanating from the pit of my stomach, and my nose was itchy. I would scratch it and more waves of euphoria. It was like I had woken up in heaven. I fell back asleep and then I woke up in the morning feeling normal but i remembered the events in the middle of the night, still not registering that it was from the pill I had taken, I chalked it up to the idea that I was just dreaming, half awake or some nonsense that I told my self. 

     Weeks had passed since that incident, and out of the blue the thought of those little orange pills popped into my head again. Thats when all of the pieces came together and i hypothesized that it was the pills that had given me that heavenly euphoria. When I got home from school that day, I immediately went to the cupboard and tossed a pill down my throat. It dawned on me, hmm maybe I should look at the bottle. The drug was called suboxone, and I had never heard of it, all i knew was that my mom had a steady supply and she obviously didn't notice when they went missing. 

    For those of you that don't know, Suboxone is basically a synthetic Opiate that is given to people who are trying to quit heroin or other opiates to relieve the withdrawal symptoms, then they slowly ween off of the suboxone until their body is completely non-dependant on drugs. Or at least that's the idea. Something that is not very well known is that doctors back in 2002?-2005? (don't quote me on that, best guess) were actually prescribing this drug as an anti-depressant, but it was only if EVERY other Rx had failed. It was the last ditch effort Rx. put two and two together and my Mother was a Very depressed person. At the time I didn't know this, and I didn't know what suboxone was, I was just about as in the dark as you could get. 

     about 30 mins after I popped that pill, I felt tingles from the base of my spine up to the top of my head, and immediately felt light and energetic. I had that glowing ball of radiating ecstasy coming from my stomach, and it was as strong as ever. Keep in mind, this drug is given to heroin users to relieve withdrawal, and if it is strong enough to relieve withdrawal, then it was definitely strong enough to send 16 year old drug-virgin me to the straight to the sky. That night, even though I was as relaxed as I had ever felt in my life, I couldn't fall asleep. I laid in my bed just basking in the glow, thinking thoughts that fed into my happiness. I watched the sun rise at about 6:00 am and decided I should get up. For not having slept all night, I had an incredible amount of energy and I was in an unbelievably great mood. As the day came to an end, I still had that feeling, but it had reduced itself to a ""content"" feeling. I slept that night and woke up the next day feeling pretty normal, no craving for the pills, not even a thought about it. Weeks later, I told my my friend Brooks about this miracle pill. He was just as drug-naive as I was and he agreed to try it out. Brooks spent the night, we popped the orange dream pills and were hit with euphoria. Brooks told me that he felt like he had to puke, but he didn't even care because he was so happy. 

     That was the last time I had taken the drug for a while. Until about 3 years later, after i moved out on my own. One day, I randomly got the urge to pop and orange dream pill. No matter, go to my parent's house, check the cupboard. This time, there weren't pills in a bottle, but rather thin paper-like strips, same orange color. The first and only smart decision that I made during this escapade . I went hope, carefully cut off a tiny corner of the strip, put it in my mouth and felt that familiar feeling. This time it was intensified. I stayed up all night playing video games, listening to music, and generally just being happy. 

     Before long, I was stealing a strip every couple of weeks. Then it turned into once a week. Then twice a week. pretty soon I realized that this was probably not a good idea. This thought was provoked by the fact that I was starting to notice in the days when i hadn't taken this, I felt.... Off. Not quite sad, but definitely not normal. I also realized that I had built up an incredible tolerance when I put an entire strip in my mouth, and this time, I didn't get that creeping glow of euphoria. I just felt bleh. I really need to stop doing this, I thought. This is the last time. 

     About a week later, I still hadn't taken any more and I was feeling off. At the time, I didn't quite realize I was feeling different, and I definitely didn't think it was from the drugs, because I had stopped, and they are safe right? they're from the doctor. They can't be that bad. Boy was I wrong. after a night of partying at a friend's house about a week and a half later, I had an exceptionally brutal hangover, which was weird because I didn't drink near as much as I was used to drinking.  I went home and went back to bed. I woke up at about noon, I had a pounding headache and I had that anxious feeling in my stomach, but this wasn't just physical. I was off. not right. I couldn't explain it. That night, I still didn't feel normal. But i brushed it off. That night I fell asleep, and I had a dream that I would never forget. I was going out to dinner with family and co-workers, everyone around me was happy, smiling, enjoying life. But as I sat at the restaurant table, I was not feeling the same. I felt sick. Tired. Sad. But not the normal kind, this was different. It had a hint of evil. it was like in this dream, I was in a parallel universe, where I was void of happiness, but i couldn't convey or get anyone to see what It was that I felt, and everyone around me was so blissful, I felt like I was missing out on some secret that everyone knew but me, I felt left behind. 

     I assume that this dream was the beginning of my body starting to go into withdrawal. I had never felt like that before. It was horrible. I woke up that morning feeling like I was ready to cry. For no reason. I didn't feel rested, I was tired. I had a headache, a backache, no energy or appetite. I felt horrible. maybe I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sick? I thought. In the next couple days realized two things. One-Maybe it was those feel good pills that caused this? Two- I really think it was those feel good pills, because i feel like death. Finally, it made sense. I knew why i was feeling the way I was. It was withdrawal. but not just any withdrawal, Opiate withdrawal. Constant shivers, sweating, sneezing, aches the whole shebang. These withdrawals were not as intense as what i believe Heroin withdrawals would be like, but here's my best attempt at describing the over-all feeling:

     Picture that you are at the one place in the world where you feel most comfortable, most safe. Maybe it's your home, maybe grandmas house, whatever. Now picture you are there in that place, but its not quite right. Things are a little bit dull, a little bit fuzzy. The normal green lush beautiful vegetation looks worn, maybe even brown. Like at the end of fall when plants start to shrivel as the temperatures drop. Now you realize that you don't feel right in your safe place, you don't even feel comfortable. In fact, you need to go to your safe place just to get rid of the feelings you have in this progressively dull, sad version of the place where you used to come to refresh your soul. But the thing is, you can't go to your safe place. you're already there. 

     I felt homesick, even though I hadn't gone anywhere. I had barely slept in days, and the absolute worst part of it all was that I did not tell ONE person about what I was going through, what I had done to get myself there. I was alone in this sense, and that added to the depression. As far as I was concerned, this was my problem, I put myself there, now it was my responsibility to fix it. After researching on the internet, I discovered that Suboxone has a half-life of 24-48 hours. That means that each time i took a dose, it stayed in my system for give or take 4 days. That meant that the withdrawal and recovery process would also be longer than normal. Some reports I've read had said that after 4 months people were still feeling this way. I was terrified. But i thought to myself, I don't have a choice. I have to just deal with it. I didn't have any meds, no weed, no nothing to help cope with the symptoms. for 3 months, my life was:
1. Wake up feeling like I hadn't slept in days, back and neck are in immense amount of pain causing an incurable headache. 
2. No appetite, sneeze, runny nose, sneeze, stuffy nose. I feel like crying right now. 
3. I don't want to get up today, I don't want to talk to anyone, do anything, Im tired but I can't sleep
4. I am [REDACTED_NAME] people that I am [REDACTED_NAME] this from, I have to pretend to be normal. 
5. I am [REDACTED_NAME] out of my skin. It's an itch you can't scratch. Every minute feels like an hour. I can't wait until this is over. 

My family started to notice that I was tired all of the time. I had also lost weight. It was hard to hide the symptoms. My mother talked me into making a doctor's appointment which i went to, lied my ass off saying i didn't know why I had these symptoms, they took some blood tests and to my surprise ended up telling me that they thought I had a virus, so I was able to excuse my symptoms and behavior with that. Still, no one knew. As time went on, I slowly got better. I could fall asleep on melatonin instead of a mass dose of nyquil. I was trying to get out of the house more, but still depressed. I told myself that if I could just hang in there a little bit longer, I would feel normal again eventually. 
     Finally, after about 4 and a half months of slowly progressing out of withdrawal, I almost felt normal. During that time I did not crave or think about the suboxone other than for the fact that I could take my symptoms away for a couple days, but it wasn't like waking up thinking about a fix and going to bed thinking about a fix. 

     It has now been 4 years since then and I haven't touched the drug since. It scares me to death even thinking about it. I still think that the worst part of the whole thing was choosing to hide it, and not tell anyone what I was going through. I have learned tremendous amounts through this experience, The most important being that I need to use this knowledge and experience to help others. I made a one stupid decision not to educate myself on the dangers and effects of a drug that i became addicted to. I have since learned everything I could about drugs, but I do not currently take any drugs at all, nor did I ever try anything else of that nature. Reading and learning about drug culture fascinates me, even though I have absolutely no desire to actually do these drugs. I do smoke pot daily but it's legal here. I am [REDACTED_NAME] coming up on 2 years of marriage to my beautiful wife, we own a house and run a business.

If you take nothing else away from this, Please just remember this: DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!!!!!

If this could save even 1 person from the Misery and hell that I went through, than it is worth it to me. Sorry about the long story, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I was able to get that off my chest.

apvq29,1549992225,2/12/2019 17:23,offmychest,Sitting in a therapist waiting room and I’m not being checked in so I guess I’ll post my story,"I’ve been wanting to unload my kind of sad life for a while on here because it seems like very few people really understand my situation and I think writing it all out will help me.

My childhood was very tame and kind of boring, relatively healthy family life with occasional arguments. I really only played video games and went to school when I was young since I didn’t really have a lot of friends that lived near me and I rarely got to invite people to come over.

My dad graduated from college when I was 12 years old and he began seeking a job as a teacher. My mom runs a business providing karaoke and dj services to restaurants and bars in my area. This is when things started getting bad at home. Mom would be out until 2, 3, or 4 in the morning and come home drunk often. Dad couldn’t sleep because he would worry about her. My dads anger would build up and he would become very irritable. He didn’t want to upset her so he would take it out on me since I was the oldest of two children and as a boy I’m supposed to “take it”. I remember he would pin me against a wall and slam his fist into the wall beside my head. He also once thought I stole his keys so he grabbed me and slung me around and threw me, only to later find his keys in his belt loop.

I started dating a girl when I was 15 and quickly fell in love with her and dated her for almost 2 years, she cheated and lied a lot. She ended up having sex with 2 or 3 of my best friends and it kind of emotionally destroyed me. I know a two year relationship isn’t exactly a huge deal but it was my first girlfriend and I was fairly torn up. Around the time that she first had sex with one of my best friends my dad left. That was in the early summer of 2017. I broke up with her in October of 2017. She attempted suicide and I had to have a friend drive to her house to stop her, she then dropped out of school.

When my dad left he took a job as a truck driver and only came home once every couple months, meaning I only really saw him around 12 times that first year he drove. Things started to fall apart with my mother and her best friend moved in with us. My mom swears her friend never acts like my parent but she gives her full access to my belongings and my room which I don’t think is appropriate. I had smoked weed a little bit after my parents separated and my mom knows about it and she basically tried controlling me in every way she could. I stopped smoking completely until I turned 18.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] 18 and I smoked a bit on my birthday and was smoking maybe every other day for about a month (it’s not legal where I live but with everything going on I needed something to take my mind off of my problems). She ended up finding out about it and basically tearing apart everything I owned to try to find everything I did (she found a klonopin that a dealer had thrown in my bag that I didn’t want, pills just aren’t my thing).

Moving out I finally realized how controlling she was, I was homeless for a week, and she took every cent I had. She ended up taking about 5 grand out of the bank so I couldn’t access it. She believes I just want to run away and go crazy which is not how it is at all. When my dad left I had to take over a lot of his responsibilities including taking care of my sister every night making it impossible to get a real job. She also held the things she paid for over my head, saying she paid for my insurance and my tuition for school, when in reality my dad paid for half of all of those expensive on top of the child support he paid.

In moms mind, even though dad paid half, she put the stamp on the envelope and therefore paid for it. She says how she is entitled to everything I own and I deserve no privacy because she paid for what I use. I’m now living with my father just because I was becoming so depressed I felt suicidal at home and couldn’t leave because I had to watch my sister.

Sorry this is really long, I just have been dealing with a lot.",1,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m tired of having to be scared of men, not being able to walk alone in the dark without fear of being followed. The fact is, that women are more likely to have violent crimes made against them, and most of these crimes will be from men. And crimes against men? Will also mostly be from men. Of course some do come from women. But I’m tired of men not recognizing how women struggle. I’m tired of having to fight for rights to have an abortion, tired of having to be the one to take birth control (if i want to) and the man never needing to deal with the repercussions (side effects of BC), tired of scary things happening to me from men (such as being followed in the night, sexually harassed, catcalled) then when i go tell a man about it they just laugh, i’m tired of having to pay for menstrual products and bleeding 7 days every 3 weeks and bloating and cramping, I’m tired of feeling like my opinion is not as valued as a man’s. Most of all I’m tired that men don’t see their privilege. I’m tired of my struggles not being acknowledged. I just want them to be acknowledged. Stop telling me we have equal rights. I’m so sick of it. You hear about all these horrific crimes men commit yet they still can’t see that they are the problem.

Edit: if you are a man, thinking of commenting on this, maybe talk to another woman about it first. so many of these comments are so hurtful and just proving what I felt. This is an off my chest post, not a prove me wrong post. Please. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of getting shut down.

1ljjyqb,1750792053,6/24/2025 19:07,stories,I ended up with the girl i used to bully,"Back in grade school, I was this kid who likes to show off and do some random things energetic boys would do. Then this girl called me out telling me that i am a ""special child"" for being too erratic. This is the moment that I started bullying her.

I remember puting a melted chocolate in her seat, making slapstick comics about her and even threw her backpack in the rooftop
She eventually told the teacher, and I, as an immature kid ended up punching her. 

Later on, I found out her dad and my dad were friends. We saw each other at friendly occasion and i couldn't even look her in the eye. I stopped bullying her after that.

When I was 15, our dads planned another occasion.  At one point, while hanging out with the youth, and a girl asked why am i silent, she looked at me and said, ""when _x_ was my classmate, He used to make comics about me and punched me in third grade. I was very shocked as it was my first time”
Everybody laughed.
I just smiled while being embarassed

When i was 17, I saw her walking along the road and offered her a ride. She got in. We had small talks.
Another time, I got invited to dinner at their place. Midway through the meal, her mom looked at me and asked,
“Why don’t you date my daughter?” Everybody laughed and while she said ""MOM!!!"", I couldn't contain my smile that i hid my face our of embarrassment. 

After finishing my college degree at 26 year old, I came back in our place and told her that i wanted to court her.

She said yes.

We’re married now. She still brings up the comics and how i punch her at 3rd grade.",2035,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No one should have to read it, because no one should go through it. I am [REDACTED_NAME] it down and posting it to make it more real for me, so I do not forget what happened and where I came from. I am [REDACTED_NAME] okay now, but it has been the struggle of a lifetime and a largely silent one.

 1.From as far as I could remember, as young as I could rememeber, my mother would have episodes where she forgot or refused to take her medication and go through a manic episode combined with heavy drinking. Reader, if you have never seen one they are terrifying and horrifying, crazed and wild. I felt like I had two mothers, and that one (my words to my mother at the time, and often) hated me.

&#x200B;

2. From as young as I could remember, my mother struggled to take her anti-psychotics. She resented it, very loudly, and if she took it too late it mixed with the alcohol and changed or dimished the medicine. She also would use her illness to get away with selfish or cruel statements about us or loved ones. She had delusions of persecution that emerged when she had these mini episodes, where her generosity and anything she did for us or her friends and family were actually terrible exploitation of her mental illness.

&#x200B;

3. At 5 years old I broke down crying in class and I didn't know why. My teacher asked me if it was something at home and I realized it was because my parents were fighting all the time and i felt helpless and afraid.

&#x200B;

4. At 6 years old I had a fever and refused to take medicine for it. My parents held me down and gave me a suppository. It was a traumatic memory. After that, they would threaten the butt medicine if I balked at taking medicine.

&#x200B;

5.At 6 years old, I remember my mother being so drunk she passed out, and I could not wake her up. I was afraid she was dead, and tried to revive her by pressing ice cubes (gotten with a chair against the refrigerator). She did not stir.

&#x200B;

6.At 7 years old, my room was a mess and my mother was tired of cleaning it. She ordered me to clean it, and not knowing where to start i took all my books off my shelf to organize them. She checked on me and became angry at the increased mess. I went to the library and read a book on parenting that said children are easily overwhelmed and need tasks  one part at a time. She dismissed it.

7.At 8 years old my mother needed to take my sister and I to the doctor. She became so drunk she could not find the doctors office, we were afraid for our lives at her driving, and she knocked over our trash can parking. My father explained to us that if she was drunk we could not let her drive us anywhere.

&#x200B;

8.At 9 years old my mother came to pick me up from my Aunt's after work, and she was so drunk I stopped my sister from getting into the car and we walked the half-mile home.

&#x200B;

9.At 9 years old, the house was a mess and my mother had an episode. She came into my room at 8am Saturday morning, ripped the blankets from me still asleep, and screamed that the house was filthy and that she was not cleaning it alone. When we asked what to do with the various things on the table (not knowing where they went), she screamed ""You don't know how to clean a table? I'll show you how to clean a table!"" And used her arm to sweep everything off the table onto the floor. She then told us to sweep up and throw away the 'trash' on the floor.

&#x200B;

10. At 9 years old my sister and I started walking the half-mile to school. We dressed before my parents left for work at 7am, and returned home long before they got home around 6pm. They also stopped helping us with our homework, suggesting we use our teachers or classmates. My grades started slipping and I stopped doing many homework assignments. My parents scolded me for being lazy.

&#x200B;

11. At 10 years old my mother cheated on my father with someone she met at AA (mandated by the courts for dui) who told her that her drinking was not a problem. My sister and I knew because we heard my parents fighting about it.

&#x200B;

12. At 10 years old my parents split up and my dad moved out. Sleeping at my mom's boyfriend Frank's house was uncomfortable (strange place, no beds). When my sister would not sleep, Frank threatend to dicipline her if she did not leave him and my mltger alone. When my father found out, in front of us he told my mom if her boyfriend touched us he would kill him.

&#x200B;

13. At 10 years old I developed night terrors and subsequent insomnia. My father told me to think about happy things. About this time I started eating at night, bored and lonely and desperate to feel better. School became miserable, I stopped socializing, and was largely friendless until 13. I gained weight rapidly from this point on, going from husky to obese, which further isolated me.

&#x200B;

14. At 11 years old a classmate and friend told me he often saw my dad at the grocery store and he always had several cases (24 packs) of beer in his car. He asked me if my father had a drinking problem, and I said nothing, not knowing how to say it was my mother.

&#x200B;

15. At 11 years old I remember telling my mother that it seemed like all she cared about was beer and ciggarettes. She told me it seemed all I cared about was eating and drinking. I was fat because I was selfish.

&#x200B;

16. At 10-11 years old I was between bedrooms (renovations) and my mother would listen to music on headphone, drink, and sob uncontrollably. While I tried to sleep.

&#x200B;

17. At 12 years old, my mother asked if I was happy. I told her that everyday I walked to school I considered throwing myself into traffic.

&#x200B;

18. At 12 I was enrolled in counseling for depression. The counciler spoke to me at length, and then to my mother. When the counciler mentioned that there was a concering amount of drug and alcohol abuse in my stories, my mother said it was not an issue and cancelled all future counciling, explaining to me that I was putting myself and my family in jeopardy by telling anyone that.

&#x200B;

19. At 12 years old I fell and fractured my ankle at my sister's birthday party. Because the pain was not extreme, my parents assured me it was just sprained. They did not bring me to the hospital for two weeks, and in that time I regularly limped half a mile to the babysitters house. Each day. The x-ray confirmed a fracture, and I was told if it got any worse it could stunt the growth of that leg. I was in a cast for months.

&#x200B;

20. At 13 years old my father told me that I needed to get my weight under control, because at my weight I would die before him, and it was a parent's worst fear to bury their child. His solution was that I play outside more. I had no control over what food was purchased or cooked and reader, I ate mayonnaise sandwich lunches and cheese and cracker dinners.

&#x200B;

21. At 13 years old I brought home a test where I had gotten a perfect score and an award. My mother asked if I could get perfect scores on tests why couldn't I do my homework more often? I earned dozens of more awards, and threw them in the trash. Every. Single. Time.

&#x200B;

22. At 13 years old my Father promised during the school year that we would spend more time together that Summer playing a game we had played when I was young but not for years (D&D). That Summer he lost his materials and explained that we just could not play. I realized it was not could not, he just had no time for me. He still followed sports and prime-time tv religiously.

&#x200B;

23.  At 13 years old I was called to the office because my clothes stunk, and asked if there was hot water at home. The laundry had been left in the washer too long.

&#x200B;

24. At 13 years old another student asked me why I wore the same shirt three days in a row. I did not know what to say, it was how my parents wore clothes.

&#x200B;

25. The Summer between 12-13 years old the fighting became so bad, and her episodes so hateful and angry, that I started sleeping during the day and being awake at night. This would go on year round for four years, coming home from school, going to sleep immediately, waking up at 10pm, and being awake for the rest of the day. It was like sleepwalking through life, and crushingly lonely. My parents had no comment.

Wow, this is getting longer than I expected. I will post a part II instead.

Reader, I love my parents. They had their own issues and challenges. But please take it seriously if you or someone you know has children and struggles with alcohol, mental illness, or abuse.",13,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Prologue**

“I never knew when was the last time he looked at me like he did at the beginning. Only one day did he stop doing it…”

I want to reiterate this is my truth about all the events that happened so far in my life...

This kind of experience, I need to share with someone, to externalize everything that happened to me so far, it's been difficult so far. All I can think of is that every heartbreak is proof that I can love again... I’m thankfull for all the pain.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to start by the present moment, listening music using this app as a diary, trying journaling -- not very successful at it. So this is it…

It is past midnight, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] on the floor of my kitchen, my back resting against the fridge, legs stretched in silence. In my hand, a half-full lass of wine. Next to me, a crumpled napkin with almond crumbs and a folded note I never managed to throw away in my journal. It’s the one he left me with the first Valentine we spent together. I told myself I kept it out of absentmindedness, but the truth is more dangerous than that: I kept it because it gave shape to something I once believed in. I don’t even know what I’m hoping for now...

I’ve been trying to write tis story for a while. Not because I want revenge, not because I want pity. But because if I don’t take this pain out of my chest, I’m afraid it will become a permanent scar that doesn’t heal. I am [REDACTED_NAME] writing this for him. I’m writing this for the version of me that keeps showing up at 5 a.m. with a hole in his stomach, gasping for air, wondering…. Why do someone who promised care chose brutal and complete silence instead.

This story is not just about “him”.  It’s  all the ghost that came before him. The ones I kissed. The ones I forgave. The one I waited for at stations they never arrived to. This is my way of making sure that I do not become the sum of who left me. Feeding my open wounded traumas that I once thought they healed.

Some people confuse heartbreak and vulnerability with weakness. I no longer do… Every heartbreak is a proof that I can still love. Deeply. Completely. Even if I have to learn again how to love myself after it. It is a proof that I am [REDACTED_NAME] in this world.

So here it goes. My story. In fragments of what I recall. In wounds that still burns. In the little acts of courage that came from holding someone’s hand without fear of people’s gaze, and in the even greater ones of letting it go.

And if one day someone finds this story and sees their own reflection in it then maybe all this mattered. Learn from me, learn from my feelings and my pain...

**Chapter I: Before Loving**

# 1. A Sensitive Childhood

I remember the softness of the white sheets and the smell of soap on Mom’s T-shirt when she hugged me before bed. My childhood was happy, sheltered by the warmth of a small family in which Mom was the center of everything. Mom—so young and strong—was both refuge and heroine; in her arms I felt protected from the world. I was a profoundly sensitive child: I cried at sad movies, was moved by lullabies, and needed physical affection the way plants need the sun.

From a very young age I developed a vivid imagination. I spent hours watching the clouds, inventing stories about the shapes only I could see in the sky or in the stains on the ceiling. I played in my room, silently, while Mom watched me with a smile.

There were few luxuries at home, but hugs and sweet words were abundant. Whenever sadness or incomprehension knocked at the door of my small chest, I sought comfort in a soft plush bear that always slept with me. I would stroke its fabric ears and press it against my racing heart, finding secret solace in that toy embrace. Mom often found me asleep with the teddy bear trapped between my arms and would tuck me in tenderly without waking me. To me, that stuffed animal and my mother’s hugs were synonymous with home and safety.

# 2. Loss and the Move

The year 2004 marked a rupture that split my life in two. On an autumn dawn my sister’s short life suddenly went out forever. Her sudden death struck us like lightning from a clear sky, leaving us stunned and torn apart. I remember Mom crying silently that night, believing I was asleep, but her sobs reached me through the wall. I was only a child and couldn’t fully grasp what death meant; I only felt an icy void in my stomach and a new fear—the fear of realizing that the people we love can disappear from one day to the next.

After the funeral, Mom decided that moving would be the best option, and my father—who had found another opportunity—accepted it without protest. Our home, once full of laughter and happy memories, had become a painful museum in which every corner whispered my absent sister’s name. We packed our lives into cardboard boxes amid silent tears. I remember putting my teddy bear into one of those boxes, afraid that in the new house it would no longer smell like our old life. We moved to another city in search of a new beginning, though I felt we left a piece of our soul behind those walls.

The move didn’t just mean a change of scenery—arriving in the Chilean desert—it also marked the beginning of a profound loneliness. In the new city I felt lost, friendless, with a mother carrying her own pain while trying to be strong for me, and I trying to be strong for her. Dad got a job and spent long hours away supporting us, so many afternoons I came back to a silent, empty house, while Mom, when she was home, devoted herself entirely to me.

One night, shortly after settling into the new house, I broke down in tears, clutching my pillow. Memories of my sister invaded the darkness of my unfamiliar room and the anguish overwhelmed me. Mom heard my sobs and rushed in. She sat on my bed and wrapped me in her protective arms.

*“I know, my love, I know…”* Mom whispered, cradling me against her chest.  
I buried my face in her T-shirt and let her tears mix with mine.  
*“Why did she leave?”* I cried, my voice breaking. *“I miss her so much…”*  
*“I don’t know, sweetheart,”* she replied, her voice trembling slightly. *“Sometimes things happen that we don’t understand. But I’m here with you. You’re not alone—never forget that.”*

Her words, spoken with such love, were an anchor amid my pain. That night I fell asleep in her arms, listening to her heartbeat, and I silently promised myself to be strong for both of us—for Mom and for my sister’s memory.

# 3. Refuge in Imagination

Over time I learned to hide my sadness and my sense of strangeness behind a shy smile and a rich inner world. The words of my primary-school teacher echoed in my head as I matured so quickly after the loss: *“The pain you feel will never disappear, but each day it will be easier to carry.”*

I had always been prone to daydreaming, but after the loss it intensified. At school I was the quiet kid who drew in the margins of his notebooks and got lost staring out the window. While the other boys played soccer at recess, I preferred to sit under a tree reading or simply imagining stories.

My classmates’ inability to understand my sensitivity made me feel isolated. Some called me “weird” behind my back because I sometimes got too emotional in class or because I preferred talking about books instead of sports. Little by little, my refuge became my own mind. If I felt lonely at lunchtime, I pretended to talk with imaginary friends who always listened. On silent afternoons at home I invented conversations and fantastic adventures so I wouldn’t feel so alone. Mom would come to collect me, and I waited for her, telling stories to the air until I heard the key in the door and then recounted my day in detail.

Every night when I went to bed I still needed a hug to fall asleep. As I grew, my stuffed animals were relegated to the closet, replaced by a pillow that I hugged tightly to my chest. I missed human warmth, and by squeezing the pillow I could fool loneliness for a moment; I imagined it was someone holding me back in the darkness. That intimate habit became my best-kept secret—a small routine that let me feel safe, just as when Mom used to slip in quietly to tuck me in during childhood.

# 4. Secrets of the Heart

When puberty arrived, it brought more questions than answers. At the new school I made one or two friends—quiet boys with whom I shared comics and study sessions. Yet I began to realize I was different from them in a way I didn’t know how to name. I discovered it almost unintentionally, through a silent, deep attraction to a classmate. His name was Adrien; he had an easy laugh and honey-colored eyes that sparkled when he talked about what he loved. At first I thought what I felt for Adrien was admiration: I wanted to spend all my time beside him, I worried if he missed class, and I memorized each of his gestures without meaning to.

One afternoon, while we were doing homework in his room, I noticed myself tracing the line of his jaw when he looked away, or the way a lock of his brown hair fell across his forehead. My heart beat so fast I feared he could hear it in the silence around us.

That afternoon, back home, I replayed every moment of the day with a mix of excitement and shame. Why did my friend seem so handsome? Why did I want to hug him when he was sad, or simply stay over so I could wake up beside him? No other boy spoke of such things; they joked about girls while I nodded silently, feeling I carried an immense secret. With terror I began to understand that what I felt was not admiration but attraction—a yearning that not only cherished his good soul or the way he made me laugh, but also urged me to brush his hand, to be close in a way that frightened me.

Guilt accompanied me for months as I struggled to understand my feelings. Whenever I heard at church that true love could exist only between a man and a woman, my stomach knotted and I wondered if what I felt was wrong.

I was barely thirteen and already bore a secret that felt too heavy: I liked boys. Or rather, I liked one boy—Adrien—and I didn’t know whether that meant my whole being was different from everyone else’s. I said nothing. I didn’t tell Mom, afraid of disappointing her or losing her love. I confessed to no one. I learned to smile and pretend everything was normal while inside I wrestled with the piercing joy of feeling something beautiful and the terror of feeling something forbidden.

To cope, I returned to writing and fantasy. I filled secret diaries with letters I never dared to deliver, addressed to that friend to whom I never confessed the truth. In my stories, sometimes two princes fell in love in a distant kingdom, and I could give them the happy ending I didn’t believe possible for myself in reality. Those tales hidden under the mattress were my way of easing the pressure of an adolescent heart flooded with silences.

# 6. A Glance at the Airport

I was fourteen when I first experienced a clear and unmistakable desire—the kind that suddenly ignites the body. It happened in a Brazilian airport during a long layover on a trip with Mom and Dad. We were in the waiting lounge, surrounded by strangers and the distant murmur of loudspeakers. Bored, I let my gaze wander when my eyes met those of another boy, about my age, waiting across the room. He had dark hair, sun-bronzed skin, and an intent expression, as if he too were studying the travelers’ faces.

It was only an instant—a fraction of a second that felt outside of time: a sustained look that said everything without a single word. Heat surged up my neck to my cheeks. My chest leapt, and something inside me woke with force. In those unknown eyes I discovered desire. It wasn’t just that he was handsome—he was, with a fragile, captivating beauty—but the way my body reacted: an electric tingling over my skin, my palms sweating, and a new need to approach him, to hear his voice, to smell his T-shirt up close, to feel our arms brush.

He held my gaze, and for a moment the airport din vanished. Did he feel something similar? I’ll never know. A voice announced his flight; I watched him rise with his family and knew I would never see him again. Yet as he walked away, he turned his head once more toward me. He was still looking. I sat petrified, heart pounding. I held his gaze until the last second, until he vanished into the crowd. Then I exhaled, realizing I’d been holding my breath. I felt both dazed and euphoric.

Mom, sitting beside me, noticed nothing; she was reading a magazine, unaware of the silent revolution that had just shaken me. That brief encounter confirmed what I already suspected: it wasn’t just Adrien, it wasn’t a passing idea. My desire—my love—was directed toward other boys. And for the first time, instead of guilt, I felt a spark of pure authenticity ignite inside me.

# 6. Mom’s Comfort

That spark of self-acceptance wasn’t enough to dispel all my fears. Back home, I resumed my routine of silences and forced smiles. Adrien had changed schools and almost stopped seeing me; our friendship faded with distance, leaving the bittersweet taste of a first love that slips away before it is born. At fifteen I was a reserved boy with a secret world beating beneath a calm exterior. Mom sometimes saw an unnamed sadness in my eyes. Intuitive as ever, she sensed something was wrong, but she respected my silence.

One early morning I could no longer contain the pressure in my chest. I had spent the day feeling especially alone—maybe adolescence, hormones, or simply the weight of so many hidden thoughts. I sought refuge in my room and tried to sleep, hugging my pillow as usual, but that night the usual comfort never came. Tears began to fall and I couldn’t stop them. It was a low, almost silent cry, but in the stillness of the night any sob is deafening.

Mom opened my door carefully, lit only by the hallway’s dim light. She found me curled up on the bed, clutching a tear-soaked pillow. Without a word she slipped into bed beside me, as she did when I was little, and wrapped me in a warm embrace.

*“Do you want to tell me?”* she whispered, using the soft voice that always chased my storms away.  
I shook my head, unable to meet her eyes. How could I explain the whirlwind inside me? I feared the truth would hurt her—or worse, disappoint her. But being there, in her arms, gave me back the sense that nothing bad could happen.

*“It’s okay if you don’t want to talk,”* she said, kissing my forehead. *“I just want you to know that I love you exactly as you are, son. Nothing could change that, do you hear? Nothing.”*

Her voice broke on the last word, showing she was speaking from the heart. I clung to her tighter, feeling the words I didn’t dare say spill into that embrace. In silence I asked forgiveness for not being the perfect son she might have imagined; in silence I begged her never to let me go.

*“I love you, Mom,”* I finally murmured in a whisper.  
Her hand traced slow circles on my back, just as when I was a child frightened by nightmares, her thumb making a cross on my forehead.  
*“And I love you, my life. Always,”* she answered, resting her cheek on my head.

We spoke no more—there was no need. I fell asleep with my face against her chest, exhausted but at peace, listening to the steady beating of her heart. Before drifting off, her last words echoed in my mind: *I love you exactly as you are.* Mom didn’t know it, but that was precisely what I needed to keep from collapsing—the certainty that, whatever my truth, her love would remain intact. That certainty became the compass guiding my idea of love in the years that followed me into adulthood.

The next morning no secret was revealed, no question asked. Mom smiled gently at breakfast, and I understood her complicit silence was her way of giving me space. I realized that, too, was a form of love.

That same morning, before heading to school, I paused at my bedroom door. I looked at the rumpled bed: the pillow still damp with night-time tears and, on the wrinkled sheets, timidly poking out, the old plush toy of my childhood that I had rescued from the closet sometime in the night. The sight overwhelmed me. For a moment, the child I had been and the young man I was becoming met in that reflection: both hugging something so as not to feel so alone, both silently longing for a love that had not yet arrived.

The scene repeated itself years later, tinged with more bitterness. Just as in childhood I had fallen asleep clutching my teddy bear for safety, as an adult I found myself crying in the early hours, hugging a pillow in a cold bed.",1,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idk why but we’ve always just had a thing where we automatically put our calls on speakerphone whenever we’re together. This was never something we’ve explicitly talk about doing, we’ve just both always done it since we started dating, although sometimes it does lead to some awkward or at least interesting moments. 


So as usual, he put his mom on speaker, unbeknownst to her and she goes, “did you see my text??” 

Bf: “uhh… no?”

Her: “well, what color of Mickey ears would she want so I can buy her some for our trip.” (they invited me to go on their Disneyland trip with them in a few weeks)

Bf, glancing over at me, grinning: “either yellow or pink.” 

She then continues by asking about our plans with his sisters and if a certain ring would be ready by the time of the trip. 

Bf: “hey mom, I gotta call you back later I’m in the middle of dinner… love ya!” 


It’s such a simple but sweet gesture that she thought to get me something for their trip to Disneyland even though they’re already paying for everything, I can’t stop smiling just thinking about it! I’m going to be marrying into an amazing family soon, and I just had to get it off my chest how ecstatic I am!!

gzc8wb,1591663247,6/9/2020 0:40,self,I can do this.,"I’ve failed a lot in life.
I’ve known a lot of pain in my life. I say that reluctantly as a 21 year old white man living in 2020. Others have known worse pain than mine.
However I’ve learned to validate my own pain. Nobody will do that for you, so you need to do that on your own. I’ve realized that nobody cares. That helped me a lot in life. Upon realizing these things I’ve learned that I need to take the proper steps to further my life. On my own. Because nobody is going to do it for me.

Believe it or not that’s actually pretty difficult. I’ve been smoking weed since I was twelve years old. I’ve had depression as long as that, and recently I’ve developed a form of anxiety. Undiagnosed on all fronts. 

When I was around 16 my parents finalized their divorce. It was a long time coming, I remember the fights more than anything. They actually split up once before when I was about 5 years old. They should’ve just stayed split up. 

I joined the marine corps right out of high school. That was a mistake. I don’t know why I thought the marine corps of all things would fix my depression. Despite it being a mistake, I actually loved my time in the corps. I fit in well. A pretty solid marine. I joined in August of 2017. Got to my unit in February of 2018 as an 0311 Rifleman. I learned how to party, how to fight, I learned the meaning of honor, courage and commitment, and I learned how to set up a complex ambush. I was 19. I drank more alcohol than I thought humanely possible. I woke up in a puddle of my own piss and vomit, ran three miles and did it again that night. I’ve had sex with more women than I care to count. The marine corps made me the man I thought I wanted to be. 

But I left.

I went UA. For those unaware, UA is an acronym in the Navy and Marine Corps standing for Unauthorized Absence. It is the same thing as the more commonly known AWOL, or Absent WithOut Leave, in the Army and Air Force. I went UA because I felt my life crumbling. 

What I didn’t tell you is that boot camp is secretly a money grab. They pay you while you’re there, but they fail to tell you that you’ll be spending some of it while aboard MCRD. They also like to get you really tired through strenuous activity, and then sit you down in an air conditioned classroom so they can talk to you about Navy Federal’s credit card. Which every new marine gets approved for. Needless to say, when they handed out the paper to sign up, I didn’t know what I was signing up for. I was so damn tired. Prior to this I’ve always told myself that I wouldn’t get a credit card. I didn’t have the discipline for it. I’d fuck my life up. Well sure enough, I was home on leave just after graduating boot camp, and my new credit card came in the mail. With a limit of 17 thousand dollars.

Yeah that all got used on Taco Bell and beer.

Also I have debt on a car that I no longer have and I owe the marine corps money for going UA. Total debt is above 60 thousand dollars.


I should have killed myself a long time ago.

And believe me I’ve thought about it.


But that’s not how I think anymore. 

That’s not how I ever should have thought. 

You know what? I’m fucking smart, dude. And I’m able to do the things that I set my mind to. And I can tell you right now, I’m glad I went through that. I’m glad I made the mistakes and bad decisions that I’ve made. I’ll never make them again. I’ll never get into a commitment and back out of it again. I left when the going got tough, and that will never be me again.

Today, I’m 21. Not much older, a little bit wiser. I have an amazing girlfriend whom I share my life with, and I’m enrolled in university, studying Political Science with a concentration in Pre Law. My girlfriend’s Canadian and the border is closed, so when I goto college back home, I won’t be able to see her again until the border opens. I’ve been staying with her. So to make sure I have a bed, I’ll be living in the dorms here on campus. If I get overwhelmed, I’ll take a class or two off my schedule.

But I will not fucking quit.

Oh no.

I’ve learned my lesson on being a quitter. I’ve had family members, former friends ridicule me. People who don’t even know me, but held me to this ridiculous standard because I was a marine, ridicule me for leaving the corps. I’ll have no more of that. I will prove to myself and to the rest of my family that I can do what I set my mind to.

My end goal, become a lawyer. More specifically, a civil rights attorney. I would also be interested in becoming a district attorney. I have a long, long road ahead of me. When the going gets tough, I won’t leave, but I will get going.

Y’all yesterday was crazy! My mom tried calling a dozen times before I blocked her number. Never picked up once. Same with dad. Then my brother called. Told me how disappointed he was with me and how he can’t believe id just turn my back on them even when they “accepted your life of sin” since god hasn’t “fixed” me yet. I told him to never contact me again and hung up. Went on to block the rest of them after that just to protect my sanity. Also received a call from my therapist saying my folks had called her asking fir information and she wanted to see if i was ok. Had a long talk with her that made me feel more human. Spent the rest of the night watching movies and eating cake. Life feels strange and bright today but im looking forward to a long and happy life. Thanks for all the well wishes and support 



My (27 non-binary) parents don’t realize they’ve lost me. Over the last year I’ve grown more and more distant. I transferred my car title so that my father isnt a co-signer on it, closed the bank account my mother helped me open, transferred my phone plan to a new carrier, and moved out. 

On Friday they Will receive a letter in the mail containing the bank card my dad gave me for emergencies and a letter. Letter and tell them that I’m done. Done being the family scape goat.

After 27 years of abuse  they have lost the right to be called my parents and on Friday they will know they’ve lost their youngest child

EDIT: 
People seem confused on the abuse as i didnt add many details on that and rather than simply replying in the comments ill put this here. My parents do not believe in medicine which has lead to broken bones not being treated, serious illness being ignored, and serious chronic health conditions that will effect me for the rest of my life. Along with medical abuse there has been physical and verbal abuse and two separate attempts to deem me medically incompetent.  For those who are concerned about where i am [REDACTED_NAME] i am [REDACTED_NAME] living with my partners and working from home.  Thanks for all the well wishes and concerns for my safety i will update you all on how it goes ❤️",1635,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8r0fg1,1528967898,6/14/2018 9:18,confession,When I was in highschool I catfished a guy I hated and found out he was into furry/bestiality porn,"So I grew up in a small town with a small school system (250 graduates) and there had been one kid that plagued me practically 5th grade to senior year. He was mean, dismissive, and always made a point to put me down or call me stupid. Anyways through a friend of a friend of a damn friend I found out this kid had an edgy ass tumblr account. 

MFW: https://goo.gl/images/LLwMWt

The night of this discovery, I hatched a plan. I made a fake tumblr account calling myself Stacy (it’s not my name) and saying I was from California (it feels like everyone’s from there) and posting typical girl tumblr stuff, getting followers, etc. 

I basically spent a week concocting and grooming this fake account of mine - there couldn’t be any flaws. 

Once I felt like my mask had been adequately made I popped him a PM

“Hey I like your profile pic, is that you?  ;-)” 

I waited for what seemed like hours, checking and rechecking my account to make sure there was absolutely no way he can tell it was me. Suddenly, my inbox notification lit up:

“Yeah, wanna see more ;-)” 

Success. 

For the next few days I had texted this kid, digging into his personal life and his secrets, trying to find anything that would give me a leg up on him. It didn’t take long for him to get comfortable with an anonymous girl with the thirst he had, and things started to get....fuzzy. 

I’ll never forget it. I was up in bed, getting a little sleepy, when he messages me: 

“Hey can I ask you a question?”

Hm okay. I respond “Sure, go for it” 

He takes a while to type but finally it comes out: 

“Do u got any fetishes?”

I look at the time - 1 a.m. 
Ah yes, the peak thirst hour

Though I was feeling a little uncomfortable to be discussing this with a greasy fellow I knew, I decided to trek on.

Thinking of the first fetish that comes to mind, I quickly respond “Ya I love tentacle porn”

Without hesitation he responds “Oh..here’s mine..” and links me to his alt tumblr account: Pages upon pages of drawn furry porn, gifs of people screwing animals (actual animals guys) and even a few pictures of him in cat ears and a tail. To say the least, I was shocked, and it almost hurt to look. 

After that I never responded. He continued to send me a few frantic messages but stopped after a few days. In school I struggled sitting across from him, knowing of the secret alias he lead. 

I had uncovered a goldmine of blackmail, but with such a prize came the curse of having to bear the knowledge that this kid wanted to screw animorphs and horses.

In the end, it was too cringey to even blackmail him with it, let alone tell anyone else about it. I just couldn’t go through the awkward exchange that would be telling him it was me the whole time, and then have to go to school with him for another year. And when you think about it, we both kind of lost there.

But I don’t care. 

Screw you, Kyle, you were mean and I’ve seen those weird ass pics of you and your fetish 

TL;DR: Kid was mean, made account to catfish, uncovered dark furry secret, didn’t tell anyone in end

tt1nn3,1648738787,3/31/2022 14:59,TrueOffMyChest,COVID made me realize I was horrible to my husband. I thought I 'settled' when I married him. I was a bad girlfriend and wife. I'm going to be different from now on.,"My husband didn't excite me when we were together. There were never big ups or downs. He wasn't mysterious, he didn't seem indifferent and he didn't play games. Other boyfriends were investors who racked up credit card charges on credit cards for impromptu getaways to the islands or Europe. My husband is an advanced practice nurse, saved his money and planned. I was so bored, but I hated being alone. So I married him. My mom told me it was a mistake. My father told me it was the best decision. My friends figured we'd get divorced after 12 months. He had student debt from his doctoral program. We weren't living the high life. I was 28 and wanted to be young and free. He was talking about health insurance. I liked him, but I didn't think I loved him. 

I got annoyed with him all the time. I was quick to snap at him. He would go out of his way to be kind and while I was appreciative, I didn't realize how kind he was. I took for granted that I was 'owed' that experience and he was just fulfilling his obligations. I really

Then COVID hit. 

I was obsessively worried about him. I couldn't calm down and I couldn't figure out why I was so amped. He works in surgery and the ICU and has really technical skills, so he was being deployed to help with the influx.   When I couldn't reach him one day I got so stressed out that I threw up and passed out. For much of 2020 I missed my period, I couldn't sleep and eventually my hair was falling out. The only time I was ""okay"" was when I could physically see him. I realized then how shitty I had been. I got into therapy. 

I realized that every guy who had been flashy, a big spender and cool and mysterious were scam artists/a man child looking for attention or a leech. They were throwing around money they didn't have. None of those couples are still together. 

The couples that threw around money and spent without care are destitute and no longer together. 

The couples with the big ups and big downs are broken up. None of them could make it work. 

The only couple going strong is the one I was certain was destined to fail. 

The big ups and downs take an emotional toll on you. They weaken the bonds of your relationship. Volatility is bad. My mom is like that. Extreme swings, constant need for excitement in a relationship or its ""boring."" Stability is bad, so she's always looking for instability. It's something I thought was normal. 

I like ""boring."" I like that we save for vacations and I am [REDACTED_NAME] his health insurance. I like that he is sweet and emotionally available. The ""boring"" guy does laundry, cooks, cleans and is a full-fledged adult with interests and goals and ambitions and passion. We have a marriage where we are together. We support each other and I have never felt as free to be vulnerable ever. 

I was horrid. I was cold. I looked down on him. I can't believe how unhappy I was. Hopefully he never finds out about the things I said. It would be cosmic justice if he left me. Now I worry about that. I just hope he doesn.t",18883,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

r6z4mi,1638420472,12/2/2021 4:47,stories,Children of the storm.,"Right now I remembered a conversation I had five years ago when I was a camp counselor in the USA, my best job experience so far even though I worked 24/6, couldn't drink, my crush got sent back home on session three, man I missed her a lot, and I couldn't say goodbye to her because I was standing guard and no one wanted to switch, I had to clean pipes, and scrub crap from the floor. 

How come it was so good? How come I enjoyed it so much?

Anyway, I was at the sportsfield one day, and a storm came, thunder, lightning, small, nothing out of the ordinary, the rain was mild, the thunders were quite weak, and the lightning...meh, or so I thought.

In the middle of the sportsfield, hidden whithin the shed we used to store all the equipment, to where I was going to store our mats in which we had practiced some judo throws with the kids that I sent on their way to safety, I found  Aadhya, an Indian counselor, curled in the floor, grabbing her knees, sobbing and from time to time covering her ears to avoid the sounds of the storm I am [REDACTED_NAME] fond of.

""What's wrong?""- I asked, not realizing she was terrified of the weather.

""I am [REDACTED_NAME] of thunderstorms, and this is one of the largest I have ever seen, they said it was going to be the storm of the decade in the weather forecast""- She answered.

And I felt two things I remember, one, tenderness, to see someone whom I thought so outgoing and daring being reduced to a childlike state gave me the urge to hug her, she was like a child who has seen the dark for the first time and runs to her father's arms in search for safety.

The second one was confusion, this was a small storm, mild if I am [REDACTED_NAME] generous, nothing compared to the average thunderstorm from where I come from, and then it hit me, my home province, down there, in Argentina, has been deemed as the place with the worst thunderstorms in the world, violent, lasting, hail the size of tiny fists knocking glass, blunting metal, cracking tiles of roofs and the skulls of the unaware, and thunder that lasts for hours.

""Why are you not afraid"" She asked.

""Because I am [REDACTED_NAME] my friend, from where  I come from this is but a mere rainy day where you still play football in the fields and we still go out to party if it is indoors""- And as I sat down next to her I continued my story- ""Were I am [REDACTED_NAME] the storms last hours if not days, they come as they please and no one can tame them, we carry them whithin, a thunderstorm is a sign of a night with pleasant sleep if you have a roof over your head and don't have crops to worry about

We are accustomed to this weather because this weather is somehow part of what makes us unique, we are the heart of Argentina and our weather in a way symbolizes the nature of our nation, and although we are far from the capitol, we believe we are the true spirit of the nation, and we try to embody its values, loyalty, kindness, friendship, optimism, and resilience, the storm outside can not be tamed, but the storm we carry whithin is a journey of a lifetime, after all, what are Cordobessians if not children of the storm?""

And we sat down until she felt brave enough to grab my skinny arm and walk to the dinning hall.

17sle3w,1699672073,11/11/2023 3:07,stories,Assault?,"Is my experience valid?
When I was in 6th grade I rode the bus to and from school. There was a guy who was in the year above me who also rode the bus. He always got into trouble at school, but he was still popular. One day he joined me in my bus seat, and I always sat alone. I didn’t want him to be there because I didn’t know him and I thought he was annoying. I told him not to sit by me, but he didn’t listen. He did it throughout the following week and one day he started scooting closer to me. He put his hand on my thigh, and I told him not to. He didn’t listen, and he started moving it up a little, and I threw his arm off of me. I yelled at him to get up and move and he did. But what I really remember is how the people around me on the bus didn’t do anything. Boys, who were older than me, and his friends sat there and watched it happen. I felt scared and helpless because people who could’ve done something, didn’t. They just looked at me with some sort of concern in their eyes, but that was it. I didn’t realize what it was at the time, but reflecting on it now I felt violated. 
Then 3 years later, in my freshmen year, the same guy touched my shoulder. I think his friends just told him to go up to some random girl and ask her a question. The way he got my attention, though brought back all of the feelings I had as a 6th grader. At this point in my life I realized what he made me feel and all of the helplessness I felt when I was 12 came crashing back to me. I had been unwillingly touched by the same boy twice in my life. He had put me in a situation where others watched and did nothing about his treatment toward me again. This time his friends laughed. They didn’t know what he did to me. I doubt he even remembered what he did to me. 
Yet these interactions feel so small compared to what other women go through in their life that I’ve never shared it with anyone. Because why would being touched on the shoulder trigger me? With the second interaction there was no sexual meaning behind it, he wanted to make a joke of me sure, but nothing sexual. But to this day the way the boys around me reacted stays with me and shapes the way I interact with every man I meet. Because how would they react if it was their friend? I remember his name and face, and I don’t think I’ll ever forget them. I needed to tell someone my story because it’s been weighing on me since.",1,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1jspnlk,1743928852,4/6/2025 8:40,confession,I used to steal from Walmart when I was in my 20s to commit return fraud,"I used to work as a vendor inside of Walmart for an obsolete company back about 10 or so years ago. I took the job to get away from an extremely toxic boss. The job I took was selling a not-so-popular product inside of Walmart, and, due to the obsolescence of the product, it backfired on me.

Well, those bills started coming due. Specifically, it was my phone bill that was the most pressing. I had Cricket for my cell phone plan. I had already stripped it down to the absolute lowest I could go and still couldn't pay it but needed it for work and to find new work. So I thought up this brilliant idea to steal small and very low value mundane things from the Walmart store I was working in. I knew electronics, cosmetics, health aides, toys and groceries would be watched by store security but not the insignificant things I was taking. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about like batteries for cordless phones that nobody really used anymore, or the two-packs of gel pens which were some of my favorites to take due to their size and relatively decent value, and other low value mundane things that I could *quickly* sneak up my sleeve under a shelf and out of the view of cameras. These were things that were all like $10 each or less. Every time I went on break, I'd hide the thing I got in my car and then would take another thing in the same way at the end of my shift. I would get about $15-$30 worth of mundane merchandise each day I worked.

I then returned all the merchandise back to customer service at a different Walmart without a receipt to get an in-store credit. I was able to use that in-store credit to then buy a Cricket prepaid card and my phone bill ended up paid. That was of utmost importance so that, yes, my current employer could call me, but also, more importantly, so that prospective employers could call me. So I was able to keep the scheme going and was able to use the gift cards to buy groceries and I paid one or two more cell phone bills out of it. 

I was desperately trying to find a new job though because even though I was doing that out of pure necessity, I have integrity and so I certainly didn't enjoy doing it by any means and wanted to stop the very SECOND that I could. And I did. The moment I didn't NEED to do it anymore, I stopped and never did the act again. But I look back on that dark time and I regret it but I also kind of don't at the same time. I know it wasn't the right thing to do but I wasn't doing it for pleasure. I did it to simply survive. There wasn't much else I knew to do at the time. I didn't think of getting a second job and gig apps weren't really a thing even then. I was so thankful that I didn't get caught but I know that I deserved to.

On a side note, the obsolete company I was a rep for still exists today selling the same obsolete product. They stay in business somehow.",291,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I sent her a message, and she responded. Then I wished her a Happy Thanksgiving. Somehow, two messages over the course of a week were “too much.”

What really irritated me was when she had her friend tell me to leave her alone.

All I said was, “Happy Thanksgiving,” to which she responded, “Thank you so much! I hope you had a great day.” I simply asked how her day was after that.

Long story short, this whole situation made me shake my head and think, Now I know why she’s single.

1i1mw10,1736906636,1/15/2025 2:03,stories,"Eldest sister got pregnant by my other elder sister’s boyfriend. Around 10 years later, their cracks are starting to show. ","I (26M) come from a pretty big family. My parents came to America from Europe when they were in their early 20s. After settling in, they had 6 kids total. This is about my older two sisters. 

When I was 15, my sister Joy (27F) started dating Tim (30M). The family really liked Tim. He was funny, kind, and had a promising future. I saw how much Joy loved him and how loving he was to her back. Everyone saw how much their love was strong, or at least we thought. 

When I was 16, I was watching the Disney channel with my younger sister since she was 6 at the time and it was nighttime on a Friday. Suddenly, I saw Joy pass by and slammed the door to her room. Joy never EVER slammed doors, even when she was in a bad mood. Before I could get up, my parents came in and told my younger sister to go play or watch TV somewhere else. After she left, my parents sat down and started talking.

Earlier that day, Joy was at her part time job on her break at her part time job when her friend told her something shocking. Our older sister, Jessica (32F) was pregnant and came out of a doctor’s office with Tim. Curious, her friend followed them and saw them make out in the car. The friend took photos and a video of them and showed them to Joy.  After learning this, it took a few seconds for it to sink in. My mom looked like she was about to cry while they told me while my dad barely made eye contact. 

To say the fall out was massive is an understatement. Jessica came back from work one day for dinner (she lived with a friend to be closer to her college). That’s when my parents confronted her about her pregnancy with Tim. After denial, Jessica admitted she was pregnant with Tim’s baby. They had been meeting up secretly for 5 months before she got pregnant. Joy started to sob and scream at Jessica at how she could do this to her. My older brother Jacob, (30M), started yelling too. I just sat back since I didn’t know what to do. After what felt like an hour, Jessica packed the rest of her belongings and left. 

After a week, she contacted me and said if we were still good. She was mistaken that my silence meant I was going to have a relationship with her still. I just told her I didn’t want anything more to do with her and blocked her. 

In a previous post, I said Jessica contacted me a while ago about how Tim was pissed about their recent gender reveal. After the fall out, Jessica married Tim and had their first daughter and another daughter in the summer of 2023. She’s now pregnant with another daughter. Tim is pissed because he wanted a son. Then, just yesterday, Jessica’s MIL contacted me through Facebook if it was true Joy and her husband, Alex (30M) were having a baby boy (they are). I didn’t respond until my wife (25F) started to get harassed. I told Jessica’s MIL to leave my wife out of this. I don’t know why she wants to know why Joy and her husband are having a boy, but I’m not hopeful it’s for any good intentions.  ",2849,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eu6mod,1580044943,1/26/2020 13:22,self,My story about how I turned from an obsessed Fan to a depressed hater (Very long message),"Hello. I am [REDACTED_NAME] germany and recently turned 24 years old. There is something that happened to me a time ago, and, even though this story may be very boring, I want to share it. This goes especially to younger people who are somebody's Fan. Because everyone thinks being a fan is a great thing that makes you happy. But at least for me, that was not the case. There was a pressure, an addiction. It almost ruined me. That's why I want to share my story, I want to show you how wrong it can go. and that it can be dangerous to get addicted to a person. When you're somebodys Fan, you create a different version of that person in your head. Your imagination is ALWAYS different from what is real, because at first you only know their image or what you think it is. Then you fill up everything else with how you want it to be. It is so clear this can only be a lie. So now i want to share this message especially for younger people, so they open their eyes. I don't hope anyone else makes similar experiences like i did, the greatest thing would be if i can prevent someone from going through the same. I have never told this anyone, not even my parents know I was Fan and everything after. So here's a story of my youth , a secret that will maybe define me for the rest of my life:

Everything started a long time ago. I was still a child. Only 9 years old. I started to discover music on the radio. I liked a lot. But I was fascinated by one voice and a song I absolutely loved. They finally mentioned the artists name on the radio. (I forbid his name now!) Later I got more songs (like 5)  from radio and I liked them all. I really liked his voice. I did not know who he was, if he was a band, how old he was, and who he really is. But I wanted more, I wanted to know every Song. So I asked my parents about who it was. 

As my Mom mentioned he’s there since the 80s and must be like 40, I was a little surprised, but I didn’t care. A year later, in 2007, I was 11 at that point,- I discovered another radio station. They had a Radiocomedy about this singer. I LOVED it! So, this is how I became a Fan. I started collecting every song I could get. And newspaper articles, mentions in the radio, Tv gigs, interviews… really EVERYTHING! I was obsessed with that singer! Well, at least with what I thought what he was. In my young brain, I made him to something very different than he was in real. And I never thought that there might be something wrong with him. No child or teen comes to the idea, that their Idol could do or say something they don't like. At least I did not. I created my own version of him in my head without even noticing it. This is something a lot Fans do, and it is dangerous! You'll see why. First shocking things for me as an ongoing (wannabe) fangirl: Hearing an old song. I never liked it. I couldn’t recognize one of my favorite singers. But well, this song is so old, I didn’t care much. Another shocking thing was when some radioguy said he would be a band. I was like WTF he is uninformed and takling shit - who’s the fan here, right? … I created a picture of a singer that doesn’t really exist. I remember I imagined stories… Anyway, this should stay with me for many many years … I remember when I was 12 he won some price and it came on Tv, but very late, I couldn’t watch it because the other day was school. Man, I cried so hard that night! That was how important it was to me. … When I was 13 I got my first Laptop and Internet. Then it started going really worse. I did nothing else than googling that singer! I found so many songs on youtube. So many new things. The addiction really began! … I didn’t mind if a song, or the half of them, was bad,- there were so many I had to discover. I was so obsessed. Way more than about other artists i always liked. I was collecting and collecting…. 

When I was 14 I had a really very hard time. I was bullied at school. I felt ugly, wrote bad marks. I had a teacher who always made me down. And I had no friends at all. I Had noone, I was lonely. So I needed something to hold on. Being the Fan was something that distracted me from reality. I had something to hear and watch on my laptop. I imagined stories, I made my own, better truth. I didn’t realize it back then. … I edited all the articles because i didn’t like it that way. I built castles in the air and matched everything the way i wanted. Online I also found a Fan Community, in which I instantly had to get in. So I learned how the ""real Fans"" are. Most of his Fans were Housewifes in their mid 40s, drooling over his look, knowing all the dirty details, loving the 80s stuff, hating the new music. Talking just about a band. And then there was me. A 14 year old girl, who highly prefered the newer songs and had totally different views and taste.  

And what I had to read and experience there for the next 2 years was not pretty! I really hoped to finally find people who like me and a place where i belong. But all they did was not taking me serious. “You are just a dumb teen, you don't know""… how ofted did I have to read this… They hated about my favorite songs, Fans! I couldn\`t understand it. There also were so many fights between users. And I was always their favorite target. They told me I\`d have a bad taste and broken ears. They were rude and they insulted me i would be just a rebellious teen. What? No! All I ever wanted was to be included. I tried so hard, but they always disrespected me. I cried so many nights, really! In the end they kicked me out, forever. I haven't done something bad, I just was cyberbullied,- by people who had children in my age. I can't tell how this hurt me. I was 16 or 17 when it ended like that. My situation was the worst. Bullied at school for 6 Years, no friends, and finally a community that i wanted to belong to more than anything else disaccepted me and bullied me out.  It depressed me, but I kept hanging on to it. Later, somebody wrote me a Facebook message. I think I was 16, that guy was a few years older. I had a fanpage on facebook i was building up at that time. That guy who wrote messages to me SEEMED really nice. He told me he understands me. There was also a girl in my age who was really nice. We 3 build a chatgroup on fb. For more than a year we were chatting nearly everyday. They were also  fans, I could talk to them, it was nice. I THOUGHT they were my friends. They knew everything about me! That guy always pretended to me that we are soulmates and that he can't imagine life without me, bla bla… But then, he started to change. He started to tell rumors about that singer I never heard of. He had views that were… strange! He started to denigrate my favoritesongs too. I remember we had endless long discussions. He tried to tell me why my favoritesongs are bad. He told me things I didn't like, I didn't want to hear. I always told him to stop, i feel bad and it hurts. But he continued.  The other girl in the chat got more and more on his side. In the end We were in a fight. Finally that guy kicked me out and closed the group. I was so damn sad.  He later told me: “And someTHING like you wants to be a fan? Grow up out of your barbie world, your are dead to me.” I newer recieved a message that hurt me so much! …

Later when I was 17, I bought a real CD. I usually don't buy CDs. But I did it just to prove that I am a real Fan. I needed it. I think when you have to prove yourself to be a Fan, you're not a true Fan. …

When I was 17/18, things in my personal life got better. I was at a new school.  But on the other side the time of doubt started. Fandoubts. Thoughts like: Am I really a fan?, have I ever been a fan? Why can't I belong into this Fandom?, are the things true that they say? How did he (singer) mean ABC in Interview XYZ? And so on afflicted me so bad. I searched for 1000 answeres but I only found more and more questions! My mind started to evolve just around all that. I felt so helpless, unsure, worried and alone. In 2014 all I have seen was fans bitching around in the internet, trying to ruin my life. Then there were news about a collaboration with someone else I didn't like. I never thought it was possible. And the worst thing is, I was in holidays when these news came. It literally ruined my holidays, because it made my doubts stronger. I was so sad, angry and frustrated about everything!  Though everything was great in my life, I was really depressed. Depressed because of what some stupid Rockstar I normally couldn't care less about, maybe does. I made something part of my life that has nothing to do with my life. Really, I was so sick. I was addicted! I needed to know everything. All that was not how I wanted, depressed me. I could have been the happiest, but all i did was relying my luck on something that wasn't even real. … So, I also still had this Fanpage. I got creative. I edited Videos and Pictures. I created little cartoons and so on. I taught myself in software like Photoshop. I created alternate albumcovers, I even wrote articles. It was fun, well, until fan’s reactions came. They never recognized my work. They stole them and copied them all over the internet. Whenever I said that it was my edit, they only got rude, did not believe me and told me I don’t may claim it was “mine”. It frustrated me so much how many of my edits got stolen. Also my speachbubble-Jokes and cartoons were never appreciated. For me it was like an homage to the old Radiocomedy I loved so much. But I just got disrespectful messages of fans who didn’t understand it. In the end, I lost my enjoyment about everything I did there. I went on talking about my views and feelings. If it was why I like one song, if it was why I can’t understand why everybody still lives in the 80s and hates the newer songs which were my favorites, if it was a complaining of something I didn’t understand, if it was one of my doubts, or rumours I didn’t want to believe….. I wanted to talk to Fans, I wanted to have a nice community of people at my wavelength. But it never ever worked. All I recieved was hate! Right, on my own page! Again people told me that I’m dumb, have a bad taste, no knowlege, that I’m too young to be a fan…. They said go and get help. Hello? WHAT THE FUCK WAS I DOING RIGHT HERE?!?! Nobody even tried to understand and to help me out. All they ever did is making it harder!!!  The next and last place where I tried to find a place was Tumblr. And I have to say, on Tumblr, there are the most pervert Idiots I have ever seen. I could never understand those drooling over his look type of fans. Though I’m female I was never like that. They only think of sex all the time. There was not a single Fan blog I liked. So I tried to make the best one my own. At the beginning it was ok. But then they started insulting me again. I remember one day, they started pseudo including me after I complained how I was never accepted in this fandom. They started an introducing action, hell it was so stupid. The only answeres I got were rude, and they just got more together, excluding me. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore!

In early 2016, I was just turned 20, the bomb finally exploded. I watched an interview. I’ve seen it 100 times before. But there was one sentence I always missed. Maybe, cause my english wasn’t that good in the past. I heard him say something I couldn’t believe. So I googled it and digged a little deeper. I figured out it was true. It gave me explanations for so many things. I finally had to realize, that all of the things I never wanted to believe are true, that everything I always believed in and loved was not true. I realized many things that time. Also that many of them Fans were right, unfortunately. And that I am [REDACTED_NAME] biggest idiot. I feel still ashamed. I hated my self. But I started to hate the singer! What it all made me is really SICK! And depressive! All 2016 I was on a hate trip, and new songs couldn’t save me. The lyrics are crap anyway. If you ask me now, I’d say: He is not a band, but it also ain’t a singer. He is a business cooperation consisting of an asshole with a fake image! Yeah I finally realized what a unsympathic fake person he is. That made me hate him. He steals all of his songs. He pretends to be about the music, but in fact he is only a businessman who wants to make more and more money. He lies. He doesn’t pay taxes. He hates animals.. etc. I realized it all. And then in all my hurt there remained just pure rage. I was so angry. I started writing hate comments to reveal everything on his social media. I don't know how many fake accounts and bots I started, just to finally let my frustration out. So I found myself as the pure hater. The typical one with 0 selfconfidence and problems with myself. This went on for a year or so. Until I realized that it is not worth it. Because I just waste all my energy on something that isn't good for me. Because it was stuck in my head and i only got nasty comments. I hurt myself over again with it. I had also phantasies to steal all of his CDs in the next store, just to harm him.  It was so hard for me to let go of it! It was really like a drug addiction. I  now hated this singer, but i still couldn't miss any news. I still was googling all the time,- just to get more frustrated. I didn't think it was possible to live without it. How could I live a few weeks without news about him? I tried it often, but i could never stay away longer than 2 weeks. But everytime i came back, i realized how i just hurt myself. Every time i've seen him have success was like a punch in my face. Like, he does not deserve that at all, it is so unfair! It wasn't good for me at all to see all that! The periods of staying away slowly got longer. When I was 22 I finally made a cut. I downloaded everything new i could get without watching it before, just saved it. I put everything I had (Fanpictures, CDs, a 2TB HDD etc..) in a Box and locked it away. Not allowing myself to ever open it again! But I know If I'd ever want to, I could open it. I felt like an alcoholic in rehab! It was so hard for me to not deal with anything about that singer anymore. And I admit, I relapsed a few times, and I googled, or listened to a song. It made me feel bad every time. But as time passes by, it gets easier. Now I don't need it anymore and I'd say I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for almost 2 years right now. But I still wish he was dead, or at least not famous anymore. I still wish him anything bad, that he suffers the same as I did. I don't hear radio anymore, because I don't want to be reminded on this ever again. I really wish I could erase my whole youth. It might be over, but i'm [REDACTED_NAME] not completely over it. When I only see his face I still get rage. I have to keep myself away for the rest of my life. It's crazy how addicted you can be to a person, you don't even know and you don't even really like.  I had even big problems to find a job because i was never interested in something else than him… 

Thank god I’ve never been to a concert. There were times I wanted, but luckily I didn’t, because of my doubts. Every doubt has it’s reason. Now it's the best to never see anything about him again! 

What I learned from this is, that i never want to be a Fan of anything! Being a Fan is stupid, you forget how to think, you are blind and dumb. Atleast that was I. There are a few other musicans I sort of like and if i wanted I could choose to be a fan. But I don't ever allow myself to be any sort of Fan again. I don't want to be interested in any famous person. They are all the same. I've noticed so many similarities with others too. Now I sort of hate them all, I'ts just not my thing.  When ever i start to be interested in some musican, i keep reminding myself on how wrong it can go out. Today i can control it, i realize what i am [REDACTED_NAME] to do and stay away. I guess I've grown up. Now I just listen to what i like and I don't even want to know the artists anymore. Because now I understand, it was all my own fault, and it would have happened with any other singer too! I was lonely and needed some distraction. That's why i fell for this singer. He was just a psychological replacement for something that was missing in my life! I was a victim of myself. I already had big problems which lead to more problems. Not he was the asshole, not the other fans,- I was the asshole. I was the biggest asshole to myself and I didn't even notice it!

So kids, what do you learn from this? Never start being a Fan, especially not such an obsessed fake one like I was. It only causes problems and pain. And don't ever compensate something you don't have with something that ain't real.  Keep your eyes open, be self reflective and don't lose reality.

After all those years and almost 2 more years of staying away from it I want to say I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Maybe not completely healed but clean. I don't need it anymore and 2019 was the best year since a long time because i leaned how to live without it. And the best thing is: I got through alone, I got out without help! 

So, I don't know what answeres to expect. Maybe you experienced something similar, maybe this helped you? No, I guess probably you think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a crazy idiot who wrote a way too long text. And this is very true! So, I wish you have a great day, bye! :)",2,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kgt0gz,1608466180,12/20/2020 12:09,stories,The Spots of al Fahad: Part 3 of 4,"The question came as soon as they were off their horses that evening, before even setting up the camp.  “And now, my friend, it is time for you to answer my question. Who are you?” Ali asked

William sighed.  “I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure.”

“Then make it simple.  Who are you right now?”

He shrugged.  “I’m William de Quince, an English knight a long way from home.  I’m tired and thirsty and ready to strangle an over-aged adolescent who has no capacity to shut up.”   

That produced a laugh, of course.  “Very good.  We can establish who you are more generally at a later time.”

“Is the rest of my story that hard to figure out?”

“I can guess at some general shapes, but none of the specifics.  But that is of little relevance.  What you are willing to say is as important as what I am [REDACTED_NAME] to hear.”

William looked at the ground.  “It doesn’t seem that it should be hard.”

“In good time, sir.  I can wait until you are ready.”  Ali strode off to get water, leaving William to arrange a fire.   

\_\_\_

He didn’t dream of the leopard that night.  He didn’t dream at all. He went straight from wondering if he wanted to dream to the smell of roasting goat.  He turned a gruff expression towards the young man at the fire.  “Don’t you ever sleep?  You were still out wandering the desert when I went to bed.”

Ali looked back over his shoulder.  “Of course I sleep.  I do so with the same enthusiasm that I do everything else and so I need less of it.  Be happy, my friend, and you will not only enjoy life more, you will have more of it to enjoy.”

”Marvelous,” William grumbled.  “Word games.”

“You just don’t like goat meat and the taste of it has soured your mood.”

“There is nothing particularly wrong with goat meat.  There is nothing particularly right about it, either.”

“You think that it is uninteresting?”  Ali grinned.  “I take that as a most serious accusation.”

“It’s not exciting, certainly.”

“What would be exciting?”

“Whatever the leopard eats.”   

“Why the leopard, William?” Ali asked after a sharp bark of laughter.

He shrugged.  “I saw one a couple of nights ago.  It was eying my horse, but it fled when I approached it.”  

“That is interesting, for leopards are not common around here.  I don’t recommend walking up to one, either.”

“They’re even rarer where I come from.  I wanted a closer look.”

“It does take only one to make an impression,” Ali agreed.  “However, in answer to your question, the leopard has a tendency to eat goats.  So we have come full circle.”

“I’ll try to be excited by breakfast, then.”

“That’s the spirit, my friend.”

William frowned.  “That was a very roundabout way to get me to agree to eat the goat.”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] cunning, Faranj.”  Ali inspected the meat and then put it back to roast longer.  “When I met you, I was considering a visit to some of my cousins.  I have decided that perhaps that is still a good idea, if you will accept my invitation to join me there.”

“I’d prefer not to talk to people.  Yourself excepted, of course.”

“Ah, but that is the beauty of it.  None of them speak Greek, so you won’t be able to talk to any of them.”  

“I have a suspicion that you are tricking me somehow,” William replied.

“Tricking you?  Never. It is nearly four days ride to their town.  You can think about it along the way.  If you decide to decline, we can just not travel the last mile.”

William shrugged, unable to form a decent reason to say no.

\_\_\_

The succeeding days went much the same.  Ali joked and cajoled.  William smiled more and had a harder and harder time remaining sullen.  Ali’s attitude was infectious.

The leopard stayed out of his dreams.

Early on the fourth day, Ali reined to a stop at the crest of a low ridge.  A dusty town spread out at the base of the far side.  William looked down on it, the first settlement, the first other people that he had seen in more than a week.   

“Before I ask you whether you wish to meet my cousins, William, I have a different question.  Truly, what brought you from gray, rainy England to this land?”

The knight continued to look down at the buildings silently.  Many minutes passed, perhaps the longest stretch Ali had gone without speaking since they had met.

“My family died,” he said at long last before lapsing back into silence.   

Ali let his horse drift sideways until their knees touched and offered a slight, easy smile of sympathy.

“I had a wife and four daughters.  Other men kept telling me I needed to have a son.  Anne felt guilty about producing only girls.  I suppose I should have felt the same, but when I looked at them I was incapable of disappointment.  They were so beautiful.”

“What were their names?” Ali asked quietly.

“Guinevere was the eldest.  Then Annabelle, Margaret, and Esther.”

“You will have to tell me about each of them, William, and your wife as well.”

He nodded, but made no effort to say more.  

“We will trade stories of our children.”

William tried to say something and his voice cracked several times before he managed it.  “I was gone.  It was summer, five years ago.  We were campaigning in Wales, a part of the island we haven’t conquered yet.  Nothing else had happened in years so everything seemed safe.

“The Vikings came that summer.  Northmen raiders from across the sea.  They don’t raid like they used to.”  He laughed without a trace of mirth.  “Of course not.  The boldest among them conquered Normandy a century ago. Then they conquered England.  Those were my ancestors.  We were the ones manning the longboats.  My family got rich making the same raids.  It has been fifty years since that many of the Northmen assaulted England as did that summer.  We had all thought that the great raids were a thing of the past.   

“We were in the woods when we got word of the raids.  I wish I could say that I had a vision of doom.  I didn’t.  There is so much coastline. My family was on such a small part of it.  I worried briefly, but dismissed it in favor of worrying about my own life.

“It was three weeks before we got word.  My brother’s manor had been sacked.  No mention of who had been killed or who had survived. I felt fear from that point on.  I couldn’t leave then; what would have been the point?  It was all over, one way or the other.  Alive or dead.

“They were dead, of course.  All five of them.  I don’t know how, exactly.  No one alive saw the attack.  It was sunny when we arrived home.  After an entire summer of rain it was sunny, as if God were mocking me.  I never got to see their bodies.  I went straight to their graves in the churchyard.  The five of them are in a little row.  I would go out there in the middle of the night and lie down.  It was almost as if I could feel them sleeping next to me, but it brought no comfort.

“I came to forget.  I wanted to find a place where I didn’t see them behind every tree.  Where I didn’t hear their voices in every room.  I think I was mad.  I wanted to kill.  I’ve never been like that before.  When I was younger I felt the excitement of combat.  That mix of fear and thrill and the conviction that only your skill at arms will see you through the day.

“But I never really wanted to kill.  I have, I think.  I mean, I think I killed back in England.  I know I have here.  But the battles I was in were all so confused that I could never be sure.  I was always just as happy that it was so.  I could pretend that it was just a game.”

“But this was different.  After they died, I did want to kill.  An anger consumed me.  And so I heeded the Pope’s call to come to this land, to free the Holy Land from the heathens.”  His words were bitter.  “That didn’t matter to me, just the promise of death and distance.”

“That’s why I came: to kill.  That it was your people mattered to me not at all.  And I came to die. It would have been better if I had simply resolved to die and skipped the killing.”

“This world makes the killing very easy, William.”  Ali’s voice was soft.  “Maybe it would be better if we all valued each others’ lives more and our own less, but that would be a different world than this one.”

It was as if he didn’t hear.  “It was as if I was possessed.  I can’t claim that it is true.  I can remember making all of the decisions to slaughter, but it is as if I did so at a distance from my own body.”

“You are wrong, William.  You were possessed.  Perhaps not by Shaitan or his servants.  Perhaps it was just that dark side that we all have within us that took you over and wouldn’t let go.”

“Whatever it was, it left me standing in a church of Jerusalem.  I looked down and saw that I stood in blood up to my ankles.  From right there, without turning my head, I could see three bodies that I could remember killing.  Murdering, really.  That’s what it was.

“What have I become?”

“What have you become, William?  It sounds as if you aren’t any different now than you were before.  The question isn’t what you have become.  It’s whether what you were for a time consumes you.”

“Should it not?”  Anguish twisted his face .  Tempeste shifted uneasily as his hands twisted in the horse’s mane.  “Can there ever be enough good deeds to outweigh the things that I have done?”

“Do not think of a balance, my friend.  No action ever removes another.  They are not sums.”

“Are we never rid of our sins?  Do they weigh on our souls for all time?”

“No, William,” Ali said quietly.  “That is not what I mean at all.  We must let go of our sins.  They are not us.”

“You tell me there is no penance to be paid for sins as grievous as I have committed?”

Ali smiled.  “Let me speak at length, for this is not a simple thought.  Of course there is penance to be done.  But it does not wipe away our sins.  They remain a part of us.  Penance serves two purposes.  It should remind us of our sins so that we do not repeat them, and it should offer recompense to those we have harmed.  Not to remove the sin, but because we owe them a debt.”

“But I do not . . .”

Ali held a finger to William’s lips.  “Hush.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] finished yet.  And it is important to realize that just as you cannot wipe away your sins, neither can they wipe away the good that you do.  You remain the person that loved your daughters in a world that does not always prize little girls as it should.   

“William, you were trying to tell me that you cannot offer recompense to those you harmed.  You do not know who they were or how you could help them now that they are dead.”

“I can’t.”  It was a strangled whisper.

“So you must move on.  What’s done is done and you can’t change any of it.  So you must resolve that you will be a good person going forward.  There is no balance for you to achieve.  That’s a senseless idea.  Just be the best man you can be.”

“How do I avoid becoming that beast again?”

“There are two things that will stop you.  The first is your own conscience.  Now you know what you might do in the extremes of despair.  Even without the second thing, I am [REDACTED_NAME] that you would never behave so again.”

William looked at him dubiously.  “I hope the second thing is more reliable than my own conscience.”

Ali laughed, the first sound of happiness since they had stopped on the ridge.  “It is incredibly powerful, William, for that second thing is me.  Even should your conscience fail, I will not let you descend to those depths again.”

“You would kill me first.”  It wasn’t a question.

“Of course not.”  Ali almost giggled.  “I will make you laugh.  That alone will keep you from evil.”

“Is that all it takes?”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] if you feel that I am [REDACTED_NAME] light of your troubles, my friend.  It is just that I see so much good in you that I cannot help but laugh.”

“I’m glad that one of us can.”

“I will teach you about yourself, William.  Before I am [REDACTED_NAME] with you, you will understand the things that I see.”  He turned and looked down at the town.  “Now, do you wish to meet a small part of my family?”

William de Quince thought for a moment.  “I do.”

\_\_\_

As the two of them approached a compound within the town, a group of children emerged, shouting, “Al Fahad!  Al Fahad!”  Ali jumped off of his horse and scooped one of them up in his arms.  He did so effortlessly despite his slight frame.   

The sound rapidly spoken Arabic assaulted William.  He felt a pang as a swarm of kids surrounded his new friend.  In a strange land it seemed so familiar despite his inability to understand any of the words.  Despite the ache, he felt a sliver of joy watching them.

“You are very popular,” he called to Ali over the din.  That seemed to intensify the curiosity that had been growing among the mob about him.  A couple of the older children, looked up at him, obviously wanting to ask him questions.

Ali said something to them that included William’s name.  It induced more laughter.

“I’m afraid to find out what you just told them about me,” William said.

“I told them that you eat bothersome children,” Ali replied.  “They don’t seem to believe me.”

William swung his leg over the saddle in order to dismount.  He was immediately surrounded by children.  “How many of them are there?”

“I don’t know.  They never stand still enough to count.  It’s half a clan.”

“Only half?”

A middle aged man in white robes emerged from the villa.  “Ali al Fahad!” he yelled, followed by more Arabic.  He strode up to the two of them, eyeing William.

As he approached, Ali said, “This is my cousin Mohammed.  Actually he’s my grandnephew, but to keep things simple, everyone becomes a cousin.”

“How many generations have come after you?”

“We’re on number four.  You’re making me feel old.”  He laughed.

“You are old.”

As Ali and Mohammed conversed, William amused himself making faces at a couple of the bolder children.  They giggled and shrieked as he engaged in a more complex pantomime.  They were interrupted by a sharp comment from Mohammed.  The boys ran back into the villa.  William looked at Ali with an expression of worry.  “Did I do something wrong?”

Ali laughed.  “No, my friend.  It is time for afternoon prayers.  The faithful are supposed to pray to God five times a day.”

“You do not.”

“I said that they are supposed to.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] a good Muslim and sometimes fail in the observances when I am [REDACTED_NAME] my own.  However, I honor God in my heart and while I am [REDACTED_NAME], I do my best to adhere to expectations.  So I will go inside now. You are welcome to follow me and I can show you where you can wait for us to be finished.”

William followed Ali into the cool, moist air that lay behind the villa doors. He was left to sit alone beside a fountain in the shaded courtyard, listening to the burbling of the water. A few minutes later a woman brought him a clay goblet.  “Here you are, my lord,” she said in perfect Greek.

William started.  “Ali said no one here spoke Greek.”

“He is often forgetful, my lord.”

William laughed.  “I am [REDACTED_NAME] a third son.  To call me anything more than ‘Sir’ is to elevate me beyond my station.”

“I prefer to err on the side of caution, my lord.”

“Wise, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] William de Quince, minor knight.  Address me however you will. Shouldn’t you be in praying?”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] like you, Sir William.”

“Ah.  If you will stay with me a moment, I would be interested in talking to someone who knows Ali.”  The water was cold and clear and greatly satisfying.

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] in the kitchen, sir.”

He nodded.  “Perhaps later, then.  What is your name?”

The servant gave him a guarded look.  “Haidee, sir.”

“Well then, Haidee, perhaps I will talk to you later.”

“I look forward to it, sir.”   

Haidee left. William got the impression that she didn’t look forward to it at all.

\_\_\_

William spent most of his time at the villa playing with the children, nine boys of various ages.  With them, the lack of a common language proved to be less of a hindrance.  He started the afternoon just wrestling with them.  The sounds of delight filled the courtyard.

After the exertion had finally taken its toll, one of the older boys produced a chess set.  They passed several hours teaching William the game.  It turned into a team sport, as a couple of them helped the foreigner make his moves.  Despite the help, it took him a while to grasp the object of taking the king.  His confusion did not prevent all involved from enjoying themselves.

It was early evening when Ali came out to rescue him from the hoard.  “You have a way with them, my friend.  We have heard the shouts of joy wherever we go.”  He smiled broadly.

William looked embarrassed.  “It was nothing.”

This only drove Ali to laughter.  “Why do you make so little of it?  Your own pleasure has been as audible as Hamid’s.”  Ali grabbed the shoulder of the most rambunctious of the boys.   

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] to being happy,” the Englishman admitted.

“So very true,” Ali replied, delighted.  “If you do not stop playing, you will be so happy that no one will recognize you.  Fortunately, I have come to save you.  It is time for eating.”  He said something in Arabic to the children, who ran off, the eldest hurriedly collecting his chess pieces and board.

William, suddenly famished, followed closely behind Ali..  “What have you been doing while I was playing,” William asked.

Ali made a sour face.  “Being bored, mostly.  Mohammed wanted to know what things I had seen since I last visited.  He is a good merchant and a good father, but deathly dull to talk to.  He cares nothing for the interesting things in life, just the price of dates in Aleppo or the quality of the carpets for sale in Damascus.”

They arrived in the dining chamber after Ali reminded him to remove his shoes.  Once they were eating, William was astonished at the flavors.  After days of goat meat following a lifetime of English food, he delighted in the varied tastes.  He asked Ali the names and ingredients in dishes and sauces.  He was particularly taken with a mint sauce.  Ali laughed when he put it on everything.   

“Do you always eat like this?” William  asked as a third course was brought in.

“No.  They  turn it into a special occasion when I arrive.”

After a while, William became aware of the attention paid to them by Haidee while she helped to serve the meal.  Anytime he looked, she was staring at one of the two of them.  Though she hid it quickly whenever she saw his gaze turn to her, he caught expressions of dislike and as he conversed with Ali he thought he saw jealousy on her face.

Later, after the meal was complete, William seized an opportunity to speak to her.  “Have I done something to offend?”

“No, sir,” she replied.  Her face dropped into a blank expression.

Unconvinced, he continued.  “I apologize for whatever it is.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] we will not be staying long and Ali will take me back out to the desert.”

“I’m sure, sir.”

The jealousy had reappeared for just an instant and William almost gasped with realization.  “You love him, don’t you?”

“You don’t know anything about it, sir.”

“I saw the way you watch the two of us.”

He almost missed the spasm of anger on her face before she suppressed it.  “There is no point in thinking of what cannot be.”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] that the differences between you are so great.”

Haidee almost snarled in return.  “You have no idea what the differences between us are, or aren’t.”

He was taken aback by the open hostility from a servant and then something dawned on him.  “You think he loves me.”

“I know that he loves you.”   

William pondered the implications of that.  “Of all of the obstacles in your path, I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I am [REDACTED_NAME] the one to worry about.”

Haidee glared at him.  “I repeat, you know nothing about this.”  She turned, ready to leave.

“What does al Fahad mean?” he asked.

She looked over her shoulder at him with eyes empty of spark.  “It means ‘the leopard,’” she said in a hollow voice.  

\_\_\_

They spent another day at the villa, and then rode into the desert again.   “You are smiling and laughing easily, William.  Had I known that family interaction would have this effect on you I would have taken you sooner.”

“Thank you, Ali.  You are right.  It was what I needed.”

“Is there something wrong, my friend?  Where are the loud denials of being happy?”

“I give up.  It’s not worth denying.”

“It is obvious that you like people more than you let on.”

William looked down at his saddle.  “The hatred was an aberration..  Before my family died, I was like this most of the time.  You haven’t so much created this new man as you have dug deeply enough to unbury him.”

“That is good.  I have shown you the desert, William.  Now I wish for you to show me the city.  It has been decades since I have been to Jerusalem.  I rarely travel to any large city these days.  I wish to become reacquainted with large masses of people.”

The knight felt uneasy.  “Are you sure?”

“Of course.  I couldn’t bear for it to be known that you were better at meeting my people than I am [REDACTED_NAME] meeting yours.”

“All right.”  

“As we unbury you, William, it is time to put all of your ghosts to rest.  Jerusalem is the place it must happen.  Along the way, tell me of your daughters and your wife.  Let them no longer be a burden on your heart, but share them so that they carry it instead.”

“Are you a poet?”

“Sometimes.  I’ve tried my hand at almost everything over the years.  Except fishing.  I’m afraid of boats.”

William almost choked.  “You’re afraid of something?”

“I am a land creature.  I can cross a river, even swim it, if I need to.  But to go where I can’t see the shore?  That terrifies me.  If the boat sinks, which way would I swim?”

“Any direction will do if you can swim well enough.  You’ll always reach land eventually, if you go in a straight line.”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] by your confidence in my abilities.  Still, there is only one thing that could get me to cross the sea.”

“And what is that?”

Ali looked at him with a sly smile.  “Only if I wanted to go to some place surrounded by the sea, someplace to which I couldn’t walk, would I willingly traverse the water.”

“Like England.”  William’s voice was even.

“Like England.  I will see it someday.”

There was a stretch of silence.  “I don’t think I want to go back,” William said at last.  “Nothing remains for me there except bitter memories.  It is better for me to remain here.”   

“That is understandable, my friend.  If you change your mind, I will accompany you.  If not, I shall make the voyage someday without you.  I am [REDACTED_NAME].  Even if I must wait until you are in paradise, I would see your homeland.”

“Do you truly think that we will be together so long?”

Ali drew his horse to a stop.  “You spoke with Haidee at the villa.”  It was a statement.

“I did.  She is jealous and said things whose meaning was unclear to me.”

Ali chuckled.  “You understood the meaning of them perfectly well, William.  You are merely uncomfortable at that meaning.”

“I suppose.”  He stumbled over his next sentences.  “I mean, I have heard of such things between men.  I have even known a couple . . . I mean, a few . . . who I suspected of lying with each other, but . . .”

Ali’s mirth only grew louder.  “I appreciate your bravery in not shying away from the subject, William, but love can take many forms.  It does not require us to lie together.”

“I suppose, but . . .”  His sentence ended in a sputter.

“Your face has turned a delightful shade reminiscent of a cherry.”

William stopped trying to speak and just glared.

“Haidee was unusually wicked to you, my friend.  I see no need to be embarrassed about the thoughts you are having, but if any of us should be embarrassed, it is her, not you.”

He managed to choke out an answer.  “What do you mean?”

“I enjoy making you puzzle out my secrets, William, but I will share the second with you if only to reduce your confusion.”  Ali repeated the method of dismounting he had shown on their first meeting, flowing through the handstand and then the flip onto his feet.

“Haidee failed to share with you one vital piece of information.  This is the source of your confusion.”  He lifted his tunic over his head.  “I am [REDACTED_NAME], for it allows me to reveal it myself, though I’m sure this will only replace one form of confusion with another.”

As Ali stepped out of his trousers, William regained his voice.  “What are you doing?”  He pulled on the reins, directing his horse away from the undressing Arab.

Ali stood in his shirt and underclothes.  “I am [REDACTED_NAME] you something, silly man.  Something I very much doubt you would believe if I just told you.  Stop running away.  There is nothing to be frightened of.”  He removed the blue shirt, revealing a small pair of breasts.

William watched, transfixed.

“I’m sure you can guess what’s coming,” Ali said.  He took off the last of his clothes, standing in the sand wearing nothing but sandals and a turban.   

Except that ‘he’ was nothing of the sort.  “I am a woman, William.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] truly Ali.  I just go by that in my travels.  My name is [REDACTED_NAME]’ad, which means ‘Bringer of Happiness’ in our language.  My parents named me well, don’t you concede?”

William sat on his horse, unsure what to say.

“May I get dressed again, William?  The sun is very hot today.”

Willilam nodded, unsure of his voice.

“Thank you.”  Is’ad continued to talk as she did so.  “So that is how you should take the revelation that I love you.  Perhaps it shouldn’t make a difference, but to you it does.”

“Why?” William asked at last.

“Have you not learned that that is a broad question that can lead uncomfortable places?  Why do I love you?  Why did I reveal myself just now?”

“Why do you pretend?”

“Ah, you meant it in a simple way.  Is that not obvious?  Does the life I enjoy seem to you like one that the world would allow a woman?”

“No,” he conceded slowly.

“I pretend to be a man because you have a freedom that a woman can never enjoy.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] to roam the desert.  I can make unscheduled stops to visit family.  Do you think that I could have lived a century and more with my life limited in the ways it would be if I remained Is’ad for all to see?”

William shook his head.  “But Haidee knows.  And your son knows.”

Is’ad laughed.  “My whole family knows, and more.  It is not hard to discover that the ancient one who wanders the desert is female, if you are curious.  What I call my secrets were really just secrets from you, not others.”

“But if they know, then how does it work?”

“We pretend.  There are zealots out there who object, but they are few.  There are more who disapprove but lack the courage to say so openly.  I found though, that most people care more for the appearance of propriety than they do for propriety itself.  So long as they can pretend that I am [REDACTED_NAME], they don’t concern themselves with who I actually am.”

“Is it ever difficult to pretend to be someone else?”

“Almost never.  I know who I am [REDACTED_NAME] I can give people what they want.  I have played the role of Ali for so long that it is easy to do.  It saddens me that women are held in the roles assigned to them.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] in how I was allowed to find my freedom.  Once I was in my thirties but still looked sixteen, I think my family was grateful that I found a way not to be there.  I was an oddity before I decided to be a man.”

“I suppose.”  William grinned.  “And besides, there is one more secret still unknown, by me at least.  I cannot yet guess it, but may I assume that it only added to the oddity?”

“You may assume what you wish, William.  I will not confirm it, but there is that possibility, of course.”

“Very well.  I will take you to Jerusalem, but only if you promise me not to reveal that you’re a woman.  I’m going to have enough questions to answer as it is.”

“I can do that, William.”

The Englishman took a deep breath.  “I don’t know if I love you, yet.”

Is’ad nodded as she remounted her horse.  “That is fair.  Besides, I still have a secret left.”",2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8h4fb3,1525485467,5/5/2018 1:57,confession,I had sex with a famous musician when I was 16 and I hate myself for it,"This has been on my mind for a while now. It's something that happened 10 years ago and I've kept it a secret along with my friend who also never told anyone about it but it's been making me feel depressed because I feel cheap and used the more I think on it. So yeah 10 years ago when I was 16 I went to a concert with a friend that was by a pretty big band, they were big in the 80's and still popular then so we were pretty excited to go. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to say who it was and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] really thinking of trying a lawsuit or anything I just want to talk about it and stop bottling it up inside. 

So we went to this show and it was awesome, the band were fucking amazing and we were in tears through most of the thing it was that good. This was the first proper concert I'd ever been too and the crowd and everything else was electric.  Before the show we were at the front and got talking to one of the security guys and joking around so after we saw him again and we asked him if we can go backstage and get an autograph and maybe a picture. I'd bought something in the hopes of getting it signed so we took our chances asking, can't hurt right? So he kinda smiles and says he'll go ask somebody if it's okay, he talks to this guy who it turns out is their tour manager and he looks at us for a minute and then asks us what our names are and we tell him and I say I won't bother them for long I just want my record signed etc. He thinks for a second then asks if he can take a picture of us for the tour photos and we agree posing for it. He then says he'll be  right back and will go ask the band if they are okay with visitors backstage. 

We were really excited at this point because it looked good, we spent the time talking with the security guys about all the bands they've seen play the venue and the tour manager comes back a little time later and says he'll take us backstage giving us a pass. Some others had shown up by then asking but he turned them away saying they can only accommodate us and that since we asked first he'll let us in. When we got backstage there were already women hanging around, they didn't really look like fans so we assumed maybe they are girlfriends or wives etc. The tour manager introduced us by name but nobody seemed too interested at first. After a little while they call us over and we talk to them. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] nervous and ask them to sign my record, they sign it and we talk about it and they tell us some stories about when they recorded it, we take some pictures and all seems great. 

The conversation slowly gets more personal, the bass player asks if I have a boyfriend and some questions about my sexual experience. I answer that I've not done much more than kiss a guy since I didn't really know what to do. I was scared that if I didn't answer they'd think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and kick me out or something. They seemed more talkative after that and invited us to sit next to them and made conversation. They asked if we'd come to their after party and we excitedly agreed thinking we were really cool because we were getting into a real after party with all these famous people. 

They left and we were taken in another car to their hotel and ushered into a back door and  into an elevator. The crew members took us to a room and let us in where the band guys and some others were hanging out. We hung out at first, they gave us alcohol and got us drunk, we just thought it was fun at first. They offered us pills and weed and we agreed to it all because we didn't want to say no. I started feeling lightheaded and like something bad was going to happen, I said I wanted to leave and tried to get my friend but a couple of the guys told me it'd be fine that they'd take me home when I sober up. They told me to lay down and ushered me to one of the beds. I remember really feeling out of it but I recall seeing my friend on a chair and one of the band kissing her and his hand was in her skirt. 

At that point I felt somebody touching me and he said it'd be okay because he'll be gentle. I tried to push him off but he kept pushing me down until I gave up fighting and just let him have sex with me. Everything just went silent in my mind at this point, I knew what was happening to me and I knew somewhere they were doing the same to my friend but I just went to another place. After he was done they pretty much just took it in turns to have sex with me and my friend. After a couple of times I was sitting up and felt sick, somebody gave me some medicine and said it'd make me feel better and I just took it and tried to find my clothes stumbling around. They were laughing at me and somebody asked if I need a shower which I did. There was like a door between two rooms and one guy who I guess was one of their crew or something pulled me in the other room and said to use the shower there. He was commenting on how I have a nice body and as I got in the shower I got really dizzy and blanked out, I felt somebody get in there with me and I assume it was the same guy, he did stuff to me and I lose time there, I woke up in a bed naked and the crew guy was standing around on the phone, he hangs up then he told me to shower and get dressed which I felt like I was doing before I blanked. 

After I did he was waiting for me and grabbed my arm pulling me into the corridor. He asked somebody about another girl who turned out to be my friend and they said she's in another room. He knocks on this door and an older guy in his underwear answers and inside I see she's on the bed naked. He says to get her in the shower and dressed because he's getting rid of us. We wait for a while and I can barely stand because I still feel drunk and sick, she comes out looking confused and she's crying we hug and then the crew guy still has an attitude and tells us to move pushing us to get in the same elevator we came up in. We go out a door and into a car where he asks where we live. My friend said her address because she knew her parents weren't home and her older brother was at his girlfriend's place so we wouldn't get in trouble for staying out late. 

The guy dumps us a couple of blocks away and tells us to walk which we did. It was like 3\-4am when we got back I just showered again and went to sleep. I was really angry the next day and cried but just said it was nothing when my parents asked what's wrong. I just tried to bury it and forget for years after that and so did my friend. We never even spoke about it after that day we just agreed to forget it. Some stuff triggered my memories recently and I keep having flashbacks to these guys all standing over me laughing while they hurt me. 

I guess they knew I was just another stupid teenage girl impressed with a little star power that they could manipulate and they took full advantage. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] even sure if everything that happened to me because I blanked for a long time. I don't know of anything that happened to my friend but she probably had a similar experience to me. I remember seeing older women at the hotel partying but nobody else our age. I wonder how many teenage girls this happened to, if they regularly invited some to take advantage of them and dump them after like garbage. I feel used and cheap for letting that happen to me.

2guqoq,1411127852,9/19/2014 11:57,offmychest,I was in an abusive relationship- hope my story will help someone.,"Several months after the end of my abusive relationship, I find myself craving to let it off my chest. Few people know about this, as I am [REDACTED_NAME] to sound as an ""attention whore"" to them. I finally decided that I should share my story without being ashamed about it. My main goal is not to find some pity. By sharing my story, I simply hope that someone who is in this same situation can finally find the strength to put an end to their nightmare. I know that my ex might happen to read this, but I don't really care, as I will not refer to any place or date, and I will not reveal any name. 

It all started about a year ago, when I met who I thought was a wonderful guy. We would just talk for hours, getting to know each other better, and I slowly realized at a certain point that I was in love with him. He would understand and support me, and being in a very difficult period of my life, I really appreciated that.
We got together pretty quickly, and I must admit that things started to be weird since the very beginning. I thought that maybe it was me, that I had to give him time, that maybe I just had to get to know him better. After all, he had problems as well, and I was totally willing to help him through that.

I don't really know how things started. I just know that, slowly, he started giving me some ""rules"". We would never go out, and those few times we did, he would just make me feel guilty about it afterwards. He would say that I was never happy about him, that he did anything for me (doing ""anything"" was going out once in a month for a couple of hours, just to make me happy) while I did nothing for him (while, actually, I seriously became his “slave”, and I had to do everything he asked me to). At first, I thought, well maybe he is right. At the start of our relationship, we would go out sometimes. After a month or so, I found myself feeling happy even when we simply walked to the supermarket, because that would be the only thing we did together outside of his bedroom walls. At a certain point, we even stopped doing that. He would always be mad at me, so he treated me like his slave. He would just force me to go to the supermarket every time he wanted something. Once, he let me go there three times in a day just because I did not get what he wanted.

Slowly, he also started isolating me from my friends. I must admit that it is partially my fault. I allowed him to do so. I was so in love with him at that point that I would have done anything to keep him into my life. During the first period, he made it sound as if I was the one who wanted to be there with him all the time. This happened before I realized that he was actually manipulating me, and convincing me that I was the one who was isolating herself. In reality, he just slowly convinced me that this one friend of mine wasn't good for me, and neither was this other one. I did not believe him at first, so I would keep seeing them, until he just did not allow me to see certain friends of mine anymore, ""because they have a bad influence on you, and I know what a whore you are"". At this point, I must say that I have never, ever cheated in my whole life, I never thought of cheating on him, and I would still never cheat on anyone. Yet he was so convinced that I was a whore.
He also forced me to quit smoking. And I did, because it was the only way to keep him by my side. At first I really thought that if I did not obey, he would dump me. With time I realized that he would have never broken up with me. He would simply become violent, but he would never leave me.

The first slap came this one day when I dared to say that I really felt like smoking. Bam, right on my face. I thought it was a kind of joke, or at least I convinced myself that it was. Since that slap, for about a month, he would just softly slap my face sometimes when I did something ""wrong"". 
As the time passed by, apparently I got worse and worse at being what he wanted me to be. He thought I did not put enough effort in our relationship, he thought I did it on purpose. He never realized that I was just drained. I was never enough for him. Being a good girlfriend for him meant to simply do what he asked me to do, and always say he was right. At first I could manage to do that, but at a certain point I just couldn’t find the strength anymore. 

Above all, he thought I was stupid. He really convinced me that I was not smart at all. He said that he had never met anyone smarter than himself in his own life, and I was definitely among the most stupid people he knew. He would say that my English was awful (one thing I can reveal, I am [REDACTED_NAME] a native English speaker), that my university was for dumb people like me (people, I study medicine AND psychology, and have a very good GPA by the way), and that if I had to study so hard for my final exam it must have meant that I was dumb! He never realized that I was just way too insecure, and suffering from ADHD makes me have to spend hours and hours on the books..  

Among the awful things he did to me, yesterday I was thinking about this one particular episode, which I think was one of the “nicest” things he did to me among the worst. Just to get you a feeling of how badly he treated me: My university has this kind of prom during spring. In my country we don’t have such a thing, so I was super excited to go to my first prom. I bought tickets for both me and him, and for once he accepted to go out of his bedroom walls and actually do something with me. On one condition: we had to come back at midnight, cause he had to go to school early the day afterwards. Okay, fair enough. For once, he came picking me up at my place. I was so incredibly happy, because this was such an exception. I was wearing this amazing dress, which has a big value for me (my mom wore it on a very special occasion when she was pregnant of me, and then I received it as a present from her). I tied my hair up, wore nice make-up, earrings and all. I must say, I think I am [REDACTED_NAME] a pretty girl, and that night I really looked amazing. I felt as if lately things were going worse than ever, so in a stupid attempt to make him like me I bought him 80 bucks worth of tickets to go to a festival together in May in our town. So, as soon as he showed up, with a big smile on my face, I gave him the envelop and asked him to open it. As soon as he saw the tickets, he smiled, but then he said: “haha, so you’re buying these so that you think I’m gonna stick with you until may?!”. I found it painful, but okay, whatever. I said he could go with a friend, if he didn’t want to go with me. Next thing he said was: “oh my God, look at you, you’re so ugly, with your stupid dress and your hair up!”. I just bursted into tears at that point. Damn it, I imagined my first prom to be magical, with a romantic guy who would just stare at me and be proud of showing me off, but no, he had to be rude once again. He then kind of apologized, and at the party he was super bored and annoying to me, so that night I got my consolation just by talking to a couple of guys who complimented me for looking that beautiful. They cheered me up.

At a certain point in our relationship, he started insulting my parents. He manipulated me, convinced me that without him I would be alone. No one would love me. All of my friends hated me, and my family would not be there for me. I believed him. At a certain point, I started hating him, yet I would still be together with him because I WAS SCARED. And this is why:
After the period in which he would just slap me, things started going worse and worse. Every time I contradicted him, or went on and on supporting one idea of mine, he would just hit me. He said, how can I not hit you if this is the only way I've got to let you stop?! Well, if he ever tried to listen to me, maybe he would have found a way.
The more violent he was, the more scared I got, but also the more I fought. The more he tried to convince me that he was, once again, the one who was right, ""because after all, you are stupid and you're never right"", I would just go on trying to explain to him why I might be right this time. And trust me people, I did not just merely want to win an argument. I don't care, I may be wrong sometimes, we all are. But sometimes, he would not admit the most stupid things to be right. He always had to contradict me- and convince me that I was the one contradicting him.

Anyway, I don't remember how things escalated. I just know that every time he would hit me, it was a surprise, new things were added to the horrible list of things he did to me. Spitting on me, twisting my wrists until it hurt, pulling my hair, smashing my head on the walls, smashing my entire body repeatedly against the walls, pushing me off the bed, punching my boobs, my arms, my knees (he actually ruined one of my knee tendons, and he does not even know about this.. now sometimes I can barely walk), my legs.. the list might go on. The moment I started getting really scared though was when he had these crazy moments. I mean, of course hitting me like that was already crazy, but in some moments I could see the desire to kill me in his eyes. In those moments, he would grab my neck tight in his hands, squeezing it until I could not breathe anymore.. I swear I thought I would die, many times. I am [REDACTED_NAME] very religious at all, but in those moments, desperate, I would just start praying, because I thought that my life was seriously coming to an end. Then, right before I could not breathe anymore, he would release the grip for a few seconds, let me breathe a bit and then start again.. He would do this about three times, until his raptus finished.
I have been threatened to be killed by him. He would call me horrible names, convincing me that I was a whore for real. I would not repeat the names because I think it is not appropriate, but thinking of them still hurts me deep inside. One of the last times I have been hit, it was because I could not attend his mother's birthday party because my parents were visiting me. That day was one of those in which I thought I would die. I ran away to my home country for about a month, and that has been the best period among the worst. I felt finally safe, but I was scared of coming back. In fact, for the whole month, I kept trying to break up with him, then he would call me, cry on the phone, and convince/force me to get back together. For two days or so he would be the best boyfriend ever, and I thought “well, maybe he finally changed, we can be happy again”, but then he would get mad because I did not answer for an hour, or because I went to the gym although I knew he wanted to talk to me on that specific moment of the day, so he started getting verbally violent again. Many times, he threatened me that if he would see me again when I was back, he would kill me. Sometimes, he would simply say that he would come to my place and kill me. Brace yourself.

But one day, finally, after having been hit for the first time in the street, I realized that I really had to stop this nightmare. It was not fair anymore. I had been suffering too much, some days I would just not have the courage to look at myself in the mirror, because I was ashamed of what I was doing to myself. And for what? Simply because I thought he was the best I could get. I thought ""better being hit than having no one, no one who loves me"". Then finally, I realized that he did not love me at all, and that I was better off without him.
The day I reported him, he threatened me to share my naked pictures to my family and his friends. He threatened to kill me again. At that point, I found in myself the strength to go to the police.
After that day, I have had very tough moments. I am [REDACTED_NAME] struggling with my health, both physical and psychological. But in that exact moment that I walked out of the police station doors, I felt like the most free girl in the world. That day, I realized how many people loved me. All of my friends, who I had abandoned, rushed to my place to check out on me, my parents took their first flight to take care of me (they had never known anything before my report). And then I felt so stupid, thinking for all that time that he was the only one who would be there for me, as he had tried to convince me.. 

So, whoever is reading this and can relate to my situation somehow, please know that you are strong. Do not believe one word your violent partner is telling you. Run away, before it’s too late. I know that if I did not, I might have ended up dead or seriously damaged one day. So please, just find the strength that is inside of you and break up with them. If I did it, you can do it as well. I am [REDACTED_NAME] any stronger than you, you are not any weaker than me. I believe that you can all find the strength to go all the way with it, and stop your nightmare. Because no matter how many flaws we have and how many mistakes we might have made, we do not deserve one single moment of this shit. So please, love yourself.

1gb02fj,1729768348,10/24/2024 11:12,TrueOffMyChest,"I ""woke up"" when I was 12 years old.","I woke up when I was 12.

When I was a child, strange things would happen to me. I was constantly sick with fevers and flus. I feel it's important to preface with this since it could possibly explain some of the things, but not all of them.

 I had a small tube TV in the room next to my bedroom, I called it the toy room because I had an easel, desk, casette deck et cetera in there. I repeatedly woke up sitting in a chair in front of my TV, not remembering walking there. It lasted for about a year when I was 5-6.

 When I was about 7 years old I remember standing up out of bed and suddenly being in the middle of a field near my house in my underwear in a heavy rain storm. I walked home since it was only a block away and all the doors of my house were locked, I had to knock to be let in. I remember my parents' shock and disbelief. They always denied it happened and seemed to have no memory of it after that night, but when my mom passed in 2019 I read her old journals she left to me and she wrote it down in 2003! They just genuinely didn't seem to remember it even the next day, even til the day she died. My dad still claims not to remember!

Around this time I started having terrible dreams, waking up groaning and crying, unable to remember them. I genuinely felt like there was something coming into my room and putting the dreams into my head. They stopped abruptly one day and I haven't had a single dream since then. 

Between the ages of 8-10 I would frequently have out-of-body experiences where I would see myself from different viewpoints. Sometimes it was like an over-the-shoulder 3rd person perspective, other times it would be a view from above. It was genuinely all I could see, I couldn't see out of my eyes but only through this odd perspective. I thought I would be seen as crazy if I tried to tell anyone so I just kept quiet and tried not to think about it. It happened occasionally as I got older but 

From 10-12, I have no memories. None. My parents claimed I just kind of stopped talking, stopped interacting with people, stopped doing anything at all. They said I was like a ghost just existing and emotionless, robotic and silent unless asked a question. I failed all of my classes and was nearly put into special Ed.

Then one day when I was about 12 I just.. woke up. No more weird sicknesses, no more sleepwalking (or teleporting I guess?), no more weird dissociating, nightmares, robotic behavior, paranormal experiences, nothing. I started remembering things normally, experiencing normal pre-teen feelings, everything just kind of started being ""okay"".

I don't even know why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this but it just crossed my mind and felt weird. Any explanations or insights, even just comments or shared experiences would be awesome. Thanks for reading.

1f3ay50,1724853633,8/28/2024 14:00,offmychest,I(21M) was held hostage in my own home by my older sister and her boyfriend(28F) and my mom didn't protect me.,"I have always thought I'd moved past my sister's influence on me. We'd always had a complicated relationship with each other. She'd try to teach me good habits but they just had a hard time sticking with me. Not because I don't want to, I just keep forgetting them. We'd constantly get into arguments with each other and it's deeply affected me growing up so I never had the confidence in myself until she moved out. At times it feels like she loves me but other times it feels like she's abusive towards me. She claimed to have changed her behavior but recently I found out that wasn't completely the case. My mom got stuck somewhere on a business trip without telling me she left in the first place. I couldn't reach her and got worried. Snow storm knocked out our power at the on the same day, I really didn't want to call her but I didn't know what else to do. My sisters and niece were too much for me to handle without her help. At first she was helping us out, I was going to tidy up that day but the Storm knocked out the power the same day. She hates messes as most people would and I tried to make it a habit to keep it tidy. But it wasn't easy for me to do, I was going through some mental problems, and was very depressed about something else I can't remember right now. But she was upset about the mess and that our mom left without saying anything. And so was I. She was helping us genuinely, she even brought us dinner so I decided to not cause any conflicts with her since she dropped everything to help us. After the power came back on the next day she decided to take my first sister and niece to grab my mom my brother and I could stay home. On our own I'm 21 by the way 20 at the time because my birthday just passed. Anyway, but this is where it goes south, she decided to take us to Maryland and leave us their while she gets my mother back home. I didn't want to go but she refused to listen to me. I don't mind a road trip but it was unnecessary for the situation we were in and I couldn't tell her that because she'd get mad at me and get personal with me. The road trip itself wasn't that bad going there but she brought mom there after a day only to take us home immediately after. After that I decided to stand up for myself because she was being rude and nasty refusing to let us go to bed after we got home even though it was the middle of the night. As soon as I told her I couldn't take it anymore she mocked me via text treating me like an ignorant child. It was like as soon as I stopped doing everything she said, I lost the write to be treated like a human being. Then I said she has nothing on me then she said she had everything on me and I'd see real SOON fully capitalized in the text message. My mom told me she was coming back and I calmed down after a while but had trouble sleeping that night. She hoped I'd put up with her a little longer since she was upset, she never really stopped my sister from acting out and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] realizing after the fact she was enabling her bad behavior. The following day is when things went south. I thought she'd leave us alone now that my mom was home, and she would be too upset to deal with me. The following day I was about to go to the store for my mom, but my older sister and her boyfriend showed up right when I was about to leave. I really didn't want to talk with her because my gut was telling me it wasn't going to end well. And I was right, I tried to walk out the door but both of them blocked the door preventing me from leaving. I was so scared she'd torment and intimate me because I refused to listen to her the day before, I tried to hide in my room, but she demanded me to listen to her for once and her boyfriend told me not to run away and my mother forced me to talk with her. But this 'talk' was nothing but her tormenting me for a while. Yelled about how I was not going to be able to take care of myself if I move out and how if I didn't step up and act like a responsible adult, I'll end up being taken away from my mother and put into a potentially abusive foster home and kept saying that'd I'd get into big trouble if I moved into college dorms. And I tried calling her out for standing in front of the door and blocking it with her entire body as if she was holding me hostage and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] now realizing that she was. Again, my mom was doing nothing to stop her, I felt so scared and threatened to the point I couldn't even leave my own house. She said she was blocking the door because every time she tried to force me into a conversation with her, I leave the house to avoid her, and she hated it and asked me how she was childish because after getting all up in my face. I felt like dodging the question but she wasn't giving me a choice so I tried to move her out the way so I could just get the hell out of there, but my mom and younger sister restrained me as if I was going to attack her and she was livid and told me I could just go to jail for what I just did so I decided to call the police on myself which my mom didn't allow and she talked about the time when I was sixteen and she physically attacked me but spun it around to make me seem like the aggressor and she laments how she got in trouble with the authorities. She mocked me for over an hour and mom did nothing to defend me and the only thing she said was that she wanted it to end and my older sister said she was going to start doing visits and if nothing changed this 'conversation' would happen again and she looked at me with the most hateful look she's ever given me and said ""The truth hurts and if you put your hands on me again you're not going to end up in a happy place"" and slam the door and left. Then my mom just gave me back my phone and told me to calm down. I was so stressed out and traumatized I couldn't eat sleep, and I didn't feel like myself anymore and I had to ask my mom to hug me and broke down in tears, usually I don't cry in tough situations, but this practically broke me. I spent weeks having nightmares wanting to kill myself thinking I'm a dangerous person who will attack anyone at the drop of a hat. I spent weeks figuring out what to do and my mom told me everyone was in the wrong only making me feel more insane. I eventually moved out after my summer job was finished and am currently staying with my dad who can't believe I went through something so horrible, sorry if my story seems a little all over the place but only now. Do I realize how messed up this all was, do you think my mother and sister are toxic and do you think I should stay away from them I cut contact with my sister, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I might run into again.Even before this incident my older sister always put me down for things she didn't agree with me on. I was only 14 years old trying to enjoy my day before she made fun of me for enjoying Pokemon and telling jokes and how I wouldn't make any friends and this would continue for years to come. She would act nice sometimes but other times she would be nasty rude and condescending to me whenever I wasn't doing anything she wanted me to do even if I was technically not doing anything against the house rules. She never even apologized for what she did to me and she told me that I shouldn't set boundaries with her and people wouldn't wait for me to be ready to talk and I felt like it was a red flag. She even told me happy birthday pretending she never did what she did and after that I felt sick to my stomach for the rest of the day and had a nightmare that night. Not sure how my mom could possibly think I would want to speak with her after she did that to me and how she couldn't realize that I didn't want to speak with her. I took me months to find myself again and during my time at karate I made friends and when I told them about what happened they made me feel safe with them and I started to realize how much I was shaped to be dependent on her and my mother never gaining the independence I needed to avoid a situation like that so I used my summer youth job to save enough money to get out of New York and I moved in with my dad who I wasn't living with since my parents split up. We don't see each other often because he lived in Maryland and we moved to New York when I was seven and I think she had custody of us. But since I was old enough to leave I decided that I had enough and left. It was sad that I had to leave the city for the sake of my mental health but ever since I got here I never felt more sane. I told my dad what happened and he couldn't believe that I was put into a situation where she held me hostage and verbally abused me with everyone just enabling her. But despite that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] healing from what I've been through and I thought typing it out would help me let go and let it out. Still I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I might run into her one day and get into another situation like that, but I feel safer and the nightmares are happening a lot less now. Dad said my older sister used to be a kind and caring person and can't fathom her turning into what she had become. He hopes things will work out between us but he respects my decision to stay away from her and that felt very validating and I feel less insane than I did when I went to my mom who saw the whole thing going down. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a better place now and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] changes to my life so I can be more independent and take care of myself and now understand what is and isn't healthy behavior in family relationships.

1ah075h,1706867822,2/2/2024 9:57,offmychest,Me and my straight best friend fell in love and were in a secret 'relationship' for years.,"Hi guys, this is my story about how me and my straight best friend fell in love, and how I'm [REDACTED_NAME] struggling with it right now. I can’t really find anything on reddit with the same bizarre situation I found myself in. This all occurred between 2[REDACTED_PHONE]. This is a long story, so strap in.For some context - I'm a (closeted) bi 26 male, my friend is a straight 28 male. Both of us are middle eastern men and have traditional middle eastern families where it is expected to get married to a woman (will become relevant). We are stereotypical middle eastern men, both around 6-foot, beard, muscles.  
  
I met my friend, James, in the gym in August of 2016. I was 19, he was 21. We would train every day at the exact same times and would notice each other but not talk at all, just the occasional 'bro nod' if we made eye contact. I thought he was handsome, he was buff and had a cute smile, but no intention to get romantic or intimate with him. There was always some weird tension in the air that each one of us wanted to talk to one another, but no one made the first move. Then one day at the gym while I was training legs, I noticed him doing deadlifts. The deadlift platforms are right next to the squat racks, so we were just a few metres away from each other. He was struggling to remove the weights from the bar, so I went and offered some help. From that moment we started talking and just instantly clicked. We set up some training days, which would then lead into us going to get post workout meals and going out together and eventually becoming best friends pretty fast. And that's all it was at first - two bros that met in the gym and became best friends.James was a cool, fun, caring, considerate, innocent guy. He didn't have any friends really. He left school at 15 or 16, fell out of contact with his school friends and just would spend his time in the gym or gaming. His family situation at home was not what you'd call ordinary, but I wouldn't t want to share those details. I learned that he was quite the trouble maker in his late teens - getting into fights, getting arrested etc. James was a hot head and that never changed throughout the years. After his teens, he started the gym and just focusing on bettering himself. It's something that I really admired of him. As a result of him working on himself, he didn't socialize with people much, didn't go out at all, heck, he didn't even know there was such things as different types of coffees! (cappuccino, latte's etc.) Regardless, he had a heart of gold. He would randomly message me ""Good morning bro, have a great day"" or message me throughout the day hoping my day is going well. It was great having a friend like him.As time went on, we grew closer, we practically spent every day together, whether it be at the gym, or at each other’s houses, family BBQ's, beaches, restaurants, partying - you name it. We became inseparable, honestly felt like a brother. We would talk for hours about our what we wanted in the future, our love for cars, gaming, foods etc. A couple months after first talking, it was his birthday. I love getting presents for my friends, so I surprised him with a gaming headset and a tub of creatine. His reaction was priceless, seeing him so happy was just great. It’s important to note, up until now, all feelings were just brotherly love, there were no romantic feelings.  
  
In December of 2016, I met a guy that I would eventually date. This was my first boyfriend, so it was quite exciting, having had many girlfriends before it just felt like a different thrill. We dated for about 6 months, but in this time, me and James drifted a little. I couldn't find the time to catch up as much, and I was now training with my boyfriend instead. James thought my boyfriend was just another friend, and I'd still see James at the gym regularly and speak to him quite often, but it wasn't the same as before. Eventually me and my boyfriend broke up in May of 2017. Me and James started hanging out more after this.I was struggling after the break up with my boyfriend (he cheated on me), and being closeted, had no one I could talk to. I felt James knew something was up, but never really questioned anything. Eventually, I felt like I just needed to tell someone, and James was the only person I felt like I could trust. I picked him up to go for a drive (we usually would just enjoy going for drives, listening to music and just talking). We parked at a lookout spot that we would usually chill at, and we started talking then I just started crying. I told him I needed to tell him something, and that I hope he didn't see me any different or feel any different about me (this was my biggest fear, being abandoned for something I had no control over i.e. my sexuality). He just kept telling me to tell him, that its fine that he's not going to judge. So I eventually told him that my ""friend"" that he saw me training with at the gym, wasn't just a friend, he was more than that. His response, which I will never forget, was ""so he was your best friend?"". This made me burst out laughing because he wasn't trying to be funny, he genuinely couldn't pick up on what I was trying to insinuate. I told him no, he was my boyfriend, and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. He just looked at me and told met that's fine, and that it doesn't change how he thinks of me or anything. He hugged me and told me it’s going to be ok.  
  
Me and James started training together again, would spend each weekend together, and basically did everything together, again. This time, it felt as if we were much closer. I could feel myself getting feelings for him, both emotionally and sexually. Since coming out to him, he made me feel safe and accepted. I now found him really attractive, and at times he'd catch me staring at him or giving him shy looks. I sometimes got the vibe that maybe he liked me back, but I would always try to downplay the feelings because I genuinely didn't want to ruin our friendship. Plus, he was completely straight, and I knew there was no chance he would go for anything - or so I thought.James had gotten his arm sleeve tattooed - and being a fresh tattoo, his arms were much more sensitive. He would randomly tell me to run my fingers along his arms because it felt really good - which I used to love doing, and to be honest, just made me want him really bad. However one night, James was staying the night (he usually would stay over on the odd weekend). My family was out of town on vacation, and it was just me and James. He was laying down on my bed and we were just talking, then he asked me to run my fingers along his arm. I was sweating after a couple of minutes. Eventually, I started running my finger up his arm, along his shoulder and down his body. He didn't say anything or move, he just had his eyes closed. One thing led to another, and I ended up pulling his pants off and giving him a blowjob. He had his eyes closed and would randomly say that the cant believe this is happening and that he's not into guys but he doesn't know what's going on. We spent all night kissing and fooling around. The next day, things were normal between us, we talked about what happened, about how he's not gay but he enjoyed it, and it became sort of frequent. At this stage, our relationship was more sexual rather than emotional (albeit there was still strong emotion there) - we were both still talking to other people. I would see the odd guy for a hookup, but it just felt off, so I stopped seeing or talking to people all together. James also expressed that it did hurt him that I was seeing other guys. James continued to speak to and see other girls, which did hurt me a lot, but I wasn't ever in a position to tell him he had to stop. I knew he was a straight guy that had urges, which didn't make it any easier to deal with. Every time James would go out and see a girl, he would tell me how wrong it felt and that he didn't want to hurt me. Honestly, it broke me more and more each time. This is what began the cycle of the most intense, profound happiness, and the most heartbreaking of pain.  
  
So fast forward a few months (late 2017), the feelings became more emotional and intense. Even though he was still randomly seeing women (once every few months), I couldn't stop loving him. I didn't know how to stop. We would hold hands when no one was looking, kiss secretly, we stopped talking to other people. We basically were in an unofficial relationship. It felt amazing but in the back of my mind, I felt like crap. I saw that James had days where he struggled, he questioned if he was gay or bi, he would try to explore (gay porn, looking at other guys) but he couldn't figure out why he felt the way he did for me, and I could see it really bothered him. Eventually we came across pansexuality, and once he learned about it, he thought that he may be Pan. This brought him some closure, but it never felt like it would last forever.You could say we 'unofficially' dated after late 2017. We both didn't talk to others for a few months, and it was just us two together. We would go on dates, mini vacations and get aways, sleep at each other’s houses (our families still thought we were just friends), still trained together, and honestly life in those months felt perfect. He felt like he was the perfect guy for me. We told each other we loved each other frequently and would talk about how we want to spend the rest of our life with each other. I thought I was in love in my previous relationships, but this was far and above any of those. The feelings were so intense both ways. I was always the more dominant one in all my previous relationships, but with James, he made me feel safe, that he could take care of me, he would give me butterflies just by seeing him. I was madly in love with him and he too with me. It was almost perfect, but we both struggled. We both knew deep down that this would never really work out.  
  
There was always the pressure from family, especially for me, to get married to a woman and have kids. I struggled because I felt like I had to try and pursue someone, just to keep my family happy and remove any suspicion of me being gay/bi (sounds stupid, I know). Eventually mid 2018 an old female friend from school came into my life again, and she had told me how she always had feelings for me. I tried for a month or so to talk to her (James knew), but it never worked out. I was talking to her, whilst being in love with James, it was beyond selfish on my part, and it was just a disaster waiting to happen and well that disaster did happen, on my 21st birthday.On my 21st birthday, mid 2018, I hired a hotel room, and my female friend came. I had a ton of other friends there, along with James. I guess to put up the charade of me being straight to the rest of my friends, I was kissing and around my female friend all night. The female friend slept in the same bed as me, and we ended up having sex. While we were doing it, James walked in and yeh... it ended up really messy. It was probably my biggest regret I've had until this day. I knew I shouldn't. In that moment I was scared if she would suspect I was Bi or gay and out me to my friends, especially since she would already question mine and James' relationship. Eventually after a couple of weeks, I told my female friend it’s not going to work out, and just focused on fixing things with James. I had really hurt him and honestly felt like absolute crap. I knew he loved me, and I still chose to sleep with her, and then for him to walk in and see that, it just makes me sick knowing I caused him that pain. This female would also be the last person I would see intimately until January of 2024. We eventually moved past this, and things more or less went back to how they were, where me and James were just doing life together.For the next couple of years (2[REDACTED_PHONE]), things were mostly good. We would be okay for months on end, where we both acted oblivious to the future and knowing we would probably never work out, but we were both in love and enjoying life, enjoying the moment. Then James would go through the same struggles with our situation where he began questioning himself again, he didn't feel 'normal' (his words), and in turn, would go out and see other girls. We were both not in positions to come out or let anyone know about us. Eventually there was a night that we argued, and he stopped answering all calls and texts. Turns out he went and had met up with a woman and slept with her. This broke me, much harder than previous times. We didn't talk for a few days, but as the toxic cycle goes, he contacted me after a couple of days, and I caved. I still loved and cared for him dearly.When we did begin talking after a few days, he kept saying he's sorry, that he was just craving a woman's body, that his head is all messed up and he's struggling because he's in love with me, a man, but is straight. I really understood his struggles, and I know how much he was giving up for me (a straight, attractive 24-25 year old, choosing to spend his time with me instead of women). I loved him so much; I knew that this was a big struggle for him. I tried to end things multiple times just so it stops playing with his head so much, but every time one of us would go back to the other. In hindsight, I don't know why each of us kept going back, especially since we both knew it would never work between us. All we would both ever say is that we wish things were different (i.e. different family situations, I was a female etc.).From mid-2018, I hadn't seen anyone else, and James continued to see women once every 3-6 months, the last being mid-2021. We would constantly fight about this, but not being in an actual relationship, it just felt impossible to tell not to. He begged to have a threesome when he had urges to see a woman, and at first I wanted to, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt as if it would hurt too much to see him with a woman. I never told him he couldn't see other woman, but he made it very clear that if I saw another man and had sex with another man, that would be the end of us. James was ok if I were to occasionally see women, but to see another man was completely off limits. Sounds ridiculous, I know.This cycle continued for the following years (2[REDACTED_PHONE]). It was disgustingly toxic and yet, when blocking out all the trauma, was the most amazing time together. We both knew this would never work, we both knew neither could stop each other from moving on to other people, yet neither one of us wanted to end things. Me and James were in love. We became part of each other’s families, we went to each other’s family weddings, family events, went on vacations. We made love, we spoke about our fantasy future with one another, we spoke about how we want to grow old together. We went and bought one of his dream cars together, we helped each other start our own businesses, he made me feel safe, cared about, valued, like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only man in this world. He made me feel what true love feels like. He would wish me a good morning or good night every day, just as he did when we first met as friends. He would tell me he loved me every day, and I too him. I wanted to give him the world. We spoke every single day; we told each other we loved each other every day and every day we wished things were different.  
  
In May of 2022, everything would change. We had planned to spend a Friday night at my place, with some pizza and watch movies/sport. When James was picking up the pizza in his aforementioned dream car, he popped a tyre. He came to mine; my dad woke up from his sleep and fixed it. However, you can imagine, a grumpy middle eastern dad just woken up from his sleep, and a hot headed 26-year-old does not make for a good mix. After my dad fixed the tyre and went inside, I told him that he needed to relax and show some respect, which made James flip out. he left the pizza, got in the car and drove off. We didn't speak until that Monday. I called him on the Monday, and he seemed off. He was saying things like we really shouldn't speak anymore and to just forget about him. I kept pressing and asked if he had slept with anyone. He said he did, which of course then had that usual feel of heart break that I was slowly becoming numb to, but then he still seemed really off. I kept pressing and asked who. He didn't want to tell me, he kept putting it off, kept telling me to hang up and forget about him. I felt myself getting sick, and I begged him to please tell me. He then said, ""your aunty"". My heart sank. I fell silent and started quivering. I asked ""what? what did you say?"". He started apologizing and repeated ""your aunty"". I then started screaming, asking which aunt and what he was talking about. He then said her name. This was my aunty who was only a few years older than me and was basically an older sister to me. I burst out into tears and hung up. I was hyperventilating and felt like the walls were caving in. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't go outside of my room as my entire family were home, I couldn't make noise, I couldn't scream, shout, punch anything. It felt as if time had stopped and I couldn't hear, smell, taste or see anything. All I could feel is my throat clogging up and my eyes not being able to produce tears fast enough. I felt like I was in a corner, I ended up finding the phone number of an old guy I had met online, we hadn't spoken for over 5 years, and just called him and told him what was going on. Poor guy probably in a state of shock, but I seriously didn't know how to react to that. My best friend/lover sleeping with my aunt who is like an older sister to me. I became an absolute wreck. I immediately deleted James off social media and blocked his number and ended up leaving the house and driving to mine and James look out spot where I had come out to him, and stayed there all night. I cried myself to sleep in the car. I had never felt that type of pain before.  
  
Some more context - growing up in a middle eastern family, we are very close with one another. I would see my grandparents about 3 times a week and said aunt every 2nd day. Family is everything in our culture and something like this is just completely foreign to me. It hurt especially more because James was literally part of our family, even before things got intimate/romantic. There wouldn't be a family event run where my family didn't invite him. So this betrayal both felt like a betrayal of me and my family. It was also a betrayal from my aunt. It takes two to tango, so I knew that a lot of the blame fell on her also for going through with that situation. (Again, it might be ok for some people to have their friends hook up with their relatives, but in our culture and from what I have grown up with, it was completely foreign and absurd.)  
  
I ended up going no contact with James for the weeks that followed. My aunt also found out that I knew and initially apologized which quickly turned into a threat, saying that if anyone else found out in our family, I'd ""have to be the one to explain to her son why he's growing up without a mother"". To put it plainly, I was a complete wreck. I didn't know how to deal with the situation, I didn't know how to process it, I tried to block out emotions, deal with emotions, meditate, do something that was interesting, but it felt like nothing was working. I couldn't focus for the next 2 weeks at all, would find myself crying while driving. I couldn't eat at all, didn't respond to any of my other friends, didn't see family, couldn't train at the gym, nothing was enjoyable. It really was a dark and miserable time, and honestly, I don't know how I got through it. What was crazy though, was that I remember thinking that maybe it was my fault. Maybe that because he was in this situation with me, and that he felt so bad seeing women that he forced himself not to, that I drove him to the point of doing something like this. He hadn't seen a woman for about a year before this incident, so I feel like if I had maybe encouraged him to go and satisfy his urges, he wouldn't have slept with my aunt? (Side note - Wow, writing this now, and reflecting, it really shows how little I valued myself. I was willing to go through that pain of him sleeping with a woman, just so I can continue loving him and feeling loved?)  
  
James' sister contacted me within those 2 weeks, asking what's going on. James' sister was the one of the only people I liked in his family, she really cared and looked after James, and made me feel accepted into their family. She said she noticed James seemed off, and when she asked him, he just said that him and I had a fight and that he, (James), fucked up. I told her what happened, and she just said have your space and how messed up that situation is. We spoke for about 20 minutes, before hanging up. It was really hard to forget about James. My family would constantly ask about him, my grandparents would demand he come over, my siblings all missed him. It just sucked. Everything and everyone reminded me of him. It was just a really difficult time These two weeks were the longest I hadn't seen or spoken to him for about 5 years.After about 5 weeks in July of 2022, James started trying to contact me begging to see me. He called me off private numbers and his sister’s number. There was a weekend he tried to call over 100 times. In the end, being the weak miserable person I was at the time, I answered. He wanted to meet in person to talk and be able to say goodbye properly. He kept telling me how sorry he was, and how he didn't know what happened that night, he just asked my aunt to go for a drive and then they ended up meeting up in our lookout spot (yes, where I came out to him and where I cried all night!) and one thing led to another, and they had sex. He kept telling me it’s the biggest mistake of his life and that he loves me and he's sorry. Part of me just wanted to hug him (pathetic, I know), but in the end I just told him what a pig I thought he was and to just leave me alone. It’s weird, because at the time I seriously blamed both of them, but there was still a part of me that blamed myself for causing this entire situation. In hindsight, I remember my aunt being very touchy feely with him at family events, and James would always try and stay away from her (I always thought that's just because James is a sort of introvert and my aunt is very extrovert, so he wanted to get away from her).James in that same week came to my home. It was night time and he knocked on the door and refused to leave, begging to talk. I didn't want to make a scene at home, so I just put on some shoes and went with him. He spoke about how sorry he was, and asked how I was doing and basic small talk. I didn't really respond to him, just asking what the fuck he wanted and that I just want to be left alone. He kept apologizing, saying he doesn't know how to stay away and that he just gets nights like these where he tries his hardest not to contact me but can’t help it. I honestly can’t remember that night well, I just remember going to park somewhere and we just spoke, and he just wanted this opportunity to say goodbye properly. After a couple of hours, he dropped my off at home and that was that, or so I thought.  
  
I went no contact for a few months, until about November of 2022. I had started going to the gym with my friend, X. One day when driving him home from the gym, we were at a traffic light and James pulls up next to me in his car. He looks inside and then starts going crazy in the car. He pulls down his window and is screaming and making hand gestures for me to wind the window down. I just drive off and he proceeds to follow me. The drive back to my friend’s home is about 10 minutes, he follows me for about 6 minutes, the entire time speeding up and racing past me, then slowing down and waiting for me to catch up to him. We end up at another traffic light and my friend is now freaking out. James proceeds to scream and tells me to wind my window down, which I do now. He starts asking ""who's that?"" and ""are you already seeing another guy"". I then tell him to calm the fuck down, it’s just X. (James knows X, he just couldn't recognize him because it was night time and windows are tinted). He then clearly breathes a sigh of relief and then begs if we can just talk. I didn't want to freak my friend out anymore, so I told him to wait in the side street and I would come back. I dropped my poor friend off and ended up returning to the side street to speak to James.I got into his car and immediately I looked at him and he looked really bad. He looked like he hadn't been sleeping much, he had lost weight, he didn't have a clean haircut (we would go cut our hair together every week). I just asked him how he was, and he broke down crying. I couldn't help it and hugged him. He kept apologizing and saying it’s the biggest mistake of his life and because of his fuck up he had lost me. It’s one of the very few times I saw James cry. As fucked up as it sounds, I felt heartbreak for him. I gave him another hug and all I could smell was him. His smell. It drove me insane. I had missed him so much and just for a few minutes, time stood still and it felt like nothing mattered again. We ended up talking for a few minutes, and then out of no where we locked eyes and ended up kissing. In the moment I didn't realize how wrong this was, but I don't think I really ever accepted that I wanted to lose him? That kiss felt like the kiss we had on the first night, its really hard to put into words the feelings that were going on. I ended up suggesting to get a hotel room, which he went and booked and we ended up spending the night together. We kissed, made love, cuddled. It felt like nothing else mattered in that moment. It was the wrong thing to do, and should have never happened, but I wasn't strong enough to stop it. I don't know if I regret this, but I know it wasn't the right thing to do. I woke up the next morning and we went our separate ways. I remember feeling like trash while driving home, like what the hell did I just do? But then there was a part of me that enjoyed it, enjoyed him, enjoyed feeling cared for and safe in his arms. It was just a really confusing time.This I guess then led into us trying to talk again (Again, I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for this). Up until this moment, I had just been dealing with it alone, hadn't spoken to anyone, bar that guy I called the night I found out about the situation with James and my aunt. It was a really lonely time and maybe I should have seen a therapist, but I never really understood how that works or if it works at all. So I guess I just allowed James back into my life, and we became really close again. We weren't doing much intimate stuff together, but he was really trying with me. He would constantly tell me he loves me, he was being really affectionate and was trying hard, but for me, it just never really felt the same. I still loved him so much, and still struggled to imagine him with someone else or me without him, but it just didn't feel the same.From late 2022 until late 2023, we tried to make it work. He never came to my home or any family events after the incident in May of 2022, I went to his home a few times but felt like I shouldn't be there, especially with his sister knowing what happened. I ended up telling my friend, X, about the incident with my aunt. I didn't tell him the full story with James and I. It felt as if it was wrong for other people to see us talking again, even though to 99% of people, they just knew us as best friends/brothers. I felt pressure to try and keep me and James talking a secret. It was just a difficult period. Things just weren't the same, we knew the trauma was too much, but no one wanted to end things for good. I did eventually tell him I love him again. I did really love him, I don't think I ever stopped, but it just felt different. Even when he told me he loved me, it felt different. We tried to make it work but it never really clicked again.  
  
In 2023, I had booked a trip to travel overseas into from late 2023 into January of 2024. It had been my dream to travel, since my last trip in 2019 I had cut 2 weeks short for James (a completely separate side story). This trip would be with me and X. James hated the idea of me travelling, just because he was afraid I would meet another guy (his words, not mine). However I just didn't care anymore and booked the trip. About 2 months before the trip, me and James had a big fight. As like most others, it was because he was sick of feeling like he was not able to be with women. He kept saying that he is a straight guy and he feels bad to even talk to a woman, and he hates that. He kept saying he doesn't blame me, its himself, but he cant help it. In the end, I just told him to go do whatever made him happy, which I have always done, and to just leave me alone and just to go our separate ways. It was a longer conversation with that but I honestly cant remember the details, I just know I was so over the fighting.So for the first time, he did leave me alone, he didn't contact me for those months. We'd see each other at the gym every night (same gym as we first met in, poetic hey?), and just act like strangers. We constantly made eye contact, but we both knew we couldn't go back to one another. It felt really sad, but honestly I don't think I had accepted those feelings yet. He messaged me a couple days before I was meant to leave, wishing me a great trip and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] getting to fulfil one of my dreams of travelling. I honestly wanted to hug him after this but instead just replied ""Thanks"".I went on said trip, I was travelling throughout Europe for 2 months. I met a few guys, but I couldn't bring myself to do anything intimate with them. I finally understood what James meant when he said that it felt wrong to talk to someone else, even though you are attracted to them. It felt like I was betraying James. My loyalty for him was so embedded into my existence that I forgot how to interact with other people in an intimate/romantic setting. Overall, the trip was amazing and I had a great time, I just figured out pretty early on in the trip that I don't want to be meeting anyone, I don't think I was ready yet. (Side note - I was posting stories on my Instagram throughout my trip, and James would view every single one, even though we don't follow each other, so he was still actively checking my account)  
  
Fast forward to now, January of 2024. I arrived home a few weeks ago, and after a few days went to see my barber. This barber was one both me and James went to every single week (I introduced James to him). James would usually go on Wednesdays, so I made sure to go on Thursday to avoid him. However, as chance would have it, after sitting on the barber chair for about 5 minutes, I see James' vehicle pull into the parking lot. I instantly feel nervous, I felt heavy in my seat, and started sweating. Not sure what made me feel this way, but I couldn't help it. He walks in and is stunned, because just a few days ago I had posted a photo on my Instagram story of me in London, and I know he had seen it. He walks up to me in the barber chair, and shakes my hand and welcomes me back. He asked how my trip was, I respond ""great"", and then he went and took a seat on the couch. Throughout the entire haircut, we would catch each other staring at one another through the mirror.That week that followed, I couldn't really get him out of my head. I really wanted to see him and talk to him. I really missed him. So come the following Thursday, I was working and planning to get a haircut that day. I stopped by home to spray some cologne, and went to the barber shop. James wasn't there, but if he were to come it would be around 4-5pm, as he finished work around 3 to 3.30pm. So I sat, and after about 30 minutes, James walks in, only this time he doesn't say hi to me. He just goes and sits down on the couch. We made eye contact a few times, before I said to myself screw it, and messaged him ""stop looking so angry"" (James had a resting b\*\*\*\* face lol). He immediately burst into laughter lol, and couldn't contain his smile. I then signalled to him to come sit near me, so he did.  
  
We started talking, him asking about my trip, me asking how he has been, and we both knew we wanted to ask each other if we had met someone. He then looked at me and told me ""I know you want to ask something"" so I just did. I asked if he ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ad a girlfriend now (in a joking way), I was really expecting him to say no, especially since our last argument, he made it clear he doesn't want a relationship or anything, however, he just looked at me and said yeh. He saw my heart drop through my eyes. I thought even if he said yes, I was prepared for it, but realizing he is dating a woman now, it really stunned me. He saw this, and told me to come outside so we can continue talking. He told me how he met this girl as a hookup, and she's my age, and tried to push her away multiple times. He mentioned how she just kept pushing to spend time with him, and then they just clicked when he gave her a chance. The entire time he was explaining this, I kept looking enthusiastic but he knew deep down I was breaking. He apologized and said that it just happened, that he couldn't control how he felt for her and that they got into a relationship only a few weeks prior. She's already met his family," and he said he really loves her. I just kept telling him """"good for you"""" and told him in happy for him. I told him that I met a guy", and I lied to him saying we slept together, just to hurt him. He looked at me and told me he wish I didn't," and that how could I etc. I just looked at him like """"what the hell"," really?"""" Like his got a girlfriend now", and he's telling me off for sleeping with a guy? Regardless, it didn't really help the pain I started to feel. It only really hit me once I finished my haircut and left the barber. I got into the car and immediately burst out into tears. I hadn't dealt with the feelings I think of actually losing James, and now that he was dating someone, it was really over. I don't know what stupid fantasy world I was living in, maybe thinking there's a chance? I got home and was a wreck all night, just looking through old photos, videos, texts and crying.I messaged him the next day and told him the truth, that I never slept with any guys and only said that to hurt him. (An important note - me and James were always truthful to each other, we never ever hid anything from each other, no matter how messed up or humiliating it might have been, so its just important that I told him the truth.) He then called me and we then spoke for a couple hours on the phone, and I told him that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] struggling, he just kept apologizing, saying what we had was amazing, and to be strong and put myself out there. I told him I don't know how I can, I cant just get up and love someone else after a few months? I told him that I hadn't moved on from him, that every night I still think of him, everything still reminds me of him, it was just hard and it really sucked. He told me how he's always battling with his mental state, as to how he slept with a man even though he is straight. He says it gets hard for him but he deals with it. He told me he still loves me, and there will always be a part of him that loves me. He kept telling me that he's always here, no matter what, and he really wants to be friends. He wants to be friends, hang out just like we did when we first met, and as much as I wish it could happen, I just told him, for now, no, I just need space. We then spoke about old times, old memories, how things evolved from best friends to lovers. We cried a little. He told me that for him to love another man, its a special type of love because he's a straight guy. He said he will never ever experience what we had with someone else, but we both knew it would never work out. Which we did, we both knew it wouldn't work.What became really apparent over the years, was how shitty I felt for doing this to my best friend, whilst also feeling betrayed by him for all the times he would go see other people, even though I know he couldn't help it. I cant help but blame myself for not being able to control myself that night where we first became intimate, or backing off when I knew I was getting feelings for him. Writing this is the first time I've been able to let it out completely to anyone or anything. I've had to stop and cry multiple times.

So now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a stage of not being sure on how to move on, the situation was doomed from the start but alas we are here now. Upon writing this and reflecting, I notice how much I've changed, and how much I lost myself throughout this entire experience. I was always the type of guy that could get through anything alone, I always saw myself as someone who is strong willed, can tough through life's challenges and come out on top every time, however I guess I was wrong, and here I am, not sure where to go from here, what to do, how to move on, how to love someone else or how to find contentment again. Because that's the thing, I haven't felt genuine contentment like I had when I was in James' presence. Happiness, yes, but contentment, no. It is only now that I realize it’s really over, and only now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to see how fucked I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I feel broken. I not only lost my soul mate, but my best friend. Before all of this we were just friends, and at times I wish it were still that way, but then I think about all the good times and reminisce.In the end, we loved each other, no matter how fucked up the situation was, or how badly we hurt each other. It's crazy how someone can break your heart, and yet you still find a way to love them with all the small pieces.I know that life is long, and it’s not the be all and end all, but I just don't know where to go from here.If you made it this far, thanks everyone for reading. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, and the way it’s written is probably rubbish, but it’s the first time I've ever done something like this, and I really just needed an avenue to let everything out. I couldn't possibly fit everything in here, it would turn into a twilight series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1eve9z3,1724000783,8/18/2024 17:06,stories, I shit my pants during job interview last week,"It sounds unbelievable, but that’s exactly what happened. Just before the interview, I felt an urgent need to use the bathroom but hoped I could hold it for the 10 minutes before the interview. I was mistaken. I had a severe stomach issue and ended up having a bowel movement right before the interview. I cleaned myself up quickly and joined the call, but I was still dealing with the aftermath.

During the interview with the COO, I could hear my stomach making loud noises, and I was sweating from the discomfort. I hoped it would end quickly, but the COO kept asking questions. Eventually, I couldn’t hold it any longer and soiled myself during the interview.

Despite the unfortunate situation, the COO said I was a great fit for the position and offered me a job with a three times higher salary than my previous one, along with excellent benefits. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at that point. I ended the call, had to replace my chair, and will likely share this story with my grandchildren in the future.

9ecndr,1536496552,9/9/2018 12:35,confession,When I was a young child I helped my Mom hide her cheating from my Dad and I've lived with the guilt ever since I realized what I did.,"This will be a lengthy wall of text post because I have been keeping this in for so long.

&#x200B;

First she isn't actually my real mom but my much older sister. My birth parents had me late in life but were killed by a drunk driver when I was a toddler and I have no memories of either of them. My sister and her husband adopted me and I have always known them as my parents and their two children as my younger siblings.

&#x200B;

My dad had a job at the time that required him to travel from home frequently.

When I was maybe five or six my mom cheated on my dad.  I don't remember too much of the specifics but I do remember a time there were two strange men I've never seen before in our house when  my dad was out of town.  One of the guys had even played xbox with me while the other guy was alone with my mom in her room. As a kid I didn't know what they were doing.  Afterwards mom told me and my younger brother to keep it a secret from dad. I remember other instances of mom having me and my brother in the car when she went to pick up men I didn't know and bringing them home.

&#x200B;

I don't know how much time passed but I remember dad asking me if any strange men came over the house at night saying that my brother told him about them. I immediately lied to my dad and told him that I've never seen any strange men around and that my brother was making things up.  Nothing else happened after that and my dad eventually got a new job that didn't require as much travel.

&#x200B;

I feel guilty for what I did but am too afraid to ask my mom about it. Its been over fifteen years since then and my mom and dad seem to be happily married. I have a younger brother still in school and I don't want to break up the family over something that might not even be real.  I feel guilty and hurt because my dad has always treated me with love and support and no differently than how he treats his real sons. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that if he ever found out he would cut me out of his life, which is stupid I know, I mean I was only a little kid but still.

&#x200B;

I try to rationalize keeping it a secret thinking that maybe he already knew since the suspicion was there and maybe they had worked it out behind the scenes when I was still an ignorant school kid. So talking about it would only bring back painful memories.

&#x200B;

I just really hate my mom sometimes and get these angry suspicions that she is still cheating when there is no evidence of it, but I hide it well. I blame her for my fear of being cheated on, but I still love her. So I just keep it inside.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for your kind words. I was really afraid I would just see a bunch of posts shaming my mom and calling her names, which is not what I wanted to see.  I know what she did was awful but I still love her.",4348,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rkjqav,1639993803,12/20/2021 9:50,offmychest,My dad molested me when I was 11,"I (22 F) honestly don't remember how I got into the situation I was in, but for some reason one evening I decided to nap in my parents bed instead of my own while my dad was drinking. Since I could remember I've used sleeping kinda like the meditation mechanic in the Witcher lol. Just to skip time or when i was upset and i didnt feel like dealing with it. I usually cover myself fully and pull the blanket over my head. My mom does this too, so I guess I got it from her.

I was like. Half asleep. And I remember feeling the bed dip and I knew it was my dad since my mom was gone? I don't really remember where she was. I thought he was just going to nap with me. But I was terribly wrong. I just remember my blood going cold, and my body going numb while he started to touch me. Between my thighs, my butt, everything. I felt like my skin was melting off. I remember snapping to and clenching my butt thinking he would stop and he didn't, so I rolled away and got off the bed. He was trying to reach for my arm and saying something to me. I would assume he was saying sorry and ""I thought you were your mom!"" but I couldn't hear anything, my blood was pounding in my ears. I ran to the door of the bedroom and my mom was standing there, looking at me asking what was wrong. She kept asking me what was wrong, I kept saying nothing but then she asked me if he touched me. I lied. I said no, he was just being annoying. Went to my room and went to sleep. No one ever brought it up again. 

For a long time I just wrote this off as an accident. Telling myself it wasn't supposed to happen, and ignored it. I've never acknowledged it, hoping it would be less real. About a month ago, I was thinking about it. I was 11. 5'2. My mom? Late 30's. 5'8. Much bigger than me. At this moment I realized that he lied. He knew it was me. He had to. Theres no way. What's more is my whole teen/young adult life he's made passing remarks when I wear make up, or dress nice and he will call me pretty or gorgeous. Normal dad doting on their only child/daughter thing right?? But sometimes he calls me sexy. And it makes my skin crawl. He's a bit weird and I just. Kinda figure oh that's my dad, he says weird shit, whatever. Dont wanna be even weirder and make a big deal out of it so I'll ignore it. But I've come to realize i was just lying to myself this whole time. I know it's creepy. He HAS to know its creepy...And I know if someone was in my shoes I would tell them its wrong and not okay, so why is it okay when it happens to me???

Something else I feel like saying that may or may not be related is my early childhood is really really blurry. I dont remember any of it. Maybe little scenes, but nothing detailed. But something I can remember pretty well is being..sexually inclined to put it lightly..since I was 3 or 4. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] making accusations or anything, but I can't help but wonder if my inner child is protecting me from something even more terrifying than the story I shared. Its a really scary thought. And I really wanted to believe that everything truly was an accident, and that my dad just loves me a lot. I really really wanted to believe that. I just don't think it's in line with reality. 

If you read all this, thank you so much for listening to me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if this is appropriate for this sub, but a friend recommended it to me and I took her word for it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not really an avid reddior, i just wanted a place to share my story. So..here I am. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] hoping that this being out there will make it feel more real and less like it's just in my head.",6,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1ll054a,1750944467,6/26/2025 13:27,stories,"16 y/o family ""friend"" sa'ed me when I was 7. Years later, he visited my dad on his deathbed with his wife and kids.","As a kid I, 25 female, use to live in a small apartment complex with most of the tenants being families with multiple children. One of my neighbors being a relative and another neighbor ended up becoming my godparents, because of this it was common for the kids to take turns going to one another's houses, playing outside, and just hanging out. All of the Families use to plan holidays together, camping trips, and attend each others parties. It was easy to see one another as family. 

There was one family who at the time had one son Oleander, 16M, and two daughters just a few years older than me, Calypso 9 and Delilah 12 . So one random night they invite me to a sleepover. Of course my mom had no issue with it since their apartment was across from us. We did the usual girl sleepover things then we went to sleep. I remember waking up with the lights on, my night gown was pulled up around my waist, and my underwear was pulled down by my knees. I looked around and did not see the girls anywhere. I heard footsteps. I was scared so I fixed my clothes and pretended I was asleep. That's when Oleander came into the room again and proceeded until he was satisfied. 

I grew up in a traditional Mexican household. Those who experienced that knows how some Hispanic parents can have a conservative outlook on SA. Bc of that I kept my SA a secret until I was in HS and shared  my story with a few friends of mine. As the years went on families moved out, others moved in and the bond between families grew weaker. Enough to the point where I went no contact with Oleander and his family. I no longer had a reminder so I thought about it less and less until I eventually successfully repressed those memories. Or so I thought.

When I was about 23 my dad had a stroke and was hospitalized for about 20 days. Early on  into my dad's hospitalization, Oleander, his wife and kid came to visit him. I was sitting inside of my dad's hospital room with my boyfriend and my younger brother. As soon as I saw him, I got up and immediately excused myself. I ran to the restroom and broke out in tears. The fear of losing my dad was overwhelming enough and I now had to confront the feelings of childhood SA. I told my boyfriend that was my assaulter and we tried to pull my mom to the side to say goodbye and leave right away. (My bf knew abt the assault but not who he was.) Right when I went to grab our bags to hide my tear stained face from my mom, he came out from the icu to the hospital lobby. He had the whole audacity to come out of my dad's hospital room crying. He went straight to his wife and my other family members where they offered him sympathy. I went into shock. 

That's when I realized I did not want him coming to the funeral. (I was still in denial about how my dad was doing so a funeral had not even crossed my mind at this point) It took me a few weeks to be brave enough to have that conversation with my mom and older brother. they both agreed to tell him he is not welcomed at the funeral.

I will definitely say I am [REDACTED_NAME] to unpack what happened when I was younger and seeking out a therapist. I, sometimes, have dreams and flashbacks of suppressed memories. I have been reflecting and realized a few patterns. DISCLAIMER: THESE ARE SOME THEORIES AND SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. THESE ARE MY THOUGHTS AS I UNCOVER MORE INFORMATION AND GO THROUGH PICTURES  OF MY CHILDHOOD.

Oleander's wife is his younger sister's (calypso) best friend and they got together when she was 17/18 and he was about 23/24. Fucking weird if you ask me. 

I was told Oleander tried to convince my older brother to engage in oral sex with him when they were teenagers, not that long after my SA. My brother declined. 

When I was younger I developed a habit of isolating myself and became a reserved child. (Can anyone take any guesses why? lol) I remember feeling isolated and feeling a weird shift in my relationship with Calypso and Delilah as kids. There's multiple instances where they made fun of me, mimicked me, and/or encourage others to join in. I was not confrontational as a child. I was always shy and soft spoken. I got diagnosed with ADHD later as an adult.

After my dad passed my family threw a few fundraisers and I was forced to be around the same people from my childhood. At this point Oleander has two more younger siblings, Joseph and Natalia. Taking the family from 5ppl to 7ppl around the time my dad passed. When I was there I was observing the sisters' interactions with my family. The way the spoke softly to my younger brother and shared words of encouragement, they hugged my mom gently, rubbing her back when she teared up talking about my dad, and even interacted with my baby nephew making him giggle. Seeing this put me at ease. I felt like this was a non-verbal confirmation that things were not gonna be weird or awkward. I talked to the two youngest siblings, Joseph and Natalia, and we had a smooth, heartfelt conversation. (This fundraiser happened after I told my family and after they told oleander he is not welcomed at the funeral) When calypso and Delilah finally spoke to me they only offered their condolences in a quiet monotone voice. At the time, I noticed and was taken aback by the shift in energy but did not want to draw attention to it. I still tried to be understanding and assumed their social battery ran out or they were starting to get tired. I, now, think they might have known/found out about the assault. I later wondered if the bullying I experienced from them as a kid was because they heard noises/witnessed something? Was that their attempt to try to protect him? Or make sure I don't say anything? Or maybe, they don't know anything and simply don't like  me? I don't really care about how their family may or may not feel about me but I sometimes wish I did speak up back then. I wish I had some sense of justice for what happened to me and how that drastically changed the person I am [REDACTED_NAME]. if people in my real life knew the kind of person Oleander is, would I feel better? Even if I don't feel better, Is it the right thing to do? tell the truth to his wife? Have a one on one convo where I call him out? Tell him I remember and he's a piece of shit and to never contact me again? Idk, idk. I would appreciate some Help! Any other sa survivors feel the same?! How did you heal? I would appreciate any advice and to hear your stories and Thanks for reading. ",15,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hcaiu9,1592606602,6/19/2020 22:43,offmychest,My Canadian experience as a Black man,"I had a pretty traumatic childhood with lots of abuse in the home. My dad was an alcoholic pastor in the black community. When I went to his church as a kid I could feel the anger around me. When I went to church with my school it just didn't feel the same. My dad was passionate and furious and I felt all of that ""passion"" when we were at home. My parents are both from the Caribbean and grew up with children being seen not heard. When I did speak up and out of turn, I got beat. After the beating if I cried I got told, ""I'll give you something to cry about if you don't keep making so much noise."" so I learned fairly early on to be careful around the house with what I said.


At school, it was different. I guess I learned bullying from home because I railed into kids from grades 1-4. I kept getting in school suspensions and detentions which didn't really phase me. When I hit grade 5 however things got a bit different. At that point we had just got a new Principal from Jamaica and she was on my ass constantly. I remember when she would see me in the office she let out a huge sigh, and would ask me what the hell I was doing here again. During that year I got into a fight with a white kid, and we got called to the Principals office. In front of the other little boy, she seemed less animated than she normally would be in telling us off. She gave us a weeks detention, and then told the other boy to go back to class. For me she wanted to have a few more words.


""You are going to Juvenile hall. Next year you will be 12, and with that skin tone and that attitude you are going to be in and out of bars until you end up dead. And I know you are smarter than this. You could do better!"" I sat there trying to understand what was being said, and I looked up and she just looked so disappointed. I can't remember all the things she said, but for the first time, I saw myself in a different light. I felt bad for being less than what I could be. I didn't want to be a statistic. I'm 11 years old and my life is over? She told me to study hard and excel. She really reached me that day, but the lesson wasn't complete.

I stopped fighting, but when I got into high school I realized a bit more of what being black is like. My dad left us when I was in 10th grade, saying he was just too angry and didn't want to end up beating my mom (what about me???). My mom explained to me why she thought he was so angry. In the early 80's my dad was nearing completion of his CPA designation and quickly climbing the corporate ladder at his company. Once he was made Controller however, his boss and stakeholders in the company let him know that nobody with his skin tone was going to be promoted any further. So he quit and started his own business after meeting my mother, and when that didn't work out so well he started to drink and became resentful. Hearing that story about my dad helped me to not become the next generation of angry black man.

A year later, I met a girl and just completely fell in love with her. We talked constantly about our future and getting married... everything seemed so bright, until she dumped me. I pushed her for an explanation, and after a lot of prodding she told me that her mom found out I was black. She was given an ultimatum, dump the boyfriend or be disowned by your family. I was completely distraught, and some of those childhood trauma's popped back up and I fell into a depression. Just before high school ended I managed to cobble together the courses required to get into my University of choice and managed to get in. Still depressed, I almost dropped out, until I remembered in therapy the words my principal had told me so long ago. I can be better than this, I have a bright future and I can reach out for it. It took me until I turned 25 to make it through my degree, but after a few years in the work force I am [REDACTED_NAME] the same point that my Dad was at when he quit his job so long ago. And now with all of this shit happening in the news to my people I need to share my story.

It gets better! I met an amazing woman just before graduating, and we got married a year later. I'm 28 now and I just finally got a grasp on what it means to be black for me. When I was growing up I knew lots of black people who struggled because of the color of their skin. I heard some people say black is beautiful, its powerful, but I never really felt any of that given what life had been like. But I think it is. I would not be who I am [REDACTED_NAME] without my black history, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] of it. Blackness in North America is marked by racism, but we get to define who we are in our response to it. 

TLDR: Through my black elementary school principal's warnings I was able to correct course and become someone I can be proud of today",143,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1d03w3f,1716611222,5/25/2024 4:27,TrueOffMyChest,I gave flowers to my husband today and his reaction made me realize I might be a bad wife.,"Recently, my friends made fun of me (35F) saying that my husband (32M) is the romantic one of our relationship. And aparently he wins by a big margin in that department. They even scoffed at the idea that I could be romantic at all. This made me start to be self conscious about it as one of my friends went on detail how much more romantic he is compared to all my friends husbands and how I am [REDACTED_NAME] total oposite. 

This has been on my mind all week, and today, a male coworker was talking about how his wife gave him flowers and how he was surprisingly happy about it, so I thought ""well, why not? He buys me flowers all the time, I should start being more romantic.""

After work I went to pick up a bouquet and headed home. When I arrived he was playing with our daughter (5yo) and I gave him the bouquet and said ""I was thinking about you and got you this""

He started crying, he cried so so much. He thanked me and hugged me and then went look for a vase to put the flowers. Throughout the night he cried randomly 2 separate times. I asked him if anything else happened for him to be that way and he said no, that he was just happy that I got him flowers and was feeling a bit emotional. 

And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] thinking, am I a terrible wife? He gets me flowers all the time and I never get emotional like that. Not even close. Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] back and I don't do nearly as much for him compared to what he does for me in every way, and my friends are 100% right, romantically he kicks my ass. I just feel absolutely terrible because I love him more than anything. He is my world and I could not even think of myself without him. He is an amaizing husband, an even better father and mostly, he is my best friend. But I guess I don't show him how much I appreciate him and he doesn't know how much I love him and that makes me so sad. And then that makes me feel even worse because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of myself instead of him.

Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in bed, I can't sleep thinking about this, I dont know if I should talk to him about it or if I should just quietly try to be better and show him how much I appreciate him.",12690,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18smrud,1703743485,12/28/2023 6:04,confession,I used garlic and onions in a meal when I was strictly asked not to.,"My stepmother-in-law won't allow my father-in-law to eat anything with garlic or onions, not even garlic powder or onion powder. She claims that it hurts his stomach. So, whenever they're in town and come over for dinner, I refrain from using garlic or onions, which is frustrating because I use those two in just about everything I cook.   

For a little backstory about my step-MIL's cooking, she makes the blandest food. Once, we went to her Thanksgiving dinner. She cooked the turkey around noon, cut it up, and had it out around 3, but no one was allowed over until 5 pm. By the time we arrived, the turkey was cold AF and drier than the Sahara desert. The woman just doesn't know how to make a tasty meal.  

Anyhow, my FIL visited us once without his wife, and I made chicken breast with garlic and onion seasoning, and he loved it. Nothing happened to him after he ate it. He told me that he can eat garlic and onions if they're cooked. But for some reason, when he's around his wife, both of those ingredients are not to be used.  

They visited before Christmas, and we planned a dinner at my house. My sMIL made it a point to call me to remind me not to use garlic or onions. She also called my wife to remind me not to use garlic or onions. I was so annoyed that she made it a point to remind us not to use the two ingredients after years of her constantly reminding us. That night, I cooked the chicken breast with sage, rosemary, thyme, garlic, and onion powder. Both my sMIL and FIL loved the meal. In fact, they commented on how juicy the chicken was and how delicious it tasted. It turns out they both like garlic and onions but, for some reason, just have an issue with it. Also, neither one of them got sick.",2603,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1lshmzc,1751742867,7/5/2025 19:14,offmychest,Broke up with my ex again,"
**Throwaway account because some of my friends know my Reddit and would kill me if they saw this.**

I F(20) and my ex (19) and I met on Instagram when I was 15 and he was 14. We started talking in DMs, and after a while, we began dating. We broke up after 4–5 months because he used to flirt with other girls online just to make me jealous. This happened a few times while we were dating.

A few months later, he texted me again, apologized for everything, and of course, I had to be a saint and forgive him. But I didn’t date him again. We stayed friends, and he kept flirting with me, trying to win me back.

Then, on New Year’s Eve that year, he suddenly blocked me. He said he couldn’t move on if we stayed friends and wished me good luck in life. I was actually happy he finally realized it wasn’t going anywhere and decided to move on.

In 2022, I met my current boyfriend, and I’m still with him. He’s really sweet and helped me love myself again. He supports me, listens without judging, and is always there for me. He’s been my biggest cheerleader since the day we met.

I have a public Instagram art account, and I’m kind of active there. I noticed an account watching my stories that had the same name as my ex. I figured he might just be stalking a little. Since he didn’t text me, I ignored it. About two weeks ago, I saw a message request and realized it was from him. Being the gossip queen I am, I replied. I did tell my boyfriend, and he was chill about it.

My ex and I chatted a little. I kept my replies short and straight to the point so he wouldn’t get any ideas. I stopped replying four days ago because I started to feel like it was wrong to talk to him while being in a relationship.

Today, he messaged asking why my replies were so short when he was sending long, nice messages. I told him he sounded really desperate and reminded him that I’m in a relationship. Then I asked if he ever actually moved on. He said no, he tried, but it was hard because he couldn’t forget about me.

We ended up talking about our past, and honestly, it felt kind of nice to remember my first “love” (if I can even call it that). He told me he got influenced by his friends and flirted with other girls to make me jealous because he thought that would make me more possessive of him. He said he regrets how he acted when we were kids.

I realized I never really hated him, even though he made me feel terrible. Maybe it’s because he was the first guy I ever liked. Then he asked me to give him a proper breakup message, with all the anger and emotions I felt back then. I couldn’t write anything mean, but I still tried.

While I was typing, he texted again saying he loved me back then and maybe still does. He thanked me for the memories and said he’ll try to fall in love again, though he doesn’t think it’s possible right now. He wished me good luck.

I didn’t reply to that. I sent the breakup message (which wasn’t even angry), and before he could respond, I blocked him.

After that, I felt sad. I started thinking about how things might’ve been if he had just communicated better when we were dating. But then I thought about my current boyfriend. Maybe he doesn’t bring the same thrill, but he makes me feel safe. With him, I don’t have to pretend to be someone I’m not.

I don’t think I’ll tell my boyfriend about this,at least not right now,because I know I’m too emotional at the moment.

( I just wanted to rant it out somewhere, and also, i used chatgpt to frame my sentences, English is not my first language and I didn't wanted to sound too stupid)

He used to beat us and yell at us about how worthless we were constantly. My mother finally had enough, and said that either he gets psychological help, or she leaves him. He went to the doctor, and was prescribed an antipsychotic medication. When he started taking it, he magically became nice! No more beatings, no more yelling... it was paradise. Then, after a while, he turned mean again. We asked our Mom what was going on, and she said that he stopped taking his medication because he didn't like the side effects, whatever that meant. We felt doomed. Until one day, my mom accidentally? left his prescription bottle in the kitchen. My sister and I looked at each other and didn't even have to say a thing. She got out a spoon and I ground the white pill into powder, and we put it in his orange juice. What a nice day we had! We did this every single day, enjoying our temporary happy home, until the prescription ran out. It was the best month of our childhood, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sorry.

Edit:

For those saying that antipsychotics take weeks to work, that’s not always the case (in contrast, antidepressants often take weeks to work). People have commented that they’ve taken antipsychotics such as Latuda, Promazine or Seroquel, and they claim they feel the effects in hours. FYI, I have no memory of exactly what drug he was on.

I went to the extent of searching on Google to verify if she had a Twitter account, and she doesn't. I tried to explain that it was likely fake, but he remained adamant, persistently trying to convince me, even though it was an unmistakable fabrication.

As he spoke, a sense of genuine disgust overcame me. It's hard to explain, but it was like a switch flipped in my head, changing my perception of him. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] suggesting people can't be naive, but this went beyond that. One doesn't need to be Einstein to sense that something is amiss. I have zero tolerance for ignorance and plain stupidity; I just can't forgive it.

3c9t1c,1436160965,7/6/2015 5:36,offmychest,My story of emotional abuse and my struggle to forgive and forget,"A year ago, I was pretty naive and unsure of what I was doing in terms of relationships.  I came across this guy who I will refer to as Carlos for the sake of anonymity.  When we first met, we mostly chatted on Facebook.  Initially, I was fascinated with him.  He seemed like a nice guy.  He also seemed Bohemian, artistic, open-minded, ambitious, and very peaceful.  The downsides?  He was/is an illegal immigrant from Mexico and he was eight years older than me.  I met him when I was 18 and he was 26. 

Shortly after, we started dating.  Initially, I told him I didn't really want a serious relationship, but he beckoned me into it.  At the time, I was a pretty casual person and didn't mind a fling here and there.  He, on the other hand, wanted more.  The first time we got together for a date was also the first time I slept with him.  Thinking about it, the situation was really stupid.  For all I know, I could have been killed that night in a hotel room half an hour away from the college campus I lived at.  I don't think ""foolish"" even amounts to how bad of a decision that could have been.  Regardless, it happened and the next day at lunch, he started to talk seriously.  I was casually playing a game on my phone at the time when he took it out of my hands, put it facedown on the table, and showed me pictures from his life.  At the time, I passed it off as ""a little rude"" but ""shame on me for playing on my phone at a lunch date.""  He then said he expected loyalty from me.  I told him I wasn't looking for a serious relationship.  He repeated himself again.  I don't remember much after that but I know now his behavior should have been a red flag right then and there for his rude insistence.  I'll emphasize again: I was pretty stupid.

A few weeks later, I ended up dating him.  Things seemed fine.  For the most part, he was artsy and really sweet.  Then, after about a month, things started to go downhill.  All of a sudden, he wasn't so sweet anymore.  If anything, he had an insistence for things to go his way - whether or not it was an inconvenience for me.  On top of that, I noticed he talked too much - especially about himself and his accomplishments - like how far he had come from being a beggar on the street to now having a job, his own lawn care business, and goes to college.  I think I heard that story way too many times.  

But, what started to occur that was really distressful was his urge to get control of me.  For instance, the first time we fought was on the phone over birth control.  Mr. Pursuit-of-Knowledge himself didn't quite understand biology.  I was and still am a pharmacy major and had just finished and passed intensive biology and chemistry courses.  Nonetheless, he insisted birth control was another drug that was bad and can lead to addiction and wanted me off of it.  I refused and tried to educate him about how birth control works and how it doesn't harm me at all.  Then, he started screaming at me about how birth control was like crack cocaine and how it'll ruin me.  I ended up crying and he threatened to break up with me unless I stopped my birth control.  I told him I would do it to get him to stop yelling at me and because I didn't want to lose him.  I thought I must have done something wrong to anger him because it never happened before.  Something I did just HAD to have set him off because he never yells.  Ever.  

Well, I didn't discontinue it.  I told him my parents wouldn't let me stop taking birth control and I didn't want to make them angry.  This was partially true.  The other part was that I didn't want to come off of it because he didn't like using condoms.  Oh, speaking of which, the sex?  Looking back on it, he had an insistence that every time we did it, we were ""making love.""  Not ""fucking"", not ""banging"", not even ""sex"", but ""making love.""  Because of him, to this day, I despise that term.  His version of ""making love"" was not on par with its definition.  It seemed to me like raw sex, rougher than any other partner I had been with.  The guy had no real sense of what it meant to be gentle.  Quite a few times, I have bled from the occasion of him being too rough.  Why did I continue screwing this guy, you may ask?  Because I thought eventually I would get used to it and my body would adjust.  Again, I still wanted to believe this person was still the nice Bohemian man trying to live a good and peaceful life.

I was with this horrible person for four months.  Do I sound like a bitter ex girlfriend?  Because I definitely am.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] as hell that I wasted so much time and energy with this monster.  For the duration of last summer, he fought with me on any topic he could find an excuse to fight me with.  Defending myself was out of the question even when I tried to keep things calm.  He would still resort to screaming and cursing at me if I didn't agree with him.  And crying wouldn't get him to stop.  Instead, he'd scream even more.

""Stop fucking crying!"" He would yell, ""What the fuck are you crying  for, huh?""  

Whether in person having an argument with him in his vehicle or on the phone, this moment would have me sobbing with my head in between my knees or buried in my hands begging for him to stop yelling at me.  I had to beg to get him to comfort me.  Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.  But if I acted cold afterwards, it would then be his turn to beg - like all of a sudden he was a victim.  He would never truly apologize for his actions, but rather remind me how much he loved me and wanted me to be strong and knew I was still young but he would help me grow.  And it would somehow work almost every time.

The guilt tripping was like a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card for him.  Every time I would try to break up with him, he would rapidly send pictures of us together, reminding me of how happy we were, he would promise to be the Sweet Carlos I fell in love with, and he would tell me how much he loved me, wanted to marry me as soon as I graduated, had big plans for our life together, was crying so much and so much more.  At some point, I don't know if I stayed with him because I wanted to change him, felt sorry for him, or because I was afraid of him.  I've felt all three at some point in the relationship.

He also hated some of my hobbies too.  For instance, I love video games.  I always have.  Him?  He hated video games.  If I was playing a game and he called me, he would get angry if I try to have a conversation with him and play at the same time.  One time, on my birthday, I invited him over to my dorm room where some friends and I hung out to play games together.  Instead of participating with us, he played on his phone the entire time.  Sometimes, he would use that hobby against me in arguments to demonstrate how lazy I was compared to his hardworking self who gardened and mowed lawns for a living.  Did it ever occur to him that I was still a college student with only a part time job?

But what he hated more than that were the people I interacted with.  He hated my father for not approving of him because he's an illegal immigrant.  He said my father was an ignorant racist for not sympathizing with his situation.  Keep in mind, my father is married to my mother who's an immigrant from the Philippines.  He worked hard to bring her and my grandmother here into the country legally.  In my dad's eyes, Carlos had no excuse not to wait in line like everyone else.  Carlos, on the other hand, couldn't wait to sweep me away from my family and have me all to himself.

But more so, Carlos hated any male I interacted with: whether it be a childhood friend, a college friend, a coworker, or even my manager: he was always - ALWAYS - extremely jealous.  If I simply talked to a guy friend and mentioned it later, he had to know what we talked about and would get angry that we talked in the first place.  To him, every male figure was trying to get into my pants or steal me away.  To him, I was a potential cheater.  And no matter how many times I would reassure him that I would not cheat on him, he was always suspicious of me - for even the littlest of things like browsing Facebook late at night or listening to the same music my coworkers would listen to (it didn't matter I had that Reggaeton playlist on Spotify years before I met him - I was still ""influenced"" by the Central American guys at work who were trying to ""hit on me"").

In general, I felt trapped with him - tied down in a relationship I didn't want to be involved with in the first place.  And he would continue to use personal things I told him against me.  That thing about cheating?  Well before him, I cheated on my last boyfriend.  I stayed single for a while because I felt like I needed a lot of time before getting into another relationship.  On top of that, I felt extremely guilty for what I had done.  My last boyfriend may have pushed me away on many levels, but at least he wasn't unfaithful (to my knowledge) and I hurt him and destroyed whatever was left of our relationship.  So, when Carlos used the fact I cheated on my last boyfriend against me as a reason why I am [REDACTED_NAME] allowed to interact with any men...I felt like I deserved it as punishment for my vile sin.  In a way, staying with Carlos was like a punishment I deserved for what I did to my last boyfriend.  Who was I to complain about a bad guy when quite frankly, I wasn't a good person to begin with?  I had started to accept my fate.

I had two wake-up calls that had me reconsidering the relationship.

The first was during sex.  At this time, we were in a hotel room and he was performing oral sex on me to try to get me to climax.  I just happen to be a difficult person when it comes to climaxing thanks to other people.  Solo, I do just fine.  Others, however, have to learn and adjust to my body to satisfy me.  I didn't choose it.  It's how I am.  However, after ten minutes and still no result, he threw my legs aside and started yelling at me for not coming.  I didn't know what to do.  There I was, naked and vulnerable before him, and he wanted to hurt me emotionally right then and there because my inability to climax with him was somehow my fault.  I remember how he put his hands on his hips, looked distastefully at my genitals, then demanded I show him how I ""do myself.""  I refused and I started crying, going back to fetal position once again, and wanting to know why he was acting like this.  After a minute or two, I got off the bed and tried to put my clothes on.  He came over and yanked them away from me.

""Stop!  I don't want it."" I told him.

His reply?  ""I'll make you want it.""  He then threw me onto the bed and started performing oral sex on me again.  Initially, I tried to struggle but then I gave up.  After a few minutes, he stopped, admitting he spoiled it and left it at that.  He never truly apologized. 

 Later that night, I tried to talk with him about the incident on the phone.  He wouldn't discuss it.  Instead, he got angry at me for bringing up something already done and over with and wanted to get a good night's sleep.  This was the first and only time I ever said, ""Fuck you, Carlos."" before hanging up on him.  Later on, he would text me that I crossed the line.  Then, he called me with his voice thundering once more at how I was wrong in the first place and how I ""fucked up his night.""  This would be the first time I relished his anger.  But despite that, he always wanted the last word.  After he hung up, I had a breakdown.  I wanted answers.  I wanted to know why he treated me the way he did earlier.  I didn't give two shits about his beauty sleep because too many nights he had left me restless.  He refused to answer and texted me that he was going to sleep whether I liked it or not.  I remember asking how can sleep like nothing happened.  His answer:

""Because I am [REDACTED_NAME] peace.  There is nothing that disturbs me right now.""

It was like a shameful mockery of the peaceful man I thought he was, slammed into my face in the wake of an admission he would never feel sorry for how he treated me.  No amount of making me cry or making me suffer at night would faze him.  Because somehow he felt perfectly fine treating me like he owned me.  That's when I really became afraid of him.  How was I supposed to marry this guy?  If this is how he treats me now, how would I be treated if he was legally entitled to me?  It's safe to say that for the last month, I had already broken up with him in my head and was finding ways to do the same in real life.

The second incident occurred in a restaurant he invited me out to lunch to.  Considering the date was his idea, I thought he would pay.  However, he said our check would be separate because he's having financial issues.  This annoyed me but I took a moment to check my bank account to make sure I had enough funds and then decided to treat myself with a nice lunch.  He somehow saw the amount I had in my savings and was surprised I had $600 saved up.  I shrugged it off and admitted I did because I regularly save at least %75 of my paycheck every time I get one.  Keep in mind, this was done over the whole summer with one job and then another - both part time and both just about minimum wage.  

Then, he insisted I pay for both of us.  Why?  Because I had the money to do so.  I refused, explaining I was only paid $60 because I didn't work a lot of hours the past two weeks and I needed to save the rest of my money.  He then criticized me for not being considerate to his situation.  When we got our meals, I tried to change the subject, but he remained cold to me throughout the entire meal.  It didn't matter that he had two jobs and was paid more than me.  He had more to pay for like gas, bills, and college.  To him, I was a spoiled middle class girl who could afford to spend half her paycheck on a meal he invited me out to.  So, the pressure continued until I eventually gave in and payed $30 for both of us.  It was then that he started being sweet to me all of a sudden, without saying as much of a thank you.  Just another, ""I love you, cosita.""  

I stormed out of the restaurant and he followed me, asking about my attitude.  I raged at him, telling him that pressuring me to pay for him was unnecessary and rude and that he should never do that to me.  He laughed it off like I was joking.  This infuriated me more and I told him he was selfish and I was sick of him using me.  He then turned serious and said, ""Oh, it's always about money with you!  You American people are so obsessed with it!  Take your fucking money!""  He opened his wallet - full of cash - and tried to toss $40 at me.  I refused it because the damage was already done.  He had manipulated me and that was the issue - not money. 

That night, I finally broke up with him for good.  It took advice from my parents to really push me to do it, but they told me that there are way better men out there who would treat me better.  My father suspected he was trying to get at our family's money and the incident at the restaurant only confirmed his beliefs.  

And how he raged.  First, Carlos was cold and angry.  Then, anger turned into hateful - calling me a heartless ""b----"" in the process and hoping I would wake up someday and realize my mistake.  Unfortunately for him, my only mistake was dating him in the first place.  After enough insults, I blocked him on my phone and on Facebook.  However, he had another Facebook account linked to his Lawn Care company that he used to continue messaging me the next day - begging me back, telling me how much he loved me, how he doesn't understand why I had to break his heart like this, etc.  And let's not forget the pictures he sent of us together or him crying.  He was so pathetic I almost felt sorry for him.  He wanted to know so bad what he did to make me leave him so I gave him a good hard list of all he had done to hurt me.  His answer?  There wasn't any.  He kept trying to change the subject.  The man was a coward and too prideful to admit he was wrong.  The issue was never him, but more along the lines of me being too young to understand his ""good intentions"" or me not appreciative of his ""love"" or other bullshit.  I blocked him for good after.  Then, I was able to make my way back to my university to start a new year and hopefully, a new beginning.  My friends were very supportive and understanding of what I had just gone through.  

A few months later, he managed to message me on WhatsApp after I set up an account to talk with a friend.  He talked about how he was still in love with me and how I was a true woman who straightened him out.  Still no apology.  I ignored it as I was dating another guy at the time and had no interest in even addressing my ex.

Fast forward another month and he surprises me by showing up to my workplace in my hometown.  I don't even address him.  Instead, I hide in the back room until he leaves and I call my father and my current boyfriend for support.  My father came to escort me back home to make sure my ex didn't follow me.  My current boyfriend helped me calm down and reassured me that things will be okay.

A couple weeks later and he messages me on Facebook.  I had unblocked him for the intention of sending him a warning that I would file a restraining order if he didn't leave me alone but never got around to it.  It was on New Years day and he said, ""Hope 2015 is better than 2014 for all it's worth.""  At this time, I was with my current boyfriend in a big city enjoying the celebration.  I didn't respond and yet I didn't send a warning.  He was only wishing a happy new year so there wasn't much harm. 

Two weeks after that, he sent pictures of an art piece he worked on ""in my honor"" of this Japanese woman with a pastel background.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Japanese.  And I don't see how that was in my honor in any way.  Either way, I was fed up with his messages and my current boyfriend noticed it too.  

Eventually I mustered the strength to write him a warning.  Either he leave me alone or I take legal action.  I wrote especially, ""Considering the status of your lack of citizenship, I wouldn't push this boundary any further if I were you."" 
I sent it through Facebook and blocked him forever more.  I did this with the help of my best friend and my current boyfriend.  At the moment, I felt relieved and at the same time, free.

But now, I still struggle to this day with forgetting my abusive ex.  Emotional abuse isn't always taken seriously, but many scars are left behind and my experience was traumatizing.  There are still moments where I have flashbacks of last year and I just feel all this rage within me.  I have also had to deal with issues of insecurity.  Luckily, my current boyfriend has been and still is wonderful to me.  He has helped me heal and has shown me what true love really is.  

But how can I let go of all this hatred I have for my ex?  He's gone but I feel there wasn't enough justice done.  Part of me truly wants him to suffer like I did, part of me wants him deported, and the darkest part of me wouldn't care if he was dead.  I feel so happy in my current relationship but I can't forget my ex abuser.  The memories still haunt me to this day and all I feel is the pure hatred I have towards him for hurting me and ultimately turning me into a much darker person than I used to be.  I used to be carefree and hopeful for a fairy tale relationship.  That monster took my hopes and trapped me in a relationship that would scar me with trust issues, insecurity, prejudice for illegal immigrants, and cynicism.  

I want to let it all go, and maybe I want to find it in myself to forgive him.  But I can't.  I just can't.  How do I fix this?

Tl;dr:  Story of ex abuser and it's been a year and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a very good person now.  It' just that I struggle to forgive and forget the experience altogether.

I have to admit though.  Writing this out helped a lot.",1,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k7uhdn,1607264168,12/6/2020 14:16,offmychest,My heart hurts and I want to tell my story. It makes me feel better thinking about all of you out there. ♥️,"A couple of weeks ago, one of the little girls in my youth group died in a car wreck. I didn't know her super well. I haven't been a leader at that youth group for a few years now, but her death hit me really hard. I felt bad for grieving so much, because I felt like I didn't have the right. The thing is, she only has one sibling; an older sister. And the whole thing happened so close to home... they live right down the road from us. It felt like a close call... like it could have been my little sis. I felt wrecked and bereaved as though I had lost Jessie and yet I hadn't... I still don't understand that...why it hurt so much.I keep thinking about the correlation between social media usage and the rising number of people struggling with depression. I felt like I had been keeping up with the girl's family, even though I haven't talked to them in over a year. I think maybe the world is starting to mistake seeing someone's picture on Facebook for being with them. Maybe we are missing real human connection. Why is it that when I am [REDACTED_NAME], I want to post what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on Instagram or Facebook. Before social media, I always wanted to turn on the radio. I study better when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] noise or in a coffee shop... I don't know... I mean maybe other people don't struggle with this as much as I do... with not wanting to be alone. It's odd, because I get so overwhelmed when I am [REDACTED_NAME] around people.At first I think, well I need attention and that's why. Why do I need attention though? Who's attention do I want? And then I realized...I just want to be somebody worth remembering. Somebody people love and want to have around. But that leaves me wondering if I am [REDACTED_NAME] who even I love and would want to have around.This year I read a book called, The Road Back to You: An Enneagram Journey to Self-Discovery. An Enneagram is basically a personality type. There are 9 of them, and the whole idea is that our personality is actually a mask we wear (""persona"" = ""mask"" in latin.) We put them on when we are very little, while we are learning to deal with the world. In a way, it's like a defense mechanism. Now, I don't know how accurate it is, but it seems to be based on psychology and not astrology. ;) My type felt very on the nose... if that makes sense. The test told me that I am [REDACTED_NAME] 2: The Helper and that I fear being unloved and unwanted. Are you following my train of thought now?The book told me that the harmful message I heard from the world at around 3 years old was that I had to hide my needs and help others with theirs in order to be loved. That no one would want me if I didn't. Just typing that hurts because even telling you, feels like admitting my most intrinsic fear. My enneagram also struggles with pride.... ouch.I have been working and making money since I was 11 years old. I would babysit or clean houses. I even did a lot of yard work for people after giving them a very feminist, ""I can work just as hard as a boy"" speech. I would make money and spend it on my friends. I would buy them really nice presents and I would always pick up the bill when we hung out or went to lunch. I honestly felt and still feel like if I didn't do that, they wouldn't want to hang out with me. I couldn't bear the idea of telling them I couldn't afford it. It's hard to break that habit even now, but it's good to know my motivation. It helps me rationalize in the moment.I have been thinking about all of this, because I feel like I change who I am [REDACTED_NAME] I date someone. I know that I want to be a wife and a mother someday and that, personally, it's in my nature to be submissive; but I don't want to lose who I am [REDACTED_NAME] reaching for who I want to be. I want to be someone of substance and character. Someone whose beliefs don't change depending on who I'm [REDACTED_NAME].Recently, I read Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes. A timely read in my search of self. If you haven't read it, the book is about a mentally ill man named Charlie who undergoes surgery to become intelligent. At first, the operation succeeds far beyond what the surgeons and scientists had hoped. However, over time he recedes farther back in his mind until he is even more ill than he was in the beginning. During the peak of his intelligence, his mind is elevated to the status of great scholars and intellectuals and he says:“Although we know the end of the maze holds death (and it is something I have not always known--not long ago the adolescent in me thought death could happen only to other people), I see now that the path I choose through that maze makes me what I am. I am [REDACTED_NAME] only a thing, but also a way of being--one of many ways--and knowing the paths I have followed and the ones left to take will help me understand what I am [REDACTED_NAME].” ― Daniel Keyes, Flowers for AlgernonI loved this quote because I also believed that death could only happen to other people. It wasn't until they found a cyst in my brain that I started to feel differently. It's hard to live in denial when you wake up in the middle of the night throwing up. Feeling all the muscles in your face spasm and piercing pain in your ear because of the nerve damage leftover from Bell's palsy... feeling your arm shaking until it's in your shoulders and then falling into a fitful sleep for days at a time afterward. There was an illusion shattered during that time, that I was entitled to years or even hours of my life. The illnesses I had thought connected, ended up being smaller issues, all aggravated by stress, and anxiety. There were things that happened during that year that still haunt me. Things said and done to me that I didn't know how to stop. Too submissive. Too quiet. Fight, Flight, Freeze, or Faint...and I Froze. I'll tell you about some of those things, but the point of the quote is that they don't have to define where I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. They just helped me get to where I am. That's why I can be grateful now. Glad that what happened wasn't worse. It was a big lesson that I learned in the safest possible way. I think I loved Flowers for Algernon, because it was one giant admonition to those who take advantage of the weak.I am [REDACTED_NAME] all of these things up for a reason. Over this last year, I felt myself changing. I felt myself becoming weak in my mind. Weak in my convictions. Bereft of emotion. I felt myself ignoring my conscience and falling prey to sin that I could have easily overcome a few months earlier. I became irritable, and unhappy. Impatient and proud. I don't want my friends to feel like I am [REDACTED_NAME] condescending. Giving advice when I haven't earned the right or the wisdom. I don't want to be someone who listens just to reply. I became someone I hated. I hated myself ever having considered marrying John. He would have been emotionally abusive and manipulative. I would have fallen into the same trap that I fell into at the pizza shop. Why am I like this? What is it I want or feel I need?That's what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to figure out. I don't know if I ever will figure all of it out. There were days where on my way home from therapy, I would think that I knew. That I had solved it. But then I'd wake up from another nightmare and wonder why I was still having those. It's always the same. I am [REDACTED_NAME] a building, somewhere with aisles like the make-line at the pizza shop. Maybe a grocery store. Maybe a hallway. And he's closing the distance. He's so much taller than me and I can't move. And just when he is about to get to me, I wake up shaking.I want to tell you what happened, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] to get this out in writing. Mostly because I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I didn't do more to stand up for myself. My trauma wasn't huge. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to use the word trauma. I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I was so sensitive. But it's an important part in understanding who I am.When I turned 17, I had just graduated a year early from High School. I graduated with a 4.0GPA and I had a lot of high opinions of myself. Somehow, I got offered a job at Target on the same day I got offered a job at the pizza shop. I turned Target down with the hope that I would be promoted faster at the pizza shop. It was the first time I had prayed about a decision and felt peace about which way to move forward. I was a crew member for the first 7 months and I worked 40+ hours/week. I covered for every shift I could and I made it my goal to save up enough money for college. The owner started to take a special interest in me. Often he would use me as an example of good behavior in store meetings. He would praise my work and he made me head cashier very quickly. As time went on, he would walk me around the store, ""coaching me"" as he called it. The first time he yelled at me, it was more like a whisper. I was helping customers and they said something nice about me to him. They left and he walked up to me and put his hands on my shoulders. He walked me over to the another section of the register and pushed me up against it (this was an area I had been warned not to touch because it was essentially his desk) and he whispered very angrily, ""If you ever want to cashier here again, you'll clean up you're mess..."" and the rest I can't remember. I thought that was how it was at entry-level jobs. There was always something illegal happening. It's better the devil you know...so I let it go. I cried while doing dishes the rest of that night and I told myself that I would do better next time. I would make him proud. I felt it was my fault.These little abuses continued and they got increasingly worse after each promotion. My therapist told me that I had developed a trauma bond with him. It enabled me to see past a lot of things that any rational person wouldn't have put up with. He would yell until I was crying and then he would make fun of me. I would follow him around the store or he would pull my arm to follow him. He would yell at me if the person who closed didn't put the stapler back on the right side of the register. If the person who swept left an olive under the make-line. If the person who restocked soda didn't twist the sodas so the labels faced the front. I was called a pig with lipstick on. I was told that he would yell until I was fleshless on the ground begging for mercy. All said in a way that could be mistaken for a joke...but he was yelling it. And I would freeze up. Unable to speak without sobbing.One day I braided my hair when I put it up. He liked it so much that anytime I wore my hair any other way, he would tell me to go in the back and fix my hair. Under all the pressure, I turned the 10th busiest Papa Murphy's in the nation into a [REDACTED_ADDRESS]ore. I hired good people and trained them. I trained new franchisees and showed them how to run their store. I sold potential franchisees on the idea of owning a store. I felt like I had to please him. His voice was always in my head. I had to win his approval. I had to be his favorite. I was working 76 hrs/week, 12 of which were off the clock. I had to get there early enough to fix the close from the night before and stay late enough to ensure a better close that night.This guy was so insane in retrospect. He would fold 20's a certain way and I was supposed to figure out how much change we needed in 1's, 5's, and quarters just based on how they were folded. He would get angry if I asked and he would time me when I went to the bank and yell if I was gone longer than he thought I should have been. He wanted me to be first in line and if I came back late, he assumed I wasn't.One day, a few weeks after finding out I had Bell's palsy, I got to work and I went to pull dough out of the fridge. I will never forget standing in the fridge and being able to smell his cologne.  I felt my heart start racing, cold sweat, and I was shaking. I was having a panic attack. Because I knew he had to be right around the corner. That at any second, he would be yelling at me again. And I realized that for all the money in the world, I didn't want to live like that anymore. So I went home and I wrote my notice.I made it to the 8th day of my two weeks before losing it. The sadistic regional manager came in to ""help"" that day. One of the Spanish ladies that worked in the morning was taking the trash out and he got in my face and told me it was the job of whoever closed the night before. I started to speak and he spit ""Bullshit!"" I say spit, because he spit on my face when he said it. He was a foot away from me. I tried to cool down and put the produce away, but I couldn't stop crying. I was having another panic attack. So I took my break and I called my dad. I told him I couldn't take another day of it. So he told me to just leave. Until that moment, I honestly didn't believe I could do that. So, still crying, I went back inside. I closed out my register, I grabbed my bag, put my apron on the counter and I started walking out. The regional manager asked me where I was going and I said, ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with the harassment."" and he said, ""what harassment?!"" and I said, ""Your screaming, Greg's screaming (the owner)... I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Derek has my key."" and I left.Typing this has been really hard and I know it is all over the place. Be patient with me. Sometimes I have to talk about smaller subjects before I get to the bigger one that is really bothering me.Leaving there, I went to work for a coffee shop. When I was making coffee during training, I spilled and burned my arm. Everyone laughed because it was a rookie mistake. A minor burn, but I ran to the bathroom anyway because it had triggered a panic attack. I cried and sat on the floor. I actually felt like he was going to come around the corner and hurt me. It scared me so much because, rationally, I knew he didn't work there. That he didn't even know I worked there.That's when I started to go to therapy.  I still pass Papa Murphy's on my way to work. Every time I do, I consider stopping in. A trauma bond is like that. According to PsychCentral.com, ""Trauma bonding is loyalty to a person who is destructive.""I know that what happened to me sucks. But I also know it could have been way worse. That I got lucky. When I repeated my mistake and dated John...I hated myself. Because I don't want to be a victim. I don't want to be quiet and submissive. To be run over like some helpless deer. So I have been taking a self-defense class and a kickboxing class. I have been preparing for the worst so I don't have to feel so scared all the time by stupid things.I don't have panic attacks nearly as often now. I work for a good company and I stay home a lot otherwise. I started running and lost a bunch of weight after everything happened. I have become someone I can count on. I can say that now. So I guess I'm [REDACTED_NAME] dating, because I want to make sure I believe in myself without having a back up plan. Without needing a guy to validate me or contradict my insecurities. I want to feel empowered by myself before I invite someone in.The Bible says: ""Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction."" Isaiah 48:10I truly believe that my experience is exactly that. A refining fire. Something that will make me stronger for storms ahead. Something that will give me more empathy. Something that will help me encourage other people who are hurting.I have to be careful not to use what happened as an excuse to stay a victim. I don't usually talk about it. I used to. I used to tell people about it all the time, because I needed someone to confirm how crazy all of it was. I needed someone to take my side. Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to understand why I still have nightmares. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to find a pattern and identify the causation. How do I end up in these situations and why.Part of me thinks that I am [REDACTED_NAME] for validation from men...but that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. My own dad loves me and is proud of me. He never hit me or even yelled. He would raise his eyebrow and I'd stop whatever I was doing. He always went out of his way to show up for me. He is the word's greatest dad in my eyes. So I don't think I have ""daddy issues""...  I don't know if I'll figure it out tonight and I've practically written a book about it. If you are still reading, I'll leave you with this quote from C.S. Lewis and a request. Be kind to people. People wearing uniforms. People on the other end of the phone. No one is insignificant and your words have more power than you know. Use that power for good and be kind or don't say anything at all.“There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors. This does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn. We must play. But our merriment must be of that kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously - no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption.” ― C.S.

At night there aren’t as many people so if someone’s harassing you it’s hard for others to notice. There was this one guy in particular who would always trap me in a conversation and I would avoid him for this reason. He was old as hell, short, and his breath was pungent (is that a word? idk). Anywho I only had an hour before the gym closed and before he started yapping I said “Hey I only have an hour I’m gonna just do my set” basically telling him to politely back off. He full on ignored me and kept on yapping, inching closer and closer. By this point the girl behind him was mouthing if I was okay and I felt so uncomfortable. He was literally kneeling inches away from me and I felt trapped. I told him multiple times to go, and I even had my headphones on doing hip thrusts and he was still talking. After my set I got up and walked to the water fountain, I was so frustrated I almost cried. I set boundaries and he just didn’t listen to me. The girl from before checked on me and she was genuinely so sweet.

1loubwu,1751350411,7/1/2025 6:13,TrueOffMyChest,I cheated on my IQ test to get a higher score because I have social anxiety... lmao?,"Hi everyone. I am a girl, I am [REDACTED_NAME] years old (but please don't just disregard my story for it), and I have a mess inside me right now, and no one to tell this to, so I’m dumping it all here from a burner account.

This started when I was a little girl: I have always felt I was acting the ""normal"" version of a person, what people were supposed to be like. 

I've always felt different from my classmates and friends, but I could hardly put my finger on the why; I thought I was normal in the mind department, at first, but eventually I came to the conviction that I was stupid. No one thought like me. Where I saw something deep, analysis-worthy, others saw idiotic, banal stuff; they all said I overthought everything at best, that I was stupid was the standard. 

I don't think I can explain this well. I took note of small things that I thought were important while everyone else ""knew"" they were stupid and irrelevant. I thought about all what people took for granted. Everyone else just ""knew"" things while I deeply thought about it and ended up with conclussions all the others told me were crazy, wrong, a stretch.

And even as a little girl, I felt ashamed by the way I was. I thought I was weird. So I started acting: Watched TV shows to copy how kids my age acted, adopted their mannerisms and ways, asked about things I already knew (because ""normal"" kids were supposed to be dumb!), played silly games that really bored me, translated all of my thoughts into smaller, simpler words; what I thought were child-like words. I remember being furious that adults talked to me like I was dumb, not realizing the other kids did need that tone.

In short, I got tired of feeling like an outcast even in my own head.  Became hypervigilant, second-guessing if my every word and action looked ""normal"", ""childlike"" or ""teenlike"" enough. By middle school I was a bizarre portrayal of a caricature of what I thought teenagers were like. Still... it didn't really work. I couldn't crack, mimic, other people's behavior. I still got called 'autistic', as an insult, a million times: for zoning out, not liking what my other classmates were into - popstars, gossip, boys and sports (Not exaggerating when I say those are the only topics EVER). For questioning things and disagreeing with almost everyone on almost everything (even on the ""obvious"" things I got called stupid for), having complex thoughts and making complex relations I couldn't explain without making my speech trangled and confusing aswell, so basically no one understood when I talked; I was deemed smug for being a ""know-it-all"", and so much more. 

Eventually, I started believing I was dumb, ugly, boring, and weird. It got so bad I changed schools seven times and still never felt I fit in with anyone. When I was thirteen, I began having awful panic attacks before school, so my parents homeschooled me.

Then, my mom met this neuropsychopedagogue who is specialized in giftedness, also gifted herself. They together got the idea that I was very probably gifted. Apparently I showed early signs: saying my first word (my own name) at four months old, speaking full sentences at nine months old, teaching myself to read at three, among others.

So I got really hyped up with this idea: honestly I started reading about other gifted people's experiences and though I always believed myself to be very dumb, they ALL hit SO close home. Everything fit perfectly. Under the lights of giftedness, I understood things about myself that were a mystery once. I felt I understood the way I was and why, why my life turned out the way it did, why I never fit.

I even started talking online with other gifted people and finally made amazin, real friends who, despite me finding them intimidating, didn’t judge me. I could share a tangled thought and for once in my life they would actually follow and add to it. For once, I wasn’t mocked for being nerdy or annoying. They were as geeky as me. 

But then everything went to hell when I started my IQ test.

There is nothing to explain. I know for a fact I got every answer wrong. Even the really stupid ones I realized a second after the time limit was over. But I really am a stupid slut who hoped to have a community among... gifted people? I don't know what I was thinking. Well, in other words, just by the second meeting I realized I was totally not gifted. In fact, my scores would realistically be likely lower than average. So, it was over - But - as stupid as it sounds - I’d gotten so attached to the idea. I’d already told my gifted friends I was gifted. 

And, more important than that and even worse, I needed that label to justify why I felt so worthless. so weird, lonely, outcasted, misunderstood and sad. I wanted it as an explanation and redeeming quality, I wanted to say ""I’m not boring and weird and annoying as they said; I’m just too smart for them"" and for it to be true. I found every single story I'd heard from gifted people extremely relatable for the first time in my lifem I wanted that community, full of people that felt just like me.

I couldn't stand losing that. Not even if I had to cheat for it.

So! Here we are. I looked up the test answers (WISC-V), copied them into a notebook, and read them during the sessions. Of course, I aced almost everything. I’m now waiting for results. If I did understand and calculated all of these correctly, I am [REDACTED_NAME] about 140, 150 IQ points.

But hell, why did I think I would be happy with that? I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. It’s meaningless; That number is fake. My original answers were catastrophic. I am [REDACTED_NAME] stupid as I always feared. And those friends I thought I had aren’t real, because I lied to them, and I’ll keep lying.

But the worst of it is; once again, I don't get to belong - anywhere, anywhere at all. I have to lie to myself and everyone to find some value in what I am. 

Is there anything sadder?

1gdt7j8,1730087171,10/28/2024 3:46,stories,Horrific first date overheard at a seafood restaurant,"A heavyset man with red hair and a red beard was sitting across from me to the left at the adjacent table. An elegant young woman with a touch of makeup and saucer eyes sat directly to my left across from him. 

The man began drinking a whiskey cocktail right away. After initially declining, the woman ordered a glass of wine but asked for it to come with her meal. They still brought it out with his drink by mistake. 

The configuration was such that the woman and I shared a booth, although we had separate tables. They were seated at the same time I was. Both appeared to be in their mid twenties. This was a mid-tier restaurant in greater Boston. 

I was a little early and my dinner companion was a little late so I spent about 20 minutes listening to these people’s back and forth. This part of the conversation came after about five minutes of small talk driven entirely by the woman. 

Bored waiting for my dinner companion and socially anxious in the restaurant alone, I began noting down their conversation, a habit of mine. I think of it like doodling but with words. 


*Woman:* So I have to be honest, I’ve never gone out with someone from an app before. I’m not all too familiar with how things like this go. 


*Man:* I’ve been on a lot of these. 


*Woman:* That’s nice! 


*Silence.* 


*Woman:* So was there anything you wanted to know about me? 


*Man:* Sure, like what? 


*Woman:* I mean— never mind. So what’s the difference between a journeyman plumber and a regular plumber? 


*Man:* No difference really. 


*Woman:* Oh. Well I had to go to school for four years. You know, to get my degree, for my job. I always thought it was so cool how some people just got right into working. 


*Man:* I have a degree. 



*Woman:* Oh, that’s cool! What in? 



*Man:* Communications. 


*Woman:* Really?


*Man:* Yeah. What? 



*Woman:* That just caught me a little by surprise. Only because you’re now working in plumbing, I mean. 


*Man:* Sure do. 



*Woman:* You know, I get nervous on first dates sometimes, and I can talk way too much. Don’t hesitate to jump in.  


*Man:* You’re fine. 


*Woman:* So have you lived out here your whole life? 


*Man:* Whole life. 



*Woman:* When people ask me where I’m from I’m never quite sure how to answer because I actually grew up on a houseboat and—


*Man:* Is that why you picked a seafood place? 


*Woman:* Oh, haha. That’s a good one. I’ve never gotten that one. 



*Man stares blankly* 



*Woman:* No, actually my family doesn’t know the first thing about fishing. My parents are marine biologists. They basically research whales. Like how George pretended to on Seinfeld but for real. So we were—


*Man:* You can eat whales?



*Woman:* Uh… No. 



*Man:* Oh. 



*Woman:* Are you feeling alright? If this isn’t a good time or I said something that rubbed you the wrong way, we can do this some other time. 


*Man:* No, you’re fine. 



*Woman:* You know, funny story, I actually studied something different from what I ended up doing for work also. I majored in physics and I only minored in music because I wanted accountability to not forget how to play the piano while I was busy with school. But I enjoyed it so much I thought “Why not take a year and just do music stuff.” And the rest is history. If you’d told me I’d be a professional this time ten years ago I’d have laughed at you. 



*Man:* What kind of money you make doing that? 



*Woman:* Excuse me? 



*Man:* What kind of money you make doing that? 



*Woman:* Oh, you know. It varies. 



*Man:* That’s what I figured. 



*Woman:* Have you been watching anything good on Netflix lately? I’m binging some of my favorite shows from growing up and watching them at such a different stage of life is kind of interesting. 



*Man studies the menu* 


*Woman:* Anything look good to you? 


*Man:* Not really. I’m gonna see if they can just do a regular burger. 


*Woman:* I apologize, I should have checked if you like seafood. 


*Man:* I do. This stuff’s just more or less really overpriced for this area. 



*Woman:* Oh, I wasn’t expecting you to pay. 



*Man:* So you’re paying? Cool, maybe I’ll get something else then too. 


*Woman:* Haha. 


*Man:* What? 



*Woman:* Oh, you’re— You were making a joke right? 



*Man:* What joke?


*Woman:* I meant I didn’t expect you to pay for my half. 


*Man:* Oh. 


*Woman:* You know, I’m not super hungry. I might just stick with the glass of wine. 



*Man:* Okay. I’ll hurry up and order then. The service is mad slow in here it seems like. 



*Woman:* So besides work what are your you know, interests and things?


*Man:* Sports. 


*Woman:* Oh, I like sports too! What do you play? 


*Man:* I had a moment in high school but now I just watch. Would’ve gone pro if that had been what I wanted. 



*Woman:* Uh huh. What else? Oh, I know. Desert island book choice. 



*Man:* I’ve never been to the desert or anything. I kind of like to stay close to home. 



*Woman:* Yeah. Well, I’m actually feeling a little off tonight. I think I might have to call it a night. 



*Man:* Oh, okay. 



*Woman:* I’m just going to go pay for this at the bar. 


*Man:* Okay. 



*Woman:* Well… Yeah. So, have a nice night then. 


*Man:* Yeah yeah, you too. This was chill. I’ll text you. 



*Woman:* Goodbye. 


For all his talk about the pricing, he did stay and eat his off-menu burger. I feel like I hear these non-conversations more and more often, where one or both parties bring nothing to the table and seem like they’re just trying to get it over with. From very new couples to people who seem to have been together a long time. 

Of course this is an extreme example. But the number of young people,  young men in particular, who I encounter that are just existing and seem to make no effort towards *living* is staggering to me. It feels different than even five years ago, when I was on the dating scene. 

Maybe it’s just me. In any case, thanks for reading the story if you’ve come this far!

t8yvly,1646685572,3/7/2022 20:39,TrueOffMyChest,I think my dad might’ve killed someone when i was a kid.,"One night, when I (36f) was about 8 or 9 years old, (mid 90’s), my father took my little brother and I to Blockbuster to pick out movies. We left there and my dad stopped at a corner store for some snacks and he parked on the side of the building. He left me and my brother in the car while he ran in. On his way out, a man came up behind him and held something to his side. My dad, pretended he was going to hand the man his wallet, but he instead elbowed the man in his face and he fell to the ground. The guy got up and came at my dad with a knife and my dad fought it away from him and stabbed him with it. It was long and that shit went all the way in. The guy let out this horrible groan. I can still hear it. He left the guy on the floor writhing, hopped in the car and took off. 

For so many years I thought this was a dream until my little brother mentioned it to me when asking if I remembered. We’ve NEVER brought this up to my father, ever. I’ve always wondered what happened to that guy, but this was way before cell phones and stuff so who knows. It’s crazy the weight that comes off of someone when they say things they’ve always been holding in.",45236,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1k8gtgo,1745684612,4/26/2025 16:23,TrueOffMyChest,My ex-girlfriend (F26) SAed me (M24) almost 2 years ago,"This is going to be a little disorganized. I've been consistently thinking about sharing my story for months on an anonymous post just to see peoples' thoughts, but I just never had the motivation until now.

The ages I posted are our current ages, but this all took place in 2023.

Just to make it easier to follow, I'll call my ex-gf Ivy. I had recently turned 23 and she was 25.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] giving a lot of background and the whole story, just so things make sense. This is probably not the most interesting read, but it's real.

I never really had much luck with dating apps. I did have a couple of relationships from outside of dating apps that were mostly in high school, but nothing ever lasted long. I mostly focused on academics during college and also just did not feel like putting myself out there. Maybe I would have some decent luck if I had some decent pictures of me since I am [REDACTED_NAME] bad at taking pictures of myself and I think I look better now than I have at any point earlier in my life, at least when I actually get decent sleep and do not let my beard grow past like two days.

To this day, the longest relationship that I've ever had is 5 months and that was when I was 16-17. My self esteem and sense of self worth were really bad, and I had been suffering from depression as well as both generalized and social anxiety since I was 15. All of these were factors in why I was so eager to jump into a relationship.

It started off with me and Ivy talking over hinge in the summer of 2023.  I was super invested in her just because she seemed somewhat into me early on and actually replied to me. We started off just talking about movies and hobbies and just spent hours going into conversation as we progressed through the talking stage for the first week or so. I do not remember the exact timeframe, but I think it was a week and a half. I felt a sense of surprise from only talking to Ivy in single messages at a time to long conversations with her. It was difficult to read as good or bad. I was nervous, because she suddenly seemed so interested in talking to me and was super eager to talk.

Within 2 days of talking more consistently, she asked for my number and we just talked through texts. We talked about our interests, life experiences, politics, and found ourselves agreeing with each other a lot and growing more invested in each other. That part was fun, and I had the time to text for hours.

I was not working while awaiting a start date for a decent job offer I had accepted several months earlier. Well, the job offer pay wasn't amazing, but decent for a fairly recent graduate of college who was struggling with job applications earlier.

About two weeks into that talking face, Ivy had a revelation for me. Before we made things more official, she had something to tell me because she felt it was not fair for me to enter a relationship not knowing her full history. She was previously manipulated by her ex-boyfriend at the age of 18 to engage in amateur sex-work that would be filmed. The arrangement involved her filming with strangers to financially provide for him. She explained that she regretted it and only did it because her self-esteem was low and she was worried about her boyfriend at the time. I do not remember the full conversation just because I was just in shock. I felt sick for a day but still talked to her somewhat during that time.

Back then, I was the type of guy to say a partner's past did not matter remotely to me based on my own beliefs. I told her I was okay with it. I genuinely believed it at the time, but looking back, the fact that I was so sick from that news was proof I should not have gone further.

We got more affectionate and intimate in our conversations, but they were just that, conversations. I did not have a car at the time, so driving to a girlfriend while I lived with my parents, who are not accepting of dating due to religion, was a bad idea. I was very emotionally attached to her and got excited to hear from her every day.

My job was eventually going to start in the fall with me moving out to a city that's within hours driving distance but still not close to my parents' house. I won't get too into detail about my job, but it is a corporate position for a very big company. I had an introductory period for a week where I got flown out on a trip in a corporate office out of state, and I facetimed Ivy the whole time when I wasn't doing work-related stuff or sleeping. Between that and texting, we had to be in communication for at least 7 hours a day and it was even higher when I was not working.

A week after that, I started at the building I was assigned to and get trained effectively before actually doing my position. During that training, I was only able to text Ivy for like 5 minutes at a time a few times throughout the day (maybe like 40-50 minutes total). I also found out I was being placed on night shift starting the next week. During that week, I noticed my girlfriend growing distant when I got home and was able to spend more time talking to her.

We did make plans to eat together and then spend time at her place during the weekend following this period. We did it, but my memory of all of that is nearly blank outside of waking up in her house on a Saturday morning. I woke up and had this weird aura with her. It felt felt like she was trying to get me out of there fast.

We talked a little bit over text during the rest of the weekend, but she admitted that with me working on night shift and not being able to talk to her as much, she was losing interest and starting to view me platonically. I felt weird, so I did not fight for the relationship. I gave her an out to just end the relationship, and she agreed. I asked her to not contact me again and cut all contact with her and stated that I would be doing so in my last message. I have done this in almost all of my break-ups due to discomfort around exes after one particular high school ex treated me poorly and nearly ruined my life.

I did not really think much of the relationship outside of ""wow nights broke me up"" and ""my girlfriend was kinda weird"" until months later in the winter. I was drinking with coworkers at a restaurant after we did a training out of city. I had sudden memories of Ivy touching me in a half-awake state and having sex me while I was barely conscious. There was only one night where that could have happened. Despite being buzzed, I acted like a sad drunk and my coworkers viewed it as ""the young guy is a lightweight and had too much to drink"".

I was scared and upset upon realizing that Ivy raped me and I was too stupid and unaware to do anything about it. I had cut mentally blocked so much of Ivy out that I could not even remember her last name, and the last thing I'd want is to reach out to my rapist to get more info on her to report her. I am 99% sure we were drinking together and that she put something in my drink. That would explain why I had no memory of even going to her place or meeting with her before that awkward wake up. And it would explain why I hadn't remembered until that point. I do not drink that often, and when I do, it is only a single beer that goes well with my burger or Taco Bell.

I could not think of why she had done such a thing until I remembered a conversation I had with her. She was very into astrology and viewed it as a legitimate thing to use to judge people, especially relationships. She said something about my Zodiac signs that was weird.

Somehow, multiple planets being the same sign showed that my personality was a red flag and that I could be toxic and a horrible person at worst. Other women online reported stories of having negative experiences with men of my sign. She did not outright call me a bad person for these, but showed disappointment and said it was a red flag. That should have been a fucking red flag for me.

I did end up dating another woman from summer 2024 to fall 2024 for about 2 months. I think I found her very cute and charming at first, but in retrospect, I think I liked her because she was very different from my ex. I unconsciously ""overcorrected"" to avoid making the same mistake

She was sweet and caring, but I was her first boyfriend and she had no experience in any sense. No, we didn't end up becoming intimate. We didn't have much in common.

It felt very difficult to have long conversations with her or truly open up to her, because we had different outlooks on life.

I work a lot of hours at my job and being on night shift conflicted with her own schedule where she worked during the day time.

Her communication was terrible, but she eventually dumped me over text the night after we met for the first time after having a 2 week long gap without seeing each other, and it just felt off. Instead of admitting there was something wrong, she said she was fine and then proceeded to talk about a book she liked for over an hour. I had 3 hours of sleep that day, so my filter was lower, and I insulted the book.

I feel bad about hurting her and wish her the best, but I should not have been dating her.

I think I dated her just for the sake of being in a relationship, and I lacked self-awareness to not see it as such. That was an immature thing to do, and I don't think I will ever do the same again. It's not fair to myself or whoever I date.

I haven't dated since but that's more due to work hours increasing, night shift struggles, a car accident, and the distance from friends/family. Several people in my life have also died, and the grief that comes along with that has made me lose motivation for dating at the moment.

The hardest loss was my best friend seven months ago, and I don't think I can get over that loss so easily. He was basically a brother to me.

I think I should be in the right headspace before making any decisions regarding relationships.

I like the validation my job gives me though. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] better at it than a lot of other people. I'm [REDACTED_NAME]-respected for my competence. I get introduced to all sorts of people I never would have met otherwise. And it helped me get over my 8+ year depression and anxiety. Surviving in a high stakes corporate environment has shown me how strong I am. Losing the bit of extra weight that I wanted gone has also boosted my confidence.

One thing I'll say about my rapist. I still know her instagram handle. I have looked at it a few times. It is fucked up of me to say this, but wow, she gained a lot of weight after we broke up and her new boyfriends are not great looking great either. There's also a lot of pictures of them doing drugs, and no wonder they all look horrible.

I do not know the context, but seeing my rapist not look great has made me feel vindicated. I hate that I have become such a spiteful and hateful person, judging people off of some pictures. But I do think she deserves to be miserable

I miss my old sense of idealism and optimistic, where I would just see the good in people and would not be so judgmental of people because of their pasts, but I have changed a lot, probably for the worst.

This was probably horribly written, but writing out the story of my trauma after working a full night shift has made my writing skills impaired. I'll answer questions or give any needed clarification after getting some sleep.",1,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gd65s0,1588572700,5/4/2020 6:11,stories,Oaths: A tale of two brothers. Ch 1.7," 

Riverstead was nothing like the brothers' home. Where their home was fewer than 100 huts, and just shy of three times that many residents. This town- and a town it was; it was far too large to be a simple village by the brothers' reckoning. It had walls, and was the size of their tribe's home, magnified ten times over.

They were awestruck, they had never seen so many people, it felt like the sum of their tribe was working just the fields outside the walls. To say nothing of the various pillars of smoke and foot traffic that told of more significant numbers.

Its entry was fortified, a triangle fortification that forced anyone coming through the entrance of the town to pass through two gates. On its points stood watchtowers from which guards spectated the incoming travelers wearily.

Major, for his part. Was unphased by the small town and its wooden walls that had impressed the brothers so.

They had traveled through the gate and immediately received an example in the ridiculous variety of humans. A trade caravan was ahead of them, and while they were sure at least *some* of them weren't humans, Major consistently pointed out each of the odd creatures as humans.

A tall man, about as tall as the brothers. But lanky with long ears that wouldn't have been unfit on a rabbit. He seemed to have bark growing on his exposed flesh.

Major pointed him out as being elven in heritage, but more human than not.

Another sported crimson skin and was missing the horns and facial hair that the residents of Riverstead wore. Furthermore, a prehensile tail came from her backside that swayed and danced about as she spoke with the first man.

The rest of the caravan’s members seemed to be of Elven ancestry. They stood tall and watchful with bows and spears. And the shorter red-skinned and tailed humans who milled about them, cheerfully chattering all the while, laden with bags.

They followed the caravan in, passing through the gates and being stopped at the second by a couple of guards. Both were tall for the natives of the town so far as the brothers could tell, But they were towered over by the trio.

The leading guard thumbs the hilt of his sword before clearing his throat and addressing them.

""Purpose for your visit?""

""Travelers, passing through."" Major rumbled back.

The guard hummed back skeptically, looking the brothers up and down, his eyes lingering on their weapons.

""A silver for entry.""

Major blinked, then scowled slightly before reaching into a coin pouch and producing a silver piece.

""Each."" the guard spoke, now eyeing the brother's scales.

Major squinted at the card ""It was three copper for a party of two last time I came through here.""

The guard shrugged. ""Times are tough.""

Major sighed. ""I see."" and promptly reached into his coin pouch and fished out another two silver pieces.

The guard smiled, pocketed the two new pieces, and spoke. ""Well, go on then.""

Major nodded, gave a half-hearted 'Good day.' and continued past the gate, waving the brothers after him.

As they cleared the second gate, Major could be faintly heard mumbling. ""Maybe I will start selling my skills again.""

The brothers barely heard him, but 'barely' meant they had.

""Major, we don't *need* your money. We can manage.""

""Oh, don't ya start that nonsense again. That ain't why I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. If times really are tough, then I expect the local herbalist will be up-charging as severely as the guards. And I can't much tolerate people up-charging on needed healing supplements.""  
He rubbed his chin and spoke again. ""Imma see if I can't speak to the old Anverth. He's the man to go to for that sort of thing here unless my memory fails me. Ya'll wander about, be careful of spending any money. I'll meet ya at the Inn later, I'll bring that paper and get you those recipes I promised."" With a wave, the ogre began to talk off, mumbling about 'price gouging' all the while.

The brothers bid him a farewell, and then turned to each other. With a shrug, they began to listlessly wander into the town.

It didn't take long for them to realize they must be terribly unique in these parts, despite their tribe being only two day’s travel in good weather.

And while trade between the town and the tribe did occur, it usually happened with the traveling caravans such as the one they had entered with. It often wasn't worth the price of entry to the Drakon when they could simply wait on the outside for a Caravan to arrive. The caravans were more likely to give better trades for the regional furs the tribe traded. And wouldn't demand to buy them with the 'money' that was mostly useless to the tribe's hunter/gatherer society.

All this led into the cumulative effect of Drakon being rather rare sights in the town of Riverstead, and it showed in the wonder and fear the residents looked at the brothers with.

The brothers, for their part. Mostly replied in kind.

The beautiful carved and decorated horns that some of the folk had drew their eyes as inevitably as gold would draw a dragon's. And the occasional rare human who was unlike their dark or green-skinned counterparts.

This had allowed the brothers to start seeing the similarities even in very different looking humans. Most notably in their faces. While they came in all colors, facial hair, and clean-shaven; they were always these... strange flat things, and so *expressive.* The humans seemed to be easier to read than books.

And specific stories about them were being proven correct. The tribe educators had told them that humans had a strange and bizarre obsession with animals.

They were right, there were animals everywhere. Dogs huddled in alleys, half-starved. But for as many they saw in that condition, there were just as many healthy. Laying on porches or walking alongside their masters, tails wagging.

And every now and then, they could see humans throw scraps even the scrawny and mangy looking hounds, the ones that clearly weren't even *theirs*.

Not to mention the horses, which they had seen lined up in a strange horse house of some sort. That had been quite flighty as the brothers approached.

And then there were the cats, they walked along the roofs, and it felt like they couldn't go more than two dozen paces without seeing one.

The tribe could not have afforded to feed so many… unneeded animals, and most would have likely been food, rather than be fed.

They watched in quiet wonder as a young- or perhaps just particularly short human, crouched down and began making a clicking noise while holding out a bone of some sort.

The dog that the human had been tempting ventured from the porch it had been lazing upon and lolloped over to the small human and barked eagerly. And after a moment of seemingly friendly taunting, The human raising the bone just out of reach of the house. They finally dropped it for the dog to maul.

Bewildering.

The brothers continued their exploration. Supposedly they were supposed to meet Major at an Inn. Yet, any time they approached a human for directions they quickly walked away.

""Maybe there is some... greeting, we don't know about?"" Asgar asked

Argus thought for a moment, then replied. ""Surely, Major would have told us this?""

Asgar shrugged. ""Maybe he does not know?""

His brother hummed thoughtfully. ""No, that doesn't sound right. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure he'd know something like that.""

Asgar nodded. ""Maybe everyone is just busy?""

The brothers looked over the suddenly empty street.

""That makes sense.""

""How do we find the 'Inn' then.""

""I don't know.""

Asgar looked puzzled. ""Brother, can I ask you a question?""

""Yes.""

""Do you know what an 'Inn' is?""

""...No.""

""It sounds important.""

""Yes, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure it's said with a capital 'I'""

""So a big building then?""

""Yes.""

The brothers, not entirely confident. But with a vague sense of a plan, began to go looking for the most prominent building.

—-

""Please stop disturbing the townsfolk.""

A half dozen guards had approached the brothers mid-search. Apparently, they were 'disturbing the peace' by knocking on the fanciest buildings they could find.

They had been 'fined' two copper for this, and the brothers suspected that this was one of the 'scams' Major had warned them about. But there were six guards, and it was easier to fork over the orangeish coins than pick a fight neither brother really wished to have.

On the bright side, the guards had finally pointed them towards the 'Inn' after warning that any other 'disturbances' would lead to a night in the 'cell.'

The brothers understood almost none of this beyond a vague idea that night in the 'cell' would not be pleasant.

And they felt their opinions of humans fall a bit in general if they were so 'disturbed' by giving out directions. But perhaps humans were just rather shy? There had been shy drakon at their tribe, maybe that was just normal for humans.

Their father had been quite stern with them as children when they'd tried to make Ingram- the smith's son, play outside with them. Ingram was particularly shy.

Perhaps the guards had been chastising them as their father had for bothering shy folk.

The brothers chewed these thoughts over as they approached the 'Inn' which- as the guards had informed them, apparently had *two* names. It was also known as 'The Mug and Cloak' which not only seemed needlessly confusing, but also seemed to be a worse name than 'The Inn' to the brothers.

Eventually, they found the building. It didn't list the word 'Inn' anywhere. It did, however, have a sign on which a picture of an overfull mug was painted. It swung slightly above the entrance.

""Where is the cloak?""

Argus squinted at the sign, which was missing any sort of image of any garment. much less a cloak like the name of the place suggested there should be. ""Maybe they sell cloaks?""

""Did Major want to buy a cloak?""

The brothers thought of the giant ogre purchasing anything from the comparatively small humans and having it fit and shook their heads.

""Maybe he wants us to buy a cloak?""

""Why?""

Asgar thought, before snapping his fingers with a soft metallic *tang*, ""So we can hide our scales, he said they were rather valuable.""

The brothers shivered at the idea of being *descaled* so someone could use them as coins or make armor out of it.

""But why didn't he say so? didn't he say to be careful about purchasing things?""

""He did say he would meet us here, perhaps he intended to help us purchase them?""

""Ah... this makes sense."" Argus nodded, satisfied with his brother's deduction.

They stood in silence before Asgar finally asked. ""...Do we just wait outside for him? Or go in?""

Argus looked at his brother, and then at the 'Inn.' ""We go in, of course, Major won't be around to adventure with us always. New frontiers brother. we took Oaths after all.""

""Right.""

The brothers walked forward confidently, only partially feigning it.

They opened the door to the Inn.

""Why hello there, how can I help- Oh!"" The Inn was warm and welcoming. It reminded them of Major’s cabin but clearly meant for many more people to live in. It was absolutely full of tables and chairs, around and on them sat two dozen humans of various breeds. Most commonly, the natives, but the red-skinned traders and their tall bark-covered guards, were also inside; most of which watched the brothers intently. A bar sat in the back of the room. Though neither brother could identify the odd piece of furniture. Or would have recognized the word 'bar' in this context, for that matter.

Behind the Bar stood a petite green-skinned human woman, with thinly cut mutton chops and a pair of short two-inch horns. A small bell hung from her leftmost horn.

There were also no cloaks, or again. Any other types of garments. Besides, of course, the ones they people inside were wearing, but the brothers doubted those were for sale.

The Innkeeper finally seemed to recover from her surprise.

""Well, uh. Hello there! what do you need?""

""...Cloaks?""

""Oh! Thank Soltris. You'll want to go to the tailor for that. He's down the street from here.""

The brothers looked at the woman, then at each other.

""I think we were wrong.""

Argus nodded gravely. ""So, we just wait here for Major to come and clarify what he meant then?""

Asgar nodded, then turned to the Innkeeper. ""We need to wait here for a friend of ours."" then promptly took an empty seat and table.

""Uh... well..."" She looked around, her friendly smile straining as a handful of customers chose to exit. Then looking back at the pair of Drakon. The BIG Drakon, with weapons, and covered in shiny scales that could probably turn arrows.

""...Ok.""

—-

""Asgar?""

""Yes, Argus?""

""You have heard the saying, 'chewed things over'. Yes?""

""Yes, I have heard this saying at least once today.""

""Why is this saying?""

""I think it is supposed to mean 'talking' about something.""

""But that is not chewing.""

""No, but talking is like chewing. Hence the comparison.""

""Hm, this makes sense. I think I was misusing the saying.""

Asgar nodded, he too, felt like he'd been misusing the saying. He hadn't been talking much at all.

In fact, it had become terribly quiet in the Inn. The only people inside now were the brothers, the Innkeeper, and one or two locals in the far corners of the Inn quietly eating.

Which the brothers suspected was pretty good timing, as the Innkeeper presently had her head resting into the bar. Occasionally she would look up and around and scowl at the empty room.

She had quickly gone from cheerful and full of energy to this lethargic state. Clearly, she needed rest. As she reminded the brothers of Ingrim when he had been up all night smithing, and the rest of the tribe for the matter when the sound of smithing kept them up all night.

Despite her apparent sleepiness, she was still a very courteous host. Continually asking the brothers if they'd like anything to eat or drink. The brothers politely refused, of course, they were already taking up one of her tables. They couldn't take her food too!

Maybe this is why the guards had been upset with them for disturbing people, if humans suddenly swung into this scowling sleepiness. It would make sense that it would be rather rude to disturb them.

Perhaps the Innkeeper should go rest if she was so tired. She must have a bed somewhere to sleep in, Argus decided to ask.

He broke the silence, speaking. ""Where would you find a bed to use?""

The Innkeeper looked up from the bar, squinting at him and scowling. ""Are you serious?""

Argus nodded gravely, she seemed annoyed. He hoped she didn't think he was mocking her. ""One does get tired after a long night and should know when to rest.""

She seemed confused, before shaking her head. ""This is an Inn.""

""Yes, I know this.""

""...Inns rent rooms.""

She had to pay for her own room? ""How much are rooms?"" Argus asked with a rising brow.

She seemed to freeze for a minute, thinking for a moment. If she was struggling to remember room prices, she must be exhausted, maybe he could talk her into letting him watch the Inn for her so she could sleep in peace?

""For you, one gold.""

...

""One gold?!""

She nodded, staring intently at him.

That was ridiculous, was she being scammed? But they were her rooms, weren't they? ...No, of course, they weren't. Otherwise, she'd surely be sleeping in one now.

Argus turned to his brother, switching from the merchant’s tongue and speaking in their tribe's native language. Which now felt oddly foreign over the week or so they'd spent speaking in nothing but Merchant's tongue.

""Brother, I think she's getting scammed.""

""I thought that could only happen to us?""

""Unless Major was very wrong about the value of the gold pieces, that room must cost hundreds of meals.""

""Maybe whoever buys it gets to keep it permanently?""

Argus suddenly felt very silly for jumping to conclusions and cleared his voice. Then spoke to the Innkeeper in the Merchant's tongue. ""How long does one keep the room for one gold?""

""A day,"" she said in a firm tone of voice that made it clear it was absolutely out of her hands.

He turned to his brother again. ""I was right, she is being scammed. She only gets it for a day.""

Asgar hummed. ""Maybe she is wealthy? She has been offering to give us food, and we're not exactly invited guests.""

As the brothers discussed, a voice broke out, one of the residents rising from their table.

""Come now, Beatrice, that's hardly kind to charge them such rates.""

The man who spoke had magnificent ram-like horns and a full beard. His skin was a hue of bronze with hardly a hint of green. He wore a white robe, and on his chest was the symbol of a yellow orb being circled by another.

If one looked closely, they would be able to see little specks of yellow lightly peppered over the robe as a whole.

""They cleared out my bar Sol! And they won't buy anything! They just sit there talking about chewing things!""

""This is an Inn. They are travelers. You cannot pick and choose who you offer sanctuary too.""

""I damn well can if they're gonna run me out of business! They scared off everyone! Even the caravan folk- they were from Goldhome, Sol. They *tip* there!""

""Even still, a gold? You can't really expect them to be able to afford that.""

The Innkeeper suddenly looked like she was at her wit's end. That's when the brothers stood as one, making the Innkeeper jump and suddenly look nervous, even the man in the strange robe eyed them wearily.

The brothers bowed their heads to the Innkeeper, as Argus put a pair of silver pieces on the table they were sitting at. ""Our apologies, I believe we misunderstood the purpose of this place."" and promptly about-faced, and going out the door.

""Oh."" The Innkeeper spoke softly.

—-

Now outside Argus was caught between feeling guilty and fuming.

""She tried to 'scam' us,"" He mumbled hotly.

""Apparently, we were making her quite upset,"" Asgar replied.

""Why?""

His brother shrugged. ""I do not really understand, either. But we did make her upset, and it was her home.""

Argus deflated somewhat. ""I know... but... she seemed kind, What did we do?""

A voice interrupted their discussion. ""Nothing. Intentionally, anyway.""

The brothers started, then turned as the robed man the Innkeeper had called Sol approached them.

""What do you mean?""

""Do you really not know?""

The brothers shook their heads, now staring at him.

The robed man chuckled. ""Ha, I thought myself reasonable. And yet I find I also judged too hastily.""

He cleared his throat. ""My apologies, it just seems rather obvious from my point of view, it is... endearing that you are unaware, I suppose. But I will stop beating around the bush.""  
He took a moment, seemingly chewing over his words. Finally bringing both of his hands together and pointing at the brothers with his index fingers. ""You are... terrifying.""

""What?"" Argus asked.

""You are absolutely terrifying."" He repeated,

""What do you mean, why?"" Argus looked down at himself, almost as if he were looking for whatever the man saw that he didn't.

""You are a giant, bulky..."" He seemed to be choosing his words very carefully. ""-person, covered in scales that shine like armor. You have a mouth that I suspect I could fit my entire head into, and visible talons on your hands and feet.""

The brothers stared at him, perplexed. ""Yes, this is true.""

He tapped his foot before sighing and speaking. ""I suppose you still don't quite get it, perhaps it's a good thing. and I apologize if what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to say hurts you... but you look like monsters, predators, killers.""

The brothers looked at each other, blinked, studying each other. Noting the various parts he mentioned. Then looking at him, who stood two heads shorter than either of them, Then observing his own rounded nubby fingers. The boots that hid his feet, which they could only assume were also without claws. And his teeth were weirdly flat. Only four seemed to have any kinda point to them, and that was likely the orcish blood in him.

It was now that the differences between him and the orcs they had fought were most apparent. While the orcs also had rounded fingers, they had been muscled, far more than any human they'd seen. Even the guard had a series of flat teeth. The orcs had terrible pointed things that likely were used for rending flesh.

The soft brown of this man's eyes was easy to read. They seemed to emit empathy, caution, and yet, to some degree, fear. The orcs eyes had quite literally glowed with bloodlust.

""I see."" Argus finally spoke. He seemed to deflate even more, and even his Oath seemed like it was mournful. It was meant to be a light and inspire hope, not fear.

Sol looked somewhat ashamed. ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to be the one to tell you. My kind varies depending on where you are, in both appearance and culture. Perhaps somewhere they would gladly welcome you with open arms. But here? You will struggle if you intend to stay long.""

Asgar patted Argus on the back, before turning to Sol and saying. ""Thank you for telling us. We were prepared to be scammed, lied to, all manner of things. But Major didn't warn us that they'd fear us.""

""Is this 'Major' one of you?""

Asgar shook his head. ""No, an ogre, with some mixed heritage.""

""Ah, I suspect he didn't know then.""

Asgar nodded.

Sol stepped from one foot to the other awkwardly before clearing his throat. ""Since I doubt you can afford the Inn, I have a home. I live with my mother, but she’s open-minded. Probably more so than me. You'd be welcome.""

Asgar hadn't really thought of where *they* would sleep till the fiasco of the Inn, and a small part suggested he was perhaps relying on Major too much.

""We may have to take you up on that offer... Sol, correct?""

""Yes, and you are?""

""Asgar and this is Argus.""

""A pleasure to meet you both though I wish it would have been better circumstances.""

The brothers responded with a nod for courtesy.

""If you wish to come to my home now, you may. if not, you can find me in the Sanctum of Light.""

""Sanctum of Light?""

""It is a shrine to Soltris, Goddess of Suns and Stars. It's her who is worshipped primarily here.""

""I have not heard this name before.""

""Have you not? I'm [REDACTED_NAME], her handiwork is present in the sky day and night. who do you worship?""

""Tavig, The platinum Dragon.""

""Ahh... Yes, that makes sense. I've heard of him.""

""Tell me of this 'Soltris.' if you would.""

""Gladly! She is the Goddess of travelers, 'She who guides' the 'Mother of stars,' The light. She Guides all travelers. From the impoverished pilgrim to the wealthy merchant. As I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you know, we are on a road and river that both see traffic to bigger cities. We're a resting place for many caravan trails. As such. Her blessings are felt strongly here.""

""I was unaware Riverstead was so trade-focused actually. Though I suppose that explains the ample caravans my people have traded with.""

""You're from the area, then?""

""Close enough to be worth traveling here for.""

The vagueness of the answer appeared to confuse Sol. ""I see.""

""Do you think the Innkeeper will take a message to deliver to Major when he arrives? I do not wish to disturb her place of business anymore then I have.""

""Ah, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] she will if I ask here, what would you like said to him?""

""Just to tell him where we are, I expect we'll want to go to your home if that offer still stands.""

""It does give me a moment to deliver that to her. And then I'll walk you there.""

Sol stepped back inside the Inn, quickly delivering the message with additional directions to his residence. And not without a small amount of pushing on Beatrice's conscience to ensure she did not forget it when the ogre arrived. Though he was sure, it wasn't entirely needed, as ogres were only minimally less scary then drakon.

From there, it was a short walk to Sol's home. It was a simple wooden home that sat squat. The brothers' heads brushed against the doorframe, and they suspected Major would not be able to fit when he arrived. There was a metal heater in the room on the right. And a table in its center, they could softly hear the sounds of cooking coming from a doorway to the left.

Upon entering, they listened to a feminine voice softly call out. ""Is that you, Sol?""

""Yes, mother, it's me. I brought guests!""

""Oh, friends of yours? Are they staying for dinner?""

""Yes, and the night. The inn won't serve them.""

A middle-aged woman with the tell tale sideburns of Riverstead, though missing the more distinct horns, rounded the corner. ""What? That's terrible- oh my!""

Asgar and Argus waved awkwardly, now attempting to *somehow* become less 'scary', if anything it only resulted in them seeming tense. Which most would have argued made them more frightening.

But Sol's mother seemed unphased. ""Drakon! It's been a long time since I've met your kind. And silver! The ones I met were the most beautiful shade of blue. Do you know them? I expect not, you're an entirely different color. Well, not entirely, silver is a sort of bluish, I suppose. But where are my manners? Sit, sit! I know how much drakon like their meat. Sol!"" She fished out a handful of copper pieces from a pot a put them in his hand. ""Go and fetch some meat from the butcher, spend it all. I can tell just by looking at them that they haven't eaten all day."" Asgar attempted to interrupt the hurricane of words spewing from the woman and raised his hand. ""Ma'am, we don't wish to impose-"" ""None of that now, I haven't even finished talking. It's impolite to refuse a host's generosity as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you know quite well, young man. And even ruder still to interrupt someone. You'll break their thought process all up, and you'll get them totally lost. Now where was I? Oh right, blue drakon! But you're not blue, Why did I bring them up? I suppose silver is sort of bluish... I said that, didn't I? Sol? Are you still here? Go go go.""

She shooed her son out of the house and turned. ""Right then, how old are you? You're quite tall even for drakon! I think! Maybe I just met a particularly short drakon, I never asked. They still seemed quite tall to me, but then you're even taller. Perhaps the tallest folk I've ever seen. And about the same height too... are you brothers? Twins? Can drakon be twins? I thought they laid eggs, can you get twins from eggs? I always wanted twins, you know. Was hoping for a boy and a girl. Was going to name them Sol and Tris. Tris like Soltris, you see. And Sol like... well Soltris too, I suppose. I've always been very religious, you see, and I felt I should honor Soltris for all she did for me. I was a cleric of hers when I was younger Like Sol is now. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] proud of him! I plan on having him take his pilgrimage soon, you see. I've just about saved up for it. I met his father on mine. Everyone always assumes the pilgrimages are these boring trips down old dirt roads. But that's only if you *are* boring. They can be absolutely delightful. And I must recommend them even if you don't follow Soltris. She watches out for all travelers, no matter their faith. She's great like that. You should try praying to her. I do all the time, and it makes me feel great! But not as good as when I pray on the road. You are travelers, right? I haven't seen you around, so I assume you're not natives. I think I'd remember two shiny folks like yourselves. You are much shinier than the blue ones I met now that I think about it. I can just about see my reflection in you. Is that normal? Do you polish your own scales? What do you use to do that? My, now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME], you are missing quite a few scales, aren't you? What happened? Are you okay? I don't know any healing magic, I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Still, I can probably clobber old Anverth into making something for you if you're in any pain. Was it bandits? You should always inform the guard about bandits, particularly if you fought them and won. There are bounties, you see. You seem like you won- you're alive after all!""

The brothers stared at her and sniffed the air. They could faintly smell... burning.

""Oh no! my bread! I'll be right back to chat with you dears in just a moment. But I've got to go make sure the food doesn't burn. Toodles!""

The woman ran off into the kitchen, seemingly terribly excited about... well everything really.

Argus spoke. ""She seemed nice.""

Asgar nodded. ""I liked her.""

In a dense forest a beaten and tired orc rested. He had finally killed with the Greataxe. It had taken some time to find a solitary traveler, and he dared not fight a group in the state he was in.

As he lay against a tree, a voice spoke.

Your sitting at a fire with a what seems to be a young man,he seems to be around 20 years old but you know better he's much older then he let's on you have been traveling with him for a little bit now and yku never realized you don't know much about him so you decide to ask ""hey what's your story?""

Him ""what?""

""What's your story? I just realized I don't really know much besides that you have a horrible sense of humor"" 

""Oh humor me""

He gets a small laugh from you and you realized you fucked up and he says""looks like your humor is just a horrible as mine, that's funny""


""Anyways you want to know my story?





You nod

""I gotta warn you man it is extremely long and I may not finish it today or any day for a bit it's just that long"" 

You say"" yes I wanna h ar the whole thing"" 

""Ha okay  here goes nothing "" he says 


We switch to his POV 


It all started when I was around (..) at the time,

I was in highschool just living a good life with my two nerdy friends, I was a bit of a nerd myself but I was a nerd of fighting styles and I loved to learn all about it.

it was the beginning of the new school year and one day a new girl came I can't remember her name but she had blonde hair and blue eyes and a wild personality, me and her  quickly became friends because and her had a lot in common we both loved to fight but her way of fighting was using magic which I didn't even think was real at the time but seeing her use it opened a whole new world to me,

at some point we even dated for a little bit but we were better off as friends and I thought we were okay with just being friends.

after a year of being good friends I decided to get a girlfriend and as it turns out she didn't like it and what she did made me hate her very being, she burned down my house , killed my family and was trying to kill me too,I forget to mention but I was given these scissors thay can cut through reality and to a new dimension, anyways I ran to different dimensions untill i reached the final dimension I knew, it was at the end of the universe. 

i was deathly tired and i was not able to run,i realized i was going to have to fight,but soon realized I had no chance at winning so i was cornered near end of the universe, a black void and as i looked at her one last time she hits me with a spell causing a huge slash across my chest and i fall into the void screaming then nothing for what to be eternity.

suddenly  I wake up on a flower bed looking up to a whole in the cave roof, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] wearing your clothes but with a scar on my chest and my clothes destroyed, I was  younger then when i fell and i remember what happened,i was scared to move bit decided to get up and look around and i found a stick and decided to keep it for defence until i found a better weapon, 

I walked into a old hallway and then a monster in the darkness Comes out and looks at you, and I only seen them through the glowing eyes they had and I froze in fear feeling weaker then I already was but got ready to fight and it says"" a human?"" As it study's you and it begins to walk towards you and it comes into the light to reveal a tall goat monster wearing a purple dress with a strange symbol on the middle

""What are you"" I barely managed to say 

""Oh I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my child,my name is [REDACTED_NAME] and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] keeper of these ruins""

""Where am I?"" I asked the goat

"" Your in the ruins and it appears you fell through that hole in the surface""

""What hole I never fell through a hole"" you said in a nervous tone

"" Ah well it seems you hit your head also because that's the only way to come down here""  she said

""What do you remember my child?"" She asked 

""I was in a fight after running for so long and...""

You look at your body to see a grosome scar across your chest and your finally realizing that you were hit badly ,it was supposed to be a fresh injury why was it healed?

""I was hit badly and fell at the end of the universe""

""Universe? Ah tell more more at my home  I'll take you to my home and It'll feed you, you must be starving""

I was hungry so I agreed to go and as we were walking I felt someone looking at me and a quick look around you see a flower as it went around the corner 

You both continue walking until you reach a dummy and she says
""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to teach you something go up to the dummy""

I walk up to the dummy and yku look at it's eyes 

Suddenly a half yellow and half blue heart with a bright red circle in the middle comes in front of you,what seems to be a menu is also present 

(Attack) (Act)  (Items) (Spare)

(HP 1/1) ( Magic 100/100)  (Love:1) (exp 0/20 )

Name:unknown

Name unknown? I remember my name... what is it what's my name? Why can't I remember my name?

I need to think of something, and you thought of a font""sans"" 

""New name selected"" a voice says
""Sans is your name now"" the voice says
""What?"" You say 

Name Sans


Toriel grabs your shoulder gently and says"" your soul has three traits?""

""Wait what you can see this?"" You say 

""Yes I can as long as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you...but it's strange I have never seen this before a soul having three traits? And yku having 1 hp is completely absurd""

""How much ""HP"" are you supposed to have?"" You ask 

Toriel says "" for humans it's 20 HP and another thing is your magic humans are not supposed to have it the only time I have seen a human use magic is was when the great war happened but that was centuries ago ""

You ponder what she means for a second, your very confused and curious to what you can now do""

Chosen ""fight"" and two options come

 (physical)  (magic)

Chosen (magic) and

Nothing happens until you point your hand at the dummy for bones to come and stab the target,the force launches the dummy back into the wall destroying the dummy 

Your shocked at the damage you done and suddenly you feel insanely tired and you look at your menu yku see ""warning low magic"" 

Toriel looks at you absolutely shocked and confused and she catches you as you fall down from exhaustion and carries you back to the house because you passed out...

You Wake up to the smell of something delicious near a warm fire in a cosy home on a couch... it's comfy

Toriel walks into the room and sees you awake she sits down and asks if your are okay and you nod,she gives you a pie and you pretty much scarf it down due to hunger

""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you liked it my child, you looked pretty hungry"" 
You nod ferociously the pie was amazing 

You ask""what is this made of"" 


 ""cinnamon and snails"" she says 

You choke immediately and start coughing 

After a few minutes of you coughing you ask 
""snails??""  

""Yes snails"" she says casually 
""It's good right?""

You nod and slowly start eating again 


You finish the food pretty fast  because you were hungry


""Are you still tired?"" She asks and you nod she motions to you to follow and she takes you to a room where a bed a closet,toys in the corner and a pretty cosy looking bed in the far right of the room,you walk in,

she says
""Have a good sleep "" and closes the door you go on to the bed and lay down for a second then pass out..

Later that night.. you wake up to a lie beside the bed in a dark room you get up and touch the pie only for it to disappear ""new item in inventory"" that voice comes again,this time you hear the voice better and it's a female voice it doesn't sound like a robot or anything it sounds like a girl that's bored

1k6m3ae,1745478629,4/24/2025 7:10,confession,I work with the elderly. And I can’t bloody stand them.,"I work in a care home. Challenging behaviour, aggression, dementia, schizophrenia, health issues, bed bound, nursing, the lot. 80 plus residents, 4 units. I didn't realise until I worked in care how rude, arrogant, entitled, nasty, racist, homophobic some elderly are. Out of all 80 plus only about 8 are actually decent. They are so disgustingly rude it's unbelievable and this is even the ones who are non dementia. 

Dementia crowd are a different breed. Some of lovely, some are the most awful people I've ever met and before you guys go crazy and scream but it's their dementia!!!! Yes. Some of it. But there's still a human being under the dementia and there's no way calling one of my black colleagues a monkey, n***ga, wog and specifically attacking them for being black (or our Indian ladies) is new to them. That's been there for decades. One guy looked at one of our new african sponsorships and said ""get back on your banana boat and fuck off"" 

They treat us younger people literally like we are their maids, barking their every want at us when they can see we are busy. They hurt us, berate us, go out their way to make our job more difficult. One lady (non dementia) threw her dinner plate with her dinner on at me because I got her husbands sugar wrong in his tea.

I was targeted and attacked my entire pregnancy. Zimmer frame to the stomach, punched in the stomach, spat at, had a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher sprayed at me when I was heavily pregnant, told I should be ashamed of my mixed race baby. One new entry came in and only lasted 4 hours before his previous care home was called to take him back as he chased me saying he wanted to kill me and my baby. I've had shit thrown at me, my hair pulled, dirty nails dug into my skin and scratched. 

Another guy threatened to rape my younger colleague which really upset her. 

They're just vile. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and tired of saying we need to respect our elders and they're sweet little innocent cuties. There's some really nice ones sure! And I absolutely love doing care with them. But the others are just so nasty. 

Edit: just an add on.. in my experience schizophrenic people (medicated) are the sweetest people ever. We have a gentleman who is on injections each month and he's a HUGE guy. Big, muscly, 6 foot plus. He's in his 60s and he's so lovely and often tries to protect female staff from other male residents. Our schizophrenic ladies have their moments but generally are really kind and really intelligent too. ",19872,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So it’s more correct to say “I once befriended some unknown number of crows” 

I had originally wanted to train the local sparrows and robins to come when I sang, cause I thought that would be a really interesting party trick. 

Turns out crows are smarter than sparrows, so they cottoned on faster that if I made a certain call, they'd get food.

1dsqy11,1719834290,7/1/2024 11:44,stories,My husband is a human gas chamber.,"So, about 3 weeks ago I flew to South Korea for a vacation with friends who live there. My husband didn't want to go and said he'd be fine staying home and watching the house and dog. I trusted him because he's a 40 year old adult man and assumed he'd be able to feed himself like a sane person despite him possessing the cooking ability of a cactus. I was wrong. I should've dragged him and the dog along with me to another country.

What my husband decided to do during his 3 weeks without me was absurd. I would've been happier if he'd cheated on me instead. Because what he did was: order nothing but Taco Bell through DoorDash after he: somehow broke my stove by: cooking an entire 15lbs bag of red lentils all at once. Then he didn't bother to get a bowl for his lentils, he just ate them straight from the pot and stuffed the pot into the fridge and broke one of the shelves inside it. Now realizing his mistake, he decided to order nothing but terrible tacos for the remaining 2 weeks while getting high on medical marijuana. Also for some reason he bought a bunch of honeycombs from one of our friend's fathers and decided those made a good snack and has eaten nothing but beeswax and honey for the last few days because he's some kind of weird alien in a human disguise. Apparently honeycombs give you gas. And lentils give you gas. And *Taco Bell* gives you gas.

So now it's today and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] by what sounds like someone revving a motorcycle in my bedroom followed by the stench of the fiery pits of hell itself. It's 5:30 in the morning. He gets up and goes to use the toilet as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the windows in a poor attempt to ventilate the house but it's too late. He doesn't even have a solid poop, it's just 10 minutes of gas. Like 20 seconds of nonstop farts followed by a huge gasp of air and then another 20 seconds of gas. By this time, the dog has hidden under my couch because it doesn't know what those loud honking noises are and fears for its safety. I consider joining it, but continue to open every window in my house. It's 62 degrees out and windy. The wind just blows the fart smell around the house. My husband has left the bathroom and has walked upstairs. It sounds like there's a small 2-stroke engine in his pants. 

I can't take it anymore and scream that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to get breakfast at the diner and leave him. I bring the dog with me because the dog follows me out of the house because it also doesn't want to be here right now. So now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the diner waiting for my husband to de-gas himself while the dog sits underneath the table next to me wearing a pink leash-kid harness that my friends bought for *me* as a gag gift that has *my* name and ""Emotional Support Human"" on it that the waitress thought was some kind of in-joke. 

This is the start of my morning. I hope it's not as stinky as yours.",17517,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1c7c5cg,1713468495,4/18/2024 19:28,TrueOffMyChest,Therapy made me realize what an awful person I was to my ex and it cost me what could have been a happy marriage,"I finally broke down and decided to go to therapy despite my ex (we'll get more into him later) heavily suggesting it over the course of my relationship. I wanted to know why I was attracted to men that mistreated me so much but she dragged me down to earth with my most recent ex. She basically laid out what I did wrong, asked why I did what I did and described my actions as abusive and how I should approach the same situation going forward.

I met my ex through a friend. He was a couple of years older than me and he graduated in the early stages of our relationship. He was so caring (coming to stay with me in the library after work just to be with me), bringing me take out during stressful study periods and just being there.

In retrospect, I treated him like garbage. After being with so many bad exes (we have a cheater, some guys who lied about wanting a relationship with me just to get sex, etc.), I kind of compartmentalized my feelings and would often box out the offending party. With the first couple of arguments, I would box out my ex for a couple of days to cool off and he'd text a couple of times of me boxing him out to ask when I'd be ready to talk and we would and things would be fine.

I guess because he was so great, I unconsciously held him to a much higher standard. We were supposed to watch a movie together after my exam period but he went with his friends instead. He offered to go again with me and wouldn't spoil it nor give his opinions so it would be like we were watching it the first time and I boxed him out for five days. He would do his texting apologizing and I would lash out at him. I never took any accountability for my actions. It seemed like even the smallest thing that I perceived was ""wrong"" resulted in me boxing him out. It all came to a head when he said that my boxing him out was stressing him out and that if I was so unhappy, I was free to leave, he wasn't going to force me to change. I promised to change.

For a time, things did change. I went on an internship so the stress of studying and tests were gone and we had the best year of our relationship. We communicated at even the smallest things and he got even more romantic with me. Even the most trivial events (like simple grocery shopping) ended up being a great date and I was truly happy. We'd even discussed getting married when my career was stable and he got me a silver ring that was engraved with our initials and my graduation date for my left ring finger. He called it a placeholder for the real thing when the time was right.

Then I went back to school. The last year of school was so bad. My lab partners were just mean or lazy. The instructors were brutal and I struggled with the material. My ex tried to help but, as my therapist showed me, that I lash out more when stressed. He came over and did the dishes but forgot to wash the pans. I screamed at him and boxed him out for a week. I noticed a change because he only texted once during the boxing out period. In hindsight, I realized that he was preparing to leave. After the week was up, he brought up our previous discussion about me boxing him out. I was stressed and he didn't seem to care (my therapist said that he was likely beyond pissed) so I gave him lip service.

At this point during our session, my therapist was blunt and told me ""you are \*very\* lucky he didn't leave you then and there"". The straw that broke his back was my birthday. He'd been skimping and saving for the last 6 months or so (like we'd go to cheaper restaurants and he dialed back his nights out with his friends, like swapping bar nights to take out and video games) but I didn't think he'd skimp on my birthday. He took me to a cheaper place (instead of our usual steakhouse visit) and his gift was bath-bombs and a basket of my favorite snacks and chocolates. I was pissed and snapped at him that he could be frugal with himself or his friends but I thought I was more important. Time flew by and I'd boxed him out for two weeks. He did not text once. When I called to ask him to come over and talk all he said was ""I made the mistake of trying to change you. You should be with someone who will take you ask you are. I'm [REDACTED_NAME]"" and I fired back with ""well I won't wait for you to come back"". Lo and behold, he (and all his friends and family) blocked me the minute the call ended. Luckily the friend that introduced us did not block me so we could stay friends.

When I finished that part of the story, my therapist did not hold back. She told me that I need to work on my self-importance, be more reflective on my actions and how they impact other people, how to manage my disappointment better and communicate with him better (like ask why he was being so frugal). I've done that and I came to a horrible realization that I was awful to him. My therapist made me write all the things he did for me and a list of how he wronged me and got boxed out (along with the length of boxing out). The wrong part of the list was longer than the good part but the good parts seemed to outweigh the bad. Then my therapist asked if I had ever considered that I was getting mad about the small things and using my ex as a whipping boy for my disappointment and frustration. At first I thought she didn't understand and as I think more, it sinks in and I feel sick.

I guess my ex got his revenge. I met with the friend that introduced us (we're quite close) and I cried and vented about what I told my therapist and asked her if I appeared to be controlling and abusive. She was silent for a minute and said ""yes. He told us everything and the others all dislike you for what you did.""  
She was a little angry too and said ""well, you know why he was being frugal?"" It was his IG showing a brand new iPhone, AirPod Pros and a few video games with the caption ""was saving up for a ring but guess I don't need that anymore. Dodged a bullet and got an iPhone out of the deal!""

It really did hurt. If I listened to him and sought out therapy sooner, maybe I would be engaged to that wonderful man. Apparently he was planning to do it at the convocation.

I just don't know what to do now. I threw this all away. I asked my friend not to inform me of his life anymore. It just hurts to think that another girl will get to experience the happiness he brought me. I pissed away the lottery winnings because I didn't know how to control my temper.

I deserve this.

E: I want to thank everyone who commented and provided insight. Honestly, as I typed my responses, I realized how much my friend did for me, I should thank her for not leaving me at this trying time.

I *suspect* that my ex deliberately did not give her the instructions to cut me out nor force her to choose between us. I don't have a lot of friends (well, she's like my only friend left) and he probably didn't want me to be alone. I guess that was his one last act of kindness.

I wish I could go back in time and cherish that man. Sadly he's gone.

  
**Update**

Since there was so much support, I guess I owe you all an update. I reached out to my friend to grab dinner and chat so I could thank her for her support. 

We had a nice chat and she said what you guys said- she was happy that I was getting help. I read a lot of your responses and quite a few of you emphasized with my ex. Honestly, I never really thought about what he went through during my boxing out. I just knew it triggered his anxiety and he didn't like it. So I did a stupid thing and decided to ask her.

First, I asked how he was doing. She asked if I really wanted to know. I did. You all said that being boxed out for periods of time caused trauma, I just wanted to see if he was ok. She just showed me a group photo of them. I couldn't recognize him at all. He lost so much weight and looked fit. We were overweight while dating but he shed his cheek fat and more tight fitting clothes. Apparently, during the last box out, the guys got him a gym membership and he really dove in after leaving me and has been religiously going since.

I decided to ask about what I did to him. I told my friend that my therapist wants me to understand how my actions (in this case, my boxing out) affected him. What I heard made me feel even worse. Apparently, he started getting more apologetic over the smallest things (one example she gave was that he brought less food to a potluck than the others and started apologizing over and over). Then he started binge drinking sporadically. He told his friends that it was to ""cope with work stress"" but I really know (and they all know now) that we had been fighting. One night of binge drinking, one of the other guys was commenting how he had a minor squabble with his girlfriend over not liking The Notebook and that set my ex off. He had a full on mental breakdown and basically spilled out everything I had done to him at this point. 

That's when they turned on me. When I boxed him out, they would let him text me once and basically try to distract him while taking his phone away until he stopped trying to panic apologize. Then they started to tell him that he was being abused and to leave me. That was before the second time he asked me to change. They wanted him to leave me then but he insisted that I would change. Then the final time he agreed with them and gave them explicit instructions to block my number and delete my contact info when he gave the signal. However, he told my friend that she was free to do whatever she wanted. He said he wasn't going to kill a friendship over his problems.

Then he left and then the wall of silence came up.

I wish I'd never asked. I wish I thought about what he was going through. I had my head so far up my ass that I thought I was right and self-absorbed in my world where he was wrong and I was right and he deserved that punishment. 

Anyways, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] off now. I won't be using this account again. Thank you for all of your support and making me see the hard things. I'll continue with my therapy and hopefully find someone who treats me as well as my ex did.",1656,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A man on a bike rode past us, stopped, and then walked over to us. He asked us if we wanted to “see something.” We didn’t understand, but he then exposed himself to us.

We were just two little girls. I don’t remember everything we did Just running straight inside to her grandparents to tell them, the first time I really felt unsafe in the world for no reason at all.

1fdnhmz,1725989051,9/10/2024 17:24,TrueOffMyChest,I don't know what to feel or do. ,"First, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if my English is not good, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a non-English speaking country, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the English that I know and a translator. 

This story is recently but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to start with something of my past. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] male, but I feel more confortable with feminine gender. When I was 6 yo one of my cousins thought me ""a game"" if you know what I mean. I just don't want to remember what happened exactly is something that I tried so hard to forget, I just remember he used to take me apart from family reunions to my room when it was in my house or to his room if the reunion were in his family house, the rest you can imagine. 

That happened for a while. I don't remember how much but my mother found me crying one time after my family left my house and I just couldn't hold it anymore. My parents broke contact with his parents but they didn't do anything legal as I know.

Now my story. When I was 19, I had a group of friends, I was one of the olders of the group and we were like the parents of the group.. We planned the reunions (most of them just play videogames and watch movies or have a meet to eat something and talk), we were in charge of the youngers member and if there was a problem talked with their parents, things like that. 

One of the members was a girl of 15 yo, she like me is trans girl (in that moment still referenced herself as ""Him"") we were close friends, helped each other, play games, talk a lot about anime and things. Things like that. 

After some time, she started to talk to me more intimately, being romantic with me, even in front of her parents, I was really shy with those kinds of things, never had a partner, never even questioned me if I liked men or women, and I was still on my last year of school before university (I had to repeat 2 years of scholarship).

After a time of this, I just. accepted her intentions. we started dating, it was really similar to American romance movies, go to cinema, play games, kisses, hugs... that kind of things, her parents were okay with us dating, our friends never said anything, and I was lost in the moment.

We never had sex.. she asked me for that, and I just got red, each time that she asked me for that I couldn't even talk, just say ""I don't know"" or things like that.. After a week of she insisting me I accept, but in the moment that we went to a private room, and my mind understood that we're going to have intimacy. I started to cry, all the memories of my cousin went back to me and the only thing that I could say was ""I don't want to do this"". 

She insisted... she even started to take off her clothes and I asked crying to stop and try to open the door, until I finally left that room. She didn't tell me anything, didn't ask me what happened or anything, just stayed there and after 2 days she broke with me telling me that if I wasn't able to give her what she wanted, we couldn't date.

I was okay with that. we were friends from 8 years more, I went to therapy to try to help me, and she even helped me with that, we both together discovered that neither of us was men, we had works together, and we started to stream together. 

Our relationship broke when she became popular, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to deny that I was jealous, but I was happy for her, she eventually stops telling me and I felt like I was left behind, tried to talk with her again but it wasn't the same.

A mutual friend helped me a lot to face that, for me lose a friend, even more if is close to me it feels worse than death. But I understood that she wanted to have a new life, and I wasn't part of that, I only would like to hear it from her voice and not from another friend.

After a year, of that, in the present, there were rumors of her in internet, I don't know what kind, I just decided to keep my life and don't think any more on her, I even asked to mutual friends in discord that don't tell me about her because it still was hard to me to face that our friendship was over.

But suddenly she posted a cancelation talking about me.. She was guilting me about the rumors of her, telling things of me like I wasn't a good person and that... and in the end of that, she mentioned when we dated, she mentioned that she was minor aged.

When our romance happened, I didn't realize that I didn't think in that, nobody told me that what I was doing was wrong, even her parents knew, and they were okay.. I started crying, I felt that I did to someone else what my cousin did to, I felt like that shit..

My little community didn't say anything until I posted my answer, I admitted that it was true, that we had a romantic relationship but I deny that we had sex, I never explained what happened in the room, but I accepted the guilty of dating her, not for the rumors.

I lost everything, my fiance left me, I lost my job, friends, community, I receive hate in my dm's, in my channel, even this post I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it with another account to try to protect me, but I still am afraid.

I feel like the worst thing in the world, people are asking her to make this legal, but she don't want it because in her words I don't deserve her time, but I even want to go to jail.. I know that I did something bad, and I don't have any excuse, and the worst part is that I know this doesn't care to her, friends near to she told me that, she just used it to take me out of her life finally.

I don't know what to do, I started therapy once again, my psychologist tell me that I didn't anything bad if her parents and she were okay that happened, that we didn't had relations and that.. But I can't stop thinking that I deserve to go to jail and rot there...   
  
I just want to stop feeling like this, I even thought in go to police by myself and make me arrest for this o even kill me but I don't have the strong to do it...  ",1,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

q1ulm1,1633433991,10/5/2021 11:39,offmychest,"The words ""except for daddy... Huh?"" Will haunt me the rest of my life","I grew up in the predominant church in Utah... Yup... That one. One Sunday when I was 13-15 years old I was trying to get my mom out to the car after church (a time honored tradition). She was chatting with her good friend and some other women from the ""Ward""... Whatever it was they were talking about I heard one of them say something to the effect of; ""I don't care who you are you do not have the right to touch a child that way"" all the women nodded and the crowd mumbled in agreement. Off to the left of the crowd a young girl with long braids tugged at her mother's skirt and in a hushed tone said ""except for daddy... Huh?"" She was probably less than 10 at the time... The mother hushed her daughter and returned attention to the neighborhood gossip. I felt weird about that but was sure I took something out of context or misunderstood. Either way I wanted to get home and get out of my uncomfortable clothes and shoes as soon as possible.

Fast-forward several years... I left the church and started smoking pot. I got caught then tried to avoid paying my ""debt to society"" and was subsequently thrown in jail on a 30 day commitment (for paraphernalia... Yeah, I didn't even have any weed... I was put in jail for a dirty pipe). During the intake process, I was being escorted from one part of booking to the next when I see a familiar face... It was the longtime, squeaky clean, ward clerk. I thought that was odd... Surely it was a mistake... Maybe he is there for work (but he was cuffed)... Parking tickets... Something innocent, I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. 

I mention seeing this guy to my mother when I speak with her on the jail phone and she tells me dudes wife got up during fast and testimony meeting and explained that her husband has turned himself in for molesting (raping) his daughter from the time she was very young until she was a teenager. The police were altered when she had revealed the abuse to her bishop during the interview process to be married in the church's temple. I instantly remembered the interaction I witnessed at the church that day. Even now I can remember her look up to her mom for reassurance, that her dad was the exception to the arbitrary thing this neighbor was talking about.

I was the only person who had that perspective on the conversation in the church foyer that day. Her mother and I were potentially the only ones who could have helped her. I don't blame myself because I was young and I wasn't trained to look for stuff like that; but I would hope if I ever hear something like that again I would act. 

Later I learned from my younger brother that her younger brother (they were friends) had to walk the long way home from school... I wonder why... There were signs. She basically told me her dad was abusing her. Her mother obviously knew about the abuse. No one helped her. She endured for years after that. It breaks my heart. I wish I would have told someone what I heard. 

If you know someone is being abused, please help them. Don't stay silent. I could have potentially prevented years of sexual abuse but I didn't take it serious. It has stuck with me so on some level I knew it was serious but I was too self absorbed to help.

12h06t3,1681084068,4/9/2023 23:47,TrueOffMyChest,I Saw a Ghost and my Life is Ruined (Update),"I hadn't planned on updating. The original post got so little traction I didn't think there was much point. But someone requested it. I tried to post this earlier and it was removed. I don't know why. 

Assuming this works, for whatever it's worth, here it is.

Summary: I saw the ghost of my father about six months ago. The experience was terrifying, obtuse and confusing. The combination of feeling like no one believed me and having to re-think my entire view of the universe made me feel like my life was falling apart.

Where to start.

1. A couple of people suggested that I had just fallen asleep. But I don't think so. I have, at various times in my life, been so tired I've hallucinated, fallen asleep with my eyes open (and had dream that happened in the room I was staring at) and been so sick I was delirious. None of that felt like this. Dreams feel real when you're having them but seldom afterward. My experience was very clear and very lucid. I was sitting, I was reading, I remember what I was reading, there was no break in consciousness. And then my father's ghost appeared. And then he went away. Absolutely no indication that my state of mind was altered at any point.

2. Someone suggested CO monitors. I also didn't think it was likely that I had just enough CO in the apartment to cause a single hallucination but not enough to cause any other symptoms, but since it was an easy one to cross off the list, I got a couple. Nothing.

3. Some people questioned why I needed so badly to be believed. And wondered why I couldn't just accept it and move forward. And that's fair enough. But I kept thinking about the kids in the Narnia stories. They went to Narnia and were kings and queens there for decades before finding the door back and being teleported to the moment they left. So what do they do now? The rest of their lives, they either need to lie to anyone close to them or be thought insane. Imagine if you're dating someone and they sit you down and say, ""I have you tell you something. When I was nine years old I found a magic door in a dresser that lead to another world where my siblings and I fought a witch, saved a talking lion, and ruled as king for fifty years before being sent back in time to when I left. And it's important to me that you believe me.""

Maybe some of you would believe that. I suspect most people wouldn't. Imagine that was you. How isolating it would be. I know it's not exactly the same, but that's how I felt. This thing had happened to me, this thing that felt huge and powerful and central to who I was, and I couldn't TALK about it because any time I tried I was either believed-that-I-believed it or was told I was just dreaming. And the fact that it was my father I saw made it worse, because then my relationship with him became the story when it really wasn't.

Anyway. So then what happened?

I had a very hard few weeks after my first post. Still barely slept, barely ate. Hung up on by such a thread at work that my boss's boss gave me some ""bonus"" vacation so I could ""rest up"" after a recent successful project and ""come back fresh."" Which was (and is) humiliating, but survivable. I have a good relationship with my boss(es) and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] good at a job that's very hard to do well.

My fiancée was worried but supportive. She could see that I was under severe (and uncharacteristic) distress. I tried talking to her again. Tried explaining how much her lack of belief hurt me. How isolated and distant I felt as a result. How I needed her to believe me, to really, really believe me that I saw the ghost of my father. She gave me what she could. She asked me to tell her the story again. And then asked me a bunch of pointed questions about it. Not in a ""and how does that make you feel"" sort of way like a therapist. More like a police interrogation. Which sounds horrible, but honestly my fiancée is by far the smartest person I've ever met (and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] dummy) and having her sit down and focus and apply the full force of her considerable intellect to my story made me feel better all on its own.

At the end, she said ""Assuming you're remembering it all clearly, it doesn't sound like there's a simple explanation. It doesn't sound like anything else. I still don't know if I believe in ghosts in any real sense, but I do believe something very significant happened to you, and if you say it was a ghost then I have to accept that.""

Which wasn't what I was hoping for, but it was something. At the very least it opened the lines of communication between us so I talk about the difficulty I was having and why. And it gave her the opportunity to suggest that seeing a doctor was a good next step. Which I agreed to.

I did all I could to keep my increasing desperation away from my kids. I was mostly successful but they noticed. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] very positive and upbeat and very little bothers me for long. Seeing me so stressed and haggard and grim really worried them. I eventually told them I was having a problem sleeping (which was true enough). And my oldest (17F) said I should just get some sleeping pills. And we laughed. But then realized she was right.

Sleeping pills hadn't even occurred to me. I had been so focused on solving 'the problem' that I gave hardly a thought to treating the symptoms. So I talked to my GP got prescribed something and it made a world of difference. I was still struggling with feelings of isolation, still anxious and nervous all the time, still picking away at the memories like a scab, but my most immediate problem was that it had been three months since I'd slept more than two hours at a stretch and I was at the raggedy edge of my physical, mental, and emotional resources. After a few days' real sleep I was no longer feeling like I was at the very edge of drowning every second of every day. Nothing was fixed at this point, but I found I could mostly make it through the day without looking like I was dying.

And I went to see a neurologist. My father's side of the family has some history of early-onset Alzeimer's so it was easy enough to get a referral. The original appointment was nine months out but I called every Monday around the same time and politely asked about cancellations (""I'll take anything, even on short notice""). And sure enough after about a month of this I got a call asking if I could be there in an hour. I told them I could (if there's one universal, ironclad rule for living it's this: always be nice to receptionists).

And I got a full neurological work-up. During the course of the exam I told the doctor I'd had one ""hallucination"" and I told him the story. The exam did not turn up anything concerning or unusual. I asked the doctor about my ""hallucination"" (and admitted that's really why I was there). And he said, quite calmly ""Well have you considered the possibility that you actually saw a ghost?"" Which completely rocked me back. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] easily made speechless, but that did it.

He said, ""I've been doing this for 35 years and usually when someone complains about hallucinations it's because their great-aunt Phyllis appeared to them in a dream and told them to blow up a community centre or they're noticing that the government is sending them coded messages in their alphabet soup. And so we deal with that. But sometimes someone like you comes in who's otherwise healthy and in command of their faculties, and a very strange thing happened to them. And they, like you, jump to the conclusion that something is wrong with them. But I think some of the time, probably whatever they think happened to them has just actually happened to them.""

And I just broke. I broke. Almost six months of stress and anxiety and terror and holding everything in and not giving myself even the tiniest bit of slack to loosen up and I just broke. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] usually a crying person but I sat in that nice old doctor's nice old office and I put my face in my hands and I wept for what felt like hours.

The nice old doctor gave me some tissue and waiting until I started getting hold of myself. And he said, ""The world is wide. Maybe understanding everything is not only impossible, but undesirable. Sometimes the greatest gift we can give ourselves is learning to live in mystery.""

Which wasn't exactly revolutionary advice, but his casual, off-hand acceptance that I did see a ghost felt like having an infected boil lanced. The event, and the pain and confusion it caused, was all still there, but all of the horrid painful beating pulsing hot ragged suffering has bled out of it.

After that, I found that I was able to accept, and tale comfort from,  my fiancée's care and concern. I found that was able to hear (and access) my therapist's empathy and advice. I found I was able to take her advice and consider the event in terms of what I needed from people and figure out how to ask for it without everything just spiraling down into the howling frustration of being utterly alone.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] wrestling over what it all means (if anything) and what I do about it (if anything).

Sleep is still harder to find, and bad dreams often close by whenever I do. And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] very anxious and jumpy in the dark, or when I feel a cold draft, or smell roses.

But I seem to be on the mend.

I doubt I'll do any more updates on this. Thank you to all those who tried to help.",28,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fwgvet,1586248186,4/7/2020 8:29,stories,A friend died a few years ago... Here's our story.,"Content warming: This post contains talk of Suicide, death and divorce, so if that's not your thing, click away please.   


(Hopefully this doesn't count as a wall of text, it's just all I could think was important to the story, and being a true story everything comes back to a certain moment)

It's been over 5 years now since I lost a close friend, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure where else to tell the story, but I've been wanting to for some time now.   
\----------------------------------------------------

When I was in highschool my parents divorced, my step father kept his house, and my mother along with me and my brother moved out. We found an apartment in a new city, but our lives had changed quite a bit. New school, new home, and biggest of all new friends. It was a big change for me, but I saw it as a chance for a new life. I was never the most popular person but this was my chance to change things!  


 I signed up for the School's Theatre program as part of my starting classes and fell in love right away. Everyone seemed so nice, and I loved being able to do something relating to acting. I'd wanted to do acting and singing since I was a young kid, and this was my chance! So, I signed up for a play... It was our school's rendition of Addams Family and to my shock... I got a pretty big roll, being the understudy of one of the main cast, getting 2-3 shows of my own. I was thrilled, so I did everything I could relating to theatre. This included going to a special showing my town was doing of Les  Misérables. I wasn't familiar with it, so I opted to go.  


As I was signing up to go see the show(I believe it was extra credit as well) A girl approached me, asking if she could have a ride home after the show, since her family didn't have a ride. I said I'd call my mother and see what we could do, I asked for her number and name, We'll call her Winona and  we were off. Little did I know that would be the single biggest decision I'd make in my entire life.

We showed up early to be first in line and with hours to kill so she decided to teach me a card game she was fond of, Muchkins I believe it was called, and we played that, sang karaoke and did all kind of goofy things for the 2-3 hours it took for them to open the doors to everyone. I remember her telling me about her long distance boyfriend who she was having some issues with, and all about some minor personal things in her life. We chatted sharing stories before the doors opened and she introduced me to a friend of hers, we'll call the friend Meghan, and we were off to the seats.  


Winona sat on one side of me, Meghan on the other and the show began. I was rather impressed by the whole thing kind of locked in before I felt someone grab my hand... Winona for some reason was holding my hand. I can't explain to you how awkward I felt, knowing 1, she had a boyfriend and 2, that I had known her for all of 2 hours. But I didn't tell her, I just let her hold my hand until she eventually pulled it away, and told her friend it was her turn. It was some joke, and I played along with it which she was so excited to see that I did. She was very excited that night. She saw a play with a fairly famous internet personality in it, she met a new person, and she even caught pieces of paper that a main character tears up and tosses into the audience. It was incredible. When it was over we took a picture with everyone, and my mother and I took her home.   


Winona, me, and Meghan formed a fairly close friendship over the next year, countless inside jokes, and fun things done together. Me and Meghan even had a short lived romantic thing, broke it off and stayed friends. It was really a unique kind of friendship given I was the guy who did a lot of these ""feminine"" things with them. They did my makeup, went to costume parties, did all kind of goofy things, and just had a good time...  


I remember Winona's birthday like it was yesterday... Meghan had made Winona a birthday snack, but she was so late for school we didn't get to enjoy her there. I still save the messages asking where she was at the time. She said her bus was late and would be there soon. With hindsight, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] so sure what to think.  


3 months later and Winona was looking different at school... Distant, but I just assumed it was a bad day at school, and that it'd be better once the weekend had passed. It haunts me every single day knowing I didn't say anything to her. I saw her... I knew she was distressed or upset or something and I chose not to say anything. She walked away from the friend group, me and her boyfriend were the only ones there, we both thought it seemed strange, but didn't really convey that. I went home, thought nothing of it, excited for the weekend and assumed it'd be all dandy the next few days.  


I woke up late saturday night, probably around 8pm to a voicemail. I'd stayed up the night before playing video games, or watching youtube, something to pass the time. I never even bothered checking my messages the night before. So when I woke up to a voice mail on Saturday it was strange. No one ever called me so I felt some weird ominousness from it.   
I listened to it groggily only to be met with Meghan's voice.   
""Hey \*REAL NAME\* it's Meghan, call me back when you get this. Um... She- Winona's dead... She killed herself yesterday, and I felt it was rude to tell you over text... So, I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Call me back, bye."" 

I was in a bit of shock. I couldn't believe it. I wasn't sad, and Meghan's voice sounded so normal... It was a bad joke. That's all... Right? I tried to believe that.   


Sunday passed and the news hadn't really hit me. I played Halo, and just went on as normal, sure it wasn't real. Then I got a message about wearing black to school, and a friend was making ribbons. Still... It wasn't real. It couldn't be real.   


I showed up in black, half to humor it and half to keep up my own lie. I'd play along, and when she jumped out I'd say how I knew it was a prank, and that it was a good one.   


Instead I was met with somber faces of everyone who knew her standing around outside the school waiting for me... Black outfits, and messy hair... It seemed 15+ people were there, from theatre people, old friends who'd grown distant, just about everyone who had a relationship with her.   


I got my ribbon.  
A thin purple strip of fabric, Her favorite color. Then we all got called into the crying room. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure what this room is technically called, I believe it was a room they held meetings in, a long table with about 20 chairs. But we weren't there for that... We were supposed to be here to talk about Winona. Share stories, just do stuff to take our mind off of having to be at school so we could remember her. I felt a weight in my chest that I hadn't before... Everyone looked as shocked as I was... Then the announcements came on over the speakers. Normal, every day school news, followed by a moment of silence for Winona. Half of the heads in the room hit the table at the same time, including mine. everyone realizing it was real was horrifying. The sound of sobs was haunting... I could feel everyone trying to comfort everyone while having no idea how.  


I left school early that day. I walked to the office and said I was leaving, they just let me go, saying sorry.   
As I left I kept looking back hoping to see her jump out saying that it was all just a dark joke.  
I walked down a mile or two to a local place where we used to hang out and just cried. I cried and cried. A server who recognized me sat there too, trying go comfort me, but I don't think I could.   


My mother picked me up and I cried the whole way home. I cried even more at home. I spent hours just scrolling through old facebook photos, our time during the show, our time doing 1 shots, her old singing videos. The entire time my mother just held me tight, I feel so thankful for her being there... I cried until tears just couldn't come anymore, then I screamed... I didn't recover for a while... The next few weeks are a blur... I couldn't taste food, I didn't want to eat, I just remember feeling so empty and sad... Eventually the sadness went away and I was left just empty for a while. I'd occasionally see someone on the street who looked vaguely like her, or peak around a corner to see if she was there, always met with disappointment. Through the process me and Meghan got back together for another few months, probably out of grief and wanting something to comfort us more than anything. I think that helped a lot for a while. I was learning to smile again, and on the right track. Me and Meghan broke up and life went on. All kind of things went on. But I can't forget her.   


5 years later I still find myself occasionally hoping to see her, even after her vigil, and seeing her urn. Part of me still hates accepting that she's gone. Seeing everything to do with her is bittersweet... 

And recently my old facebook was deleted so I don't even have our old messages. I keep that phone though, and the voicemail. I have both backed up multiple times.  


I still write to her a lot. I use the description of the voice mail saving almost as a diary to write about whenever I think of her.   
I hate that she can't see what's happened to all of us, I hate that she never got to do her dream role... I hate that she's never seen me after I came out, I hate that I never told her how much she mattered, or even gave her one last hug. I hate that she died older than me, and now she's stuck at 17 while I grow older.   


I can't remember my last words to her, and I don't know why it breaks my heart so much.  As awkward as it was the first time, I wish I could just hold her hand again and tell her how much she means to me.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway that's my story I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my secondary account because I don't want my real account flooded with anything, nor do I want karma or anything from this.   


I just wanted to tell our story, especially since I thought about her a lot tonight.  
And to let anyone know that if you're not doing great, I'd be happy to talk to you. I'd hate being able to do something and not for the second time. Please, if you're considering anything like this, give me a message and I'll try to get back to everyone.",85,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17gcc24,1698260611,10/25/2023 19:03,stories,My younger brother is going through the same thing I went through and I don't have any empathy for him.,"My little brother is going through the same thing I went through and I don't have any empathy for him.

Do you know what it feels like to feel like shit? Feeling... a failure, not knowing what to do with your life? Well, that's what my little brother is going through right now.

We are a family of 6 people (my parents, my older sister, my older brother, my younger brother and me). Me (22 years old)... I am [REDACTED_NAME] one in the middle, and yes, I am [REDACTED_NAME] one who has received the least attention, but it is not something that I blame my parents, it is something that I understand. I understand that my parents were busy working so that my siblings and I had everything we wanted. For this I don't feel any kind of resentment. What's more, I don't feel anything anymore.

For you to understand, I need to go deeper into my story. Primary school was one of the most difficult stages. As a child he thought that people did what they did in order to be happy. As an adult I feel that for you to be happy, someone has to suffer. He was a naive child, I didn't realize that they were bullying me until 5th grade (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to tell what they did to me because I don't want to remember it). When I entered high school I thought that things were going to change and they did, at least a few months were calm, but that hope I had of believing that everything would not be the same again faded a few months later. Thanks to these events my grades went down, I was about to repeat the year three times in different years. I currently owe subjects because I couldn't finish studying. Three months before I finished high school I stopped going because I couldn't take that humiliation anymore.
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] angry with them, they must have had their reasons for doing what they did, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with myself, for not defending myself, for not having had a little pride.

Due to homework I couldn't start studying what I dreamed of being when I grew up. A year after leaving high school I wanted to take those subjects, but since it was a pandemic year I couldn't. The following year I couldn't either because there were no teachers who could take the exam for me. At that precise moment I gave up, I went into depression, but it wasn't like the depression I felt when I was being bullied, it was different, and by being different I was able to get out of it on my own, I didn't need anyone's help.
If you ask me if it was difficult to face that alone, it was very difficult. More remembering the moments that I thought would be the best of my life, they were truly hell.

After a year and a half feeling like a failure, like a shitty person, and seeing how my brothers fulfilled their dreams and I didn't, I wanted to try again. I am [REDACTED_NAME] exercising, I am [REDACTED_NAME] to change my physique to feel good about myself at least, I am [REDACTED_NAME] taking those subjects that I should little by little, I am [REDACTED_NAME] and I feel moderately good. I think finding out I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to be an uncle helped a little with my mental change.

Well... Being so focused on myself, I didn't realize what was happening at home, two months ago I found out that my older brother is in his depressive stage. And he makes me a little angry. He is constantly saying that he wants to give up his life, that he doesn't want to be here anymore. My sister, in addition to being pregnant, has relationship problems and is stressed trying to help my dad. My parents are in their separation stage and I just found out that my younger brother is in the same stage that I went through.

I don't know if I'm [REDACTED_NAME], but instead of feeling empathy for them and wanting to help with something at least. I don't feel anything, in fact I want to get away, I want to go to another country. I want to search for the dream that I should have searched for a long time ago. I wanted to test if the lack of empathy and emotions that I lack are only with my family, but it happens with everyone.
I don't want to go to a psychologist, I've already been to many and they didn't help me during my worst stage.",1,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1g34ly0,1728867978,10/14/2024 1:06,self,Never realized how lonely I was until I received the smallest amount of attention.,"In day to day life I'm [REDACTED_NAME] invisible, sometimes probably just a bother. Often get told things like ""didn't even realize you were here,"" or ""were you there that time when..?"" Yeah, I was, maybe, doesn't even matter. I have more conversations in my head with people than I do out loud, sometimes even confusing the two in my memories.

But recently, someone treated me pretty nicely, it was completely platonic but I couldn't help but develop a crush. I know it's going nowhere, I genuinely wish for a lobotomy or some procedure that stops me from feeling emotions. 

I thought I didn't need or want anyone, after asking out my friend of six years (who had already agreed we should get married by age 30 if both still single), and she rejected me. Telling me she lost feelings.. I just thought maybe someone could actually love me for me at that moment, not for my potential, or a future where they are so desperate I'm [REDACTED_NAME] last option, it was dumb to think that. So I closed myself off to that possibility in my mind.

And yet I still developed a new stupid crush I don't want, don't need, fucking over my attention that needs to be on important things. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] busy than ever but I've never felt more lonely. ",2472,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1ingu1b,1739328206,2/12/2025 2:43,TrueOffMyChest,I had an allergic reaction and it led to being called psychotic and raped,"First, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to acknowledge that my story will sound so fake but it isn't. This really happened to me.

I ate a weird spice one night by accident at my boyfriend's dad's house. I thought it was pepper. But it wasn't. I never had an allergic reaction before. I just thought my throat was burning because it was spicy. I never ate spice before. So, I didn't even know that spice shouldn't feel so terrible. I ignored it because my boyfriend didn't seem concerned.

A few days later, my face was very stuffed and felt swollen. The doctor gave me flu medication. It didn't help. 2 days later I started hyperventilating. I went back to the doctor's one week after I went the first time. They gave me prednisone and steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler. I got better for a few hours from the prednisone, but I ended up hyperventilating again.

I went back to the doctor's. They gave me a chest x-ray. They said they found nothing on the x-ray and said I just had post nasal drip from the flu. Mind you, I literally talked with the doctors for 5 minutes nonstop and she could HEAR and SEE me struggling to talk and breathe. 

I ended up going to an ENT because I felt like my ears and throat were a problem. 
The ENT couldn't even put his endoscope up my nose because my nose was so swollen and infected. He gave an antibiotic and ordered a CT scan and an allergy medication (L). I also told him that my face felt like it was melting and I am [REDACTED_NAME] heart problems. His response? I'm [REDACTED_NAME] ears, nose, and throats doctor ONLY... go see a heart doctor. 

Within a few days, I ended up at the ER. I was severely hyperventilating and my face felt so messed up and my heart was pounding. At this point, I was taking Nyquil and the antibiotic and the steroid nasal spray and the steroid inhaler and the steroid pill, prednisone. The ER wrote in my medical records ""allergic reaction to prednisone"". He never said that to us in person. He even said to take the remaining prednisone. He advised and wrote on my packet ""do not take sudafed"" and (despite my boyfriend saying that i do not have any history of anxiety) gave me anxiety medication. He also talked about other patients in front of my ER room because it was across from all the computers. I could see the MRIs from my room.

I was released. A little over 12 hours later, I went back to the ER. At this point, I had severe tingling in my face and it was burning and I was becoming disoriented. The doctor just brushed me and prescribed me Sudafed. We showed the nurse that the other ER doctor said no sudafed. But we were told that it would be fine.

I took sudafed. It caused severe disorientation and a bunch of other symptoms. So, I went to the ER again. Okay, I probably sounded crazy because I could only describe my symptoms by saying that I had sepsis. Not that I necessarily believed that I had sepsis. There was a severe misunderstanding and I was so messes up from the medication that I could not communicate effectively. I also repeated things that the first ER doctor talked about outside of room.... so I definitely sounded crazy... but like I said, my communication level was very messed up. This visit just ended up threatening to baker act me.

Baker act is basically forcing you to go to a mental institute.

But once again, I was not told to stop taking any medication.

The next day was extremely rough. I was screaming about how my face felt like it was melting and my nerves in my face were disconnecting and my insides felt like they were rotting from the inside out. My boyfriend called the pharmacist. The pharmacist said that if this was atypical behavior and it started after medication then I was stoned and he recommended to take me off medication and to bring me to a health clinic.

The next morning I was brought to a health clinic. But instead of talking to a doctor, I talked with a psychologist. My boyfriend said I could talk about anything. So, me being me.... I talked about how I fell down when I was 12 and the issues that I had. Because that's what was on my mind at the moment with my leg hurting. Then I started talking about my breathing problems but also repeated what the first ER doctor said about the other patients. My boyfriend told the psychologist that I was talking about what the ER doctor said but ignored him.

Then I was brought into the x-ray room. They didn't have x-ray technician. Instead a nurse gave me my x-ray. She told me the wrong positions. Mind you, it was all but 2 weeks ago I had an x-ray done and had to do it twice due to my skirt's zipping ruining the first set of x-rays. This nurse gave me all the wrong positions. So I told the nurse that it was done wrong. Then she asked me to demonstrate. I demonstrated. Then afterwards, she said that she can't do the x-ray again. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I'm [REDACTED_NAME] leaving until you do it again. So we had a big argument. The police were called because I wouldn't leave the room. Then police got there, talked with me, were super fricken confused by the entire situation. They were like whatever. But the nurses had me baker acted. 

So I went to a mental institute. Again, I told them that I was in a lot of (physical) pain. And once again, I was ignored. I told them the turn of events that I've experienced. And then my boyfriend comes in. The psychologist lady started basically saying that I was crazy and my boyfriend entertained the idea. I told my boyfriend to stop and I don't belong here and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] real, physical pain.

Then I was left in a room by myself for a long while. Then eventually was told that I had to stay. I was brought into a unit. I got a drink. The first person I met was someone who shared my first name. I kid you very not. Can you imagine how that made me feel in the moment? Maybe I really was crazy. (But it was true! Just like everything else!)

I went to lay down in my bed. But once again, I was in significant pain. I started screaming and screaming. The nurse ran over and continuously said ""You're not in pain""... which made me scream louder. Then I screamed to call my boyfriend. And then instead, they called a bunch of nurses and sedated me.

And the next thing I woke up to was being assaulted. I'll skip those details. I remember so vividly the nurse giving my sweater to clean myself off with and then me dropping the sweater on my shoes.... and the nurse helping me pull up my underwear... 

I refused medication other than my antibiotic. After a day and a half, I started feeling better and I started remembering that something bad happened to me. The psychologist brought me into a room. I said I want a lawyer.

I was brought into a different room. This lady said that I had to take the medication or else I wouldn't be able to get a lawyer.

So I started taking it.... and I started feeling very messed up again. I stayed for 2 weeks.... being drugged up... and I was forced into an put patient program and was forced into taking more drugs and more drugs. I kept having severe side effects from medications... so they just kept me on the same medications and gave me more medication for the side effects. 

Then I found out that I was 8 weeks pregnant a month after I was admitted initially to the mental institute. I was so drugged up. All I could say was that something bad happened to me to my boyfriend. He looked up the medications... and the problems that occur to fetuses were not good. I ended up having an abortion. 

I... can't describe the terror.

I continued to take the medication after the outpatient program for about 2-3 weeks. My boyfriend was very pissed off. He said the doctors said that I was psychotic and I needed the medication for a year plus minimum or for a lifetime.

I tried telling him over and over and over that it was the medication, not because I was psychotic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!

I eventually went through the timeline with him, describing everything with him. He finally recognized that it was very fishy. 

He went to see a therapist. We were arguing about me being off medication and how I wasn't going to go see a therapist or psychologist or how I wasn't going to pick up new medication ""just in case"". He talked to his therapist. His therapist said ""Let her, she's an adult.""

I cannot... I cannot express my gratitude.... I can't express the terror I went through.... I cannot express my gratitude to someone I never met to finally listen to what I was saying.

And then I was off of them officially. There was no argument anymore. And guess what? My heart rate went back to normal. My face pain slowly subsided. My brain stopped being all fogged up. I started being able to focus and not move like a slug. I regained my strength where I could finally open my Gatorade bottles again. Most of all, I felt relief and a return to normalcy.

And then... slowly the emotions of what happened to me really hit me. I started having panic attacks because the memories started coming. Slowly my memory started coming in more and more and more. And then I remembered that I was raped. And the series of events that happened afterwards and talking to my boyfriend. Oh how messed up... how painful.

I tried to get a lawyer. But the malpractice lawyer says that I have to talk to a criminal attorney. The criminal attorney says that I have to get a civil attorney. No one is willing to accept my case.

It's been over a year and a couple of months since.

I have to get this off my chest. My boyfriend is amazing. I love him so dearly. He really is a great, cuddly, loving boyfriend. Did he call me every day while I was in the mental institute? Yes. He visited me twice too. But.... but.... the problem is... he didn't believe me when I needed him to. He didn't stand up for me when I needed him to. He believes me now. He's stood up for me since.

I started having allergic reactions that led into anaphylaxis... aka I started hyperventilating again...this past summer. I went to a different medical group about it. I was hyperventilating, very noticeably. My boyfriend and I signed up like 2 months prior to the same doctor. He ironically had an appointment the same day. So, she saw the both of us.... him for his lab results and me for hyperventilating. 

The first thing she said was that I was having a panic attack. My boyfriend said she is having an allergic reaction, not a panic attack. She said ""Fine, I will give her a high dosage of something like benadryl. If she doesn't get better in 15 minutes then she's having a panic attack."" She gives me the shot and... guess what, I got better within 15 minutes. Point proven.

POINT PROVEN!!!!! 

POINT PROVEN!!!!!! 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I took the next day off because I was so fricken passed out. I went the next day. But I started hyperventilating again. I called my doctor again. She gave me an asthma medication. It helped a lot. 

A few weeks later, I thought I had like a sinus type of infection. She prescribed me the same antibiotics as the ENT months and months beforehand, before I was admitted to the ER. I ended up having a fast heart rate and other weird side effects. I told my doctor and she switched antibiotics. I felt way better after that. But I made an appointment to see her because she said she wouldn't prescribe more without seeing me.

Then she said I likely have asthma and my allergic reaction are being caused from asthma. She prescribed me an allergy medication (L), which the ENT also had prescribed me month and months prior and a nasal spray.

My face within a day of taking (L) medication started burning. I called my doctor and told her. She said stop taking it but use the nasal spray. This was a Friday. I made an appointment on Monday. She couldn't make it. I talked with an doctor (a man) who was basically dismissive and rude. My boyfriend stood up for me then too and acknowledged the male doctor was just stupid.

My doctor called me the next day. I told her that my face was still burning. She said okay stop taking all medication, switch to Allegra only, and use a nasal rinse 3 times a day for the next 3 days and then go down to 2 per day. She has also made me stay on the asthma medication after I got better. 

And it worked.

I haven't had any face burning... or hyperventilating. Whenever I eat something that burns my throat (like I drank a sip from a German beer or another time from an Indian dish, for examples), I immediately take Allegra / benadryl and my asthma medication, and I end up okay.

Point proven... I was not psychotic. I had severe side effects from medication. I lacked communication. I was raped. I was drugged to forget about the rape. I was used as an insurance piggy. I was ignored. I was mistreated. I was made me to feel crazy. And all I had was an allergic reaction that could've been simply resolved.

And you know what... after everything. I love my boyfriend so much. He's been my rock since. He's realized his mistakes. We are about to celebrate Valentine's Day. But you know? I can't see him or feel for him the same way I used to.... he believed the doctors over me when I needed him the most to believe me and listen to me and care for me... I feel absolutely terrible... I think he knows.... I'm [REDACTED_NAME] darn sure he knows. He's trying so hard to make up for it. I wish I could just go back to feeling how I felt before... but I just can't.

Here’s my story.,"EDIT: I have had a lot of folks claiming that I am a troll and haven't actually been through this experience. I can assure you that I have. This is a new account as I have been through the classic ""binge/purge"" cycle with my reddit accounts. Here is an old post from a deleted account that details everything there is to know about my history with my gender:

Posted this to other subs but wanted to get it here as well because when I was at my most confused was when I was being affirmed blindly and told that my experiences meant I was trans. I think we need to do better to unpack people’s psychology to better understand root causes of these types of emotions and feelings.

Trans people exist. They are valid. But not every person that questions their gender is trans. And that is ok.

I have come out on the other side of a long questioning process feeling very solid about my masculinity. My compulsive behaviors that took hold of me via a cocktail of some likely innate feelings, my childhood trauma, and my natural curiosity send me spiraling down a rabbit hole that created significant distress in my life.

That said, I’m thankful for the experience. I’ve learned a lot about myself and feel happier and healthier than I have ever felt before.

I am a man, early 30’s. Since young adolescence, I became drawn to fiction and media that featured gender bending themes. I never understood why I felt drawn to these themes but used them to fantasize for my entire life.

Last year, I decided to look into things more seriously and semi-concluded that I was just a transsexual. But I still didn’t understand why I felt that way - I was just being driven by my impulsive desires.

When I stumbled upon Carl Jung’s theories of Self, I became very intrigued. Especially at the idea that all people have masculine and feminine within them. As I dug further into my past and my own psyche, I could see patterns emerging. A difficult relationship with my mother (who was not very effeminate herself). Being taught my inner feminine emotions were considered weak. Dealing with rejection from girls.

A void of femininity.

The human brain does not like voids. We tend to fill in that space when they arise. I think this is what happened with me. My subconscious feminine energy was still there, but because it had been so internally (and externally) repressed. I created an inner feminine ideal and “fell in love” with it. I used gender bending themes and fantasies of being female to fill that void.

And once momentum starts with something like that, it tends to continue, even as that void is filled with things like marriage. It’s taken me until now to face these things and come back out of the pit I was in to realize I enjoy being masculine and have no desire to transition. I owe a lot of that to Jung’s theories.

14n3u4r,1688139592,6/30/2023 15:39,TrueOffMyChest,I was kidnapped by my childhood best friend and her mom without realizing it.,"My mom suggested I could share my story to raise awareness but the truth is that if it wasn't for her I probably wouldn't have even seen it as kidnapping. If you expect a dramatic story filled with abuse and torture I have to disappoint you. I think its not a bad idea to share my story and since I love reddit I decided to share it here. I figured that this subreddit might be the best one to do so. Using a throwaway for this as I only want to raise awareness for this without going further into it and having my main account associated with this story.

But lets get to the story. This happened when I was in elementary school. Like for most children at that age boys and girls were somehow rivals. Me and my best friend, lets call her Lisa (fake name) however singlehandedly destroyed that stereotype. She was pretty much the exact female copy of me. Our interests aligned so well that we quickly became best friends. The day it happened I asked my mom to stay at Lisa's house for the night.

She said yes and I packed the stuff I needed. I was only prepared to stay there for one night. But one night turned into a week. When I arrived there we had a great time playing video games, doing roleplay with our toys and playing hide and seek at night. It was much fun. The next morning I prepared for my mom to get me but this was when Lisa's mom told me that my mom had called her and told her that I had to stay at their house for a bit longer. Being the naive young child I was I didn't question it. Yes I was confused but this only made me realize that I could spent more time with Lisa so for me it wasn't a problem.

This was at a time where I didn't possess a smartphone so its not like my mom could've just call me. I stayed there for an entire week before I started to question why my mom hasn't got me yet. I wasn't allowed to leave the house either. I was only allowed in the house and the garden outside. When me and Lisa played outside a neighbour saw me and called the cops. It turned out that my mom filed a missing report at the police station because I was missing for a few days.

It turned out that my mom had actually tried to get me after the first night. But when she tried to Lisa's mom told her that I already left and that apparently I told her I wanted to walk home when she offered me to give me a ride. Lisa's mom was such a sweet person that no one would've ever suspected her of doing something like this so even my mom figured that someone had to kidnap me on my way home so she filed the report.

The police reunited me with my mom and I was confused as hell. I had a great time there. Yes I was a bit worried why my mom never got me but I couldn't understand back then why Lisa's mom was arrested. This happened during summerbreak and I didn't see Lisa during the summerbreak. And she also didn't appear at school on the first day. I have no idea what happened to her. Right now I assume that this incident ruined their reputation so much that they moved away and I never saw Lisa again.

Like I said its not a typical kidnapping story. It all was so sneaky that not even I as the alleged victim could tell that it was one but my mom insists that it was a kidnapping. So yeah thats it. I still don't know if labeling myself as a victim here would be right because I just don't feel like one. But thats just me.

EDIT: Want to clarify something. I was a child with the attention span of a fly and tell this story based on what I remember and what my mom told me. I assume that if my mom told the police the same thing Lisa's mom told her the police maybe didn't focus that much on Lisa's mom and if they did they might have just taken a witness statement of her at the door and then its not far fetched I didn't notice it. Especially since I was at Lisa's room most of the time and was focused on the games we played. This is also why I didn't notice when my mom tried to get me after the first night.

Just wanted to clarify this because some people call my story fake because the police wasn't investigating Lisa's house from what I could remember.",8125,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello Reddit, today i'd like to share with all of you a story, one about myself, and the realizations i have had in the past month. However I believe with my story it is best to start at the beginning or close to. I was a smart kid, very interested in everything I could grasp onto an understanding of, I am [REDACTED_NAME] gonna lie and say I was some genius kid. I was a mostly normal kid with severe insomnia and a bad home life, and from a very young age, around 8 or 9 I desired to die. As time went on i started contemplating the afterlife, and creating and desired so badly to understand it i thought about it and suicide all day long, through school, at home, when watching tv, when doing anything. The thoughts of suicide and the afterlife filled my head. As I get older I accept afterlife or not. I don't fear death, but I believe all my time learning and attempting to come to a comprehensive understanding of the world leads me down a path where I feel a great disconnect with fellow humans.

As I grew older and older I feel I started losing it a bit, I'd stay up all night learning new things or taking things apart, attempting to understand more and more of the world. I'd come out of every long late night with something new. However i also lost my mind from time to time, i remember when i was 14 (2015) probably, i had stayed up all night looking at the way that the world and technology is progressing and i got so freaked out to the point that i felt in my heart that something big was coming that was gonna change the way everything worked. I freaked out 6-7 people needlessly, and I felt no regret or remorse for those people. They were and still are my friends, and they had learned to accept that I can become rather crazy at times. I was a violent and borderline scary kid and that continued on into my life. 

Around the same time as my meltdown about everything changing I became absolutely obsessed with death. I become obsessed with murder and the desire to kill, i got it so in my head that i was a sociopath, and a narcissist that there wasnt a doubt in my mind about it. I seeked therapy because I started scaring my mom. I knew how to make the therapist think what I wanted them to, my violent and murderous desires became depression and hatred for my father as far as they knew. My father is a sociopath, no donut about that, anyhow, i went to therapy a few times before i convinced my mom that she didn't like the guy and that i was agreeing. I was manipulative and controlling and I did it well, most people didn't (and still don't) see through it (people are surprisingly easy to control) especially my mother. I mean hell my dad did it for 20 years, she didn't even notice until they separated and i pointed it out to her, my brothers learned too but it took them more time, but i wasn't controlled as easily. 

Now moving on to more recent matters in my life, my insomnia was catching up to me, the headaches and fucked up headspace became hard to handle, when i was 16 i started using marijuana, and it mellowed me out a lot. I felt sane for the first time in my life, like i was fully in control, however this quickly made my angry depression turn into sad hopeless depression. I walked this earth as a shell of depression for 3 straight years. And it was worthless time spent, my love for information and knowledge slowly faded away and I became a pothead. In those 3 years from 2017- now i had only been sober for longer than 3 days 5 times, 3 of which were only for a little over a week, and 2 times when i was 17 for 2 week periods of time. However for the first time since then i've been clean for almost a month, i smoked a little here and there, but what ultimately lead me to quit was my tolerance. For some reason or another starting about a month before i quit every time i smoked i would green out, reach a point of mental chrisis, it could be existential where i could see everything going wrong with my life, or borderline psychosis, i could sit there for hours laughing at my own thoughts, or getting so in my head i literally thought i was mentally retarded. So i quit. 

One month later, and i feel like the same kid i was when i was 14 going crazy and sending people the ramblings of a mad man at 5am. I have started to think maybe i am [REDACTED_NAME], maybe i have more than a few screws in my head lose, but this time i have accepted it, i don't care who or what i lose any longer. I simply am, and i'm [REDACTED_NAME] longer going to fight this version of me, i accept me, maybe i'm [REDACTED_NAME] it, or maybe i was never all there, maybe only time can tell",3,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zqxtn5,1671565912,12/20/2022 19:51,TrueOffMyChest,My brother SAed me when I was a child and now that he is getting married I want to ruin the wedding and expose him,"I (23F) was sexually assaulted by my step brother when I was a child. I don’t remember the exact age because it was never brought up by my parents. I assume i was 4-5 years old and he was in his late teenage years.
I remember very clearly the details of it, and I remember being hit by my parents when they knew.
I’m very upset and mad about it because it affected my sexuality now that I’m grown. 
His wedding is in 2 months, I don’t hate him personally but I hate the fact that he is living his best life with his fiancé and I’m still suffering from the consequences of his actions and my parents neglect. 
This is an intrusive thought but I might expose him for that on the wedding day.
Edit: as I remember it was only once or twice, i had a very traumatic childhood and I have forgotten a lot of things, sorry for the lack of details.

Edit: I read most of the comments, thank you so much for your support
Im glad I posted here because there was a lot of things brought to my attention that didn’t cross my mind before.
As someone said I’m the one who will live the rest of my life with consequences of this action 
and the fiancé has nothing to do with that and she deserves to know privately. 
So now that i feel obligated to let her know, I’m trying to figure out how I’d do it. I will update you when I fully decide on it.",5835,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1lhhmdp,1750575183,6/22/2025 6:53,stories,I cancelled the hotel reservations for his daughter's wedding less than 30 days before,"It started off bad. I got the call in April.

""Hello, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Martinez. I'm a lawyer in Washington, DC. My daughter is getting married on September 7th and I need to hold 10 rooms...""

The conversation lasted 30 minutes, during which I learned:

1. Greg was a lawyer (x3)
2. His daughter was getting married (x2)
3. The wedding venue was a nearby boutique hotel. The venue was expensive, so he was hoping to save money booking at my place.
4. He didn't want to reserve the rooms; he wanted me to hold them for his family to book, individually. (x2)
5. Since they were taking the entire house, he wanted a group discount. (x5)

I informed him that there would be no discounts of any kind for that time period, as the local football team was scheduled for a home game. I also required two night stays. I tried to sound firm to discourage haggling, but it was an uphill battle. About half of the conversation was composed of repeated requests and denials. At the end of the call, I promised to hold the rooms, but required a signed contract and a deposit.

So, I typed up a contract for the first time, ever. The entire time, I was very conscious that he was a lawyer and pushy for favorable terms. I sent the contract to him, hoping not to hear back. But the signed contract was sent back the next day. I updated the computer to reflect the deal. I also left a copy of the contract at the computer for staff to review.

The next day, Greg's mother called. I spent 15 minutes explaining to her that she had to book two nights to satisfy the contract, but eventually she declined. The next day, she called back and made a one-night reservation with an employee. I was annoyed. When I discovered the mistake, I decided to let it slide. But I locked the room block so that only I could book more rooms.

Over the next week, I had many conversations with Greg's family. It was always the same: ""I want one night, just like grandma, and group discounts are really what we deserve."" I resisted these demands to much frustration. I was spending a lot of time explaining the contract to the family, but they had difficulty understanding.

Over the next few months, I had many more conversations with Greg and family. If they couldn't get discounts, they wanted upgrades or special favors. The entitlement and persistence were making me anxious and angry. More than one told me ""that the customer is always right."" Infuriating. We had a deal.

Greg, in particular, was maddening. We had three conversations specifically about one-night room requests. His logic said that since I had already agreed to one exception, there was some kind obligation/expectation that more should follow. I am [REDACTED_NAME] a lawyer and I think he intended to exploit my ignorance. But I remained firm. And increasingly angry.

28 days before the reservation, we had another phone call. Greg was hoping for ""wedding amenities"", something I didn't offer, by which he meant ""provide us flowers and champagne"". This was to be instead of a group discount, which was still an expectation, somehow, months later. I was done; feeling exploited and bullied.

""Let me see what my wife thinks,"" I said.

I found my wife and asked her to find the deposit that was required by the contract. The Martinez family money no longer mattered to me. I wanted to find a loophole in the contract. I wanted out. After two hours of very, very detailed searching, my wife came back and told we never deposited a deposit check. It was past due.

My emotions suddenly became a jumble of joy and malice. I spent 5 minutes writing an email to Greg explaining that he'd failed the contract and that his family was no longer welcome to patronize my business. I clicked ""send"". I felt liberated. I no longer cared about being sued or being a bad host. I cancelled the reservations and opened up the rooms to be booked. Every member of Greg's family got a cancellation email, with the notation, ""Ask Greg Martinez about these circumstances"". He can embarrass himself with my input.

I fully expected blowback, but there were no more communications with the Martinez family, except one missive months later. A Martinez, in response to a marketing email, let me know how put out they were having to try to find rooms at the last minute on a busy football weekend. They had to stay out of town and rent a bus. I was a horrible, terrible person. This just made my day.

It's important to remember that the customer is always right. It's equally important to remember that not everybody is a customer.",4114,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bhqycg,1556309972,4/26/2019 20:19,self,I’ve never written about the woman who abused me.,"Fair warning, this is going to be a little long: 

Some background: when was 15 I got casually into forum-based role playing on an online art community. You know, THAT gray-green online art community. The specific group I joined focused on original content that the members essentially made up the parameters of in terms of the fictional universe, the kinds of characters, the setting, etc. It was a lot of fun for my dorky, creative self who had lots of time to kill the summer before my junior year of high school. In this group I met a girl we’ll call B who immediately latched onto me because she liked my art style and because I was regularly making sketches of the characters in the group. B was a little older than everyone else, 19 to be exact, so we all looked up to her as our unofficial authority figure even though she wasn’t a moderator of the group. 

As the summer drew on I became a lot more active in the group, posting regularly and getting closer to B since the year before my older sister had grown distant from me after she moved out and started college. B sort of filled that older sister-shaped gap in my life, especially because I was insecure about my interests and, for all intents and purposes, was straight edge (no alcohol, drugs, dating, etc.), so I was passively looking for guidance. B liked that about me because she hadn’t had the easiest life and had faced some abuse in her adolescence. She liked that I was “pure” (her words). I remember at one point she made me promise her I wouldn’t partake in any “illicit” activities until I was out of high school or could do them for the first time with her. She lived halfway across the country from me and I didn’t have access to a lot of those things anyway so it didn’t bother me to make that promise. 

And then, slowly but surely, she began isolating me from the rest of the role-play group, getting me involved in more 1-on-1 threads until we were both exclusively writing with each other only on a DM platform. We had exchanged phone numbers and we started texting everyday at all hours when I was a school or unable to get on our DMs. For about 3 years she was the first person I spoke to in the morning and the last person I spoke to at night every single day. I remember feeling at the time that this relationship felt almost like love. We were telling each other we loved each other everyday in a way I felt was platonic (I hadn’t realized I was queer yet), but eventually she told me she had romantic feelings for me. 

I told her I didn’t feel the same way and if I could pinpoint a moment when things really felt like they started to change, that was it. She stopped taking the medication for her depression because she said I was enough to keep her happy. I was never allowed to disagree with her on anything, if I did I was always in the wrong, and a lot of those times ended with me put down and in tears. I remember a time when I left the computer for a moment to use the restroom and when I came back she chewed me out for an hour because “it would’ve taken literally 5 seconds” to tell her where I was going. I had to apologize for going to take a piss. The stories we started writing got darker too, I remember an instance when she pressured me into writing out a rape fantasy she had where I had to play the part of the rapist. I couldn’t figure it out then, but looking back now I can tell I was dissociating for that entire experience. It makes me feel sick just to think about it now. 

On top of the gaslighting and verbal abuse, I was also struggling a lot during this time because I was staying up until 4-5AM writing with her and then waking up at 6:30AM to go to school. It killed my social life, my health, and my self worth. I started isolating myself from my family because she thought I “spent too much time with them”. But I was convinced I loved her, that she was my very best friend and that no one or nothing had as much significance in my life. I was in this little bubble with B where we would just write out our fantasies and relentlessly care about each other. I even flew out to spend a week with her over the spring break of my senior year. It was the first trip I had ever taken on my own and while nothing seriously bad happened I have a feeling if I has given her an inch it may have.

I started realizing just how truly messed up our relationship was when the night before my high school graduation ceremony she drove me to tears because I had mentioned that things were getting rough between us to my younger sister. B was horrified that I would even say anything bad about her to my family and said if things ever felt bad I should ONLY be talking to her about it because she didn’t want my family to think she was a bad person. Looking back she must have been feeling tense because I would be going to college soon and she wouldn’t be able to attend the same university with me because she couldn’t afford the out of state tuition. I have a very specific memory of her telling me she was “a little seed beached on the shore of a river and that she would latch onto me as I floated by and ride my current.” It felt like an uncomfortable comment to make then and looking back at it now I can see it as a perfect metaphor for unhealthy dependency. 

Before I knew it I was in college, living away from my parents for the first time, making friends and having experiences I had only written about in my stories. I started talking to B less and less mostly because I was busy, but also because I was loving this feeling of, well, freedom. I met a girl I really liked, who encouraged me to explore my sexuality, and I started feeling like I was becoming the person I wanted to be. B didn’t respond well to any of this. She told me I wasn’t allowed to be with any other women if they weren’t her and that I was ruining her life. She had become incredibly panicked that I was abandoning her. 

At the climax of it all, she video called me and attempted suicide in front of me. She said things like it was my fault she was going to die, that I was the worst person she had ever met, and that she would never forgive me for what I had done to her. I had to call 911 from across the country to send an ambulance to her apartment and they were able to save her. That was by far one of the worst days of my entire life. It still took me a year to cut her out of my life completely after that. I wasn’t quite sure how to function without talking to her every day, she knew everything about me, I still cared deeply about her. But now I knew just how toxic our relationship was and I had other friends who were able to tell me that, to make it real. 

It’s been almost 5 years since I cut B out of my life. I think the damage of that relationship has been done, I have pretty rough anxiety and some deep seeded trust issues, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] better now than I was back then. I have an amazing support network of friends, I’m living independently from my parents, and I’m marrying my best friend next year. The majority of my days are full of warmth and love, but there are days like today where I end up on one of B’s old social media accounts and wonder if she ever thinks about me and feels hatred, or guilt. I feel nervous even writing this post, wondering if putting these out into the virtual ether will eventually find its way to her- would she come after me? Would she put me down like she did before? 

If she did, I think I know what I would say,

“I forgive you for what you did, for everything that happened, but it’s time to move on.”

But if she doesn’t, those words can be fore me.",2,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wlkt0j,1660201049,8/11/2022 6:57,offmychest,Sifting Through the Ashes,"In the days preceding my surgery, I had gone down the internet rabbit hole into surgical complications. I was having surgery to remove a tumor. It was benign, but still needed to be removed. I read up on anesthesia, clots, infections, strokes, and all other manner of dreadful circumstances that could befall me.  It just so happened that my stepfather was having a similar surgery on his own tumor on the same day as mine. My level of concern did not extend to his operation, or the repercussions therein.

In all honesty, I didn't care about him. There was no love within our relationship. I can only speak for my side, so I will not claim to speak for him. His abusive nature could have hidden the affection, just as his father had withheld it from him. I was always under the microscope, nit-picked for the slightest transgressions. While the physical abuse wasn't extreme, the damage had been done through the environment of fear he created. There was no healing the rift between us, but things between us had started to get better. I had turned sixteen and was suddenly on his eye level. With my older siblings out of the house, it was just him, my mom, and myself. We stayed out of each other's life, and things were manageable.

I went in for my operation first. The nervous energy ebbed as I was prepped and maneuvered into the surgical theater. My last thoughts as I counted back from 10 was my recently departed grandmother.

""Treasure this life. It's the only one you have, and it can be gone in an instant."" Her words drifted through the ether; whispers only I could hear as the world went black.

\*\*\*

I made it through without any issues. 

""The osteoid osteoma was removed without complication. You will need to wear this cast for the next few months, and you should avoid walking as much for the first few days."" The surgeon went over a list of things to watch for, to monitor, and then a list of things to seek immediate emergency assistance with. The worry I felt was gone. The chance of any of those bad things happening is very low. I felt reassured. 

After picking up my prescriptions, my dad brought me home to my Mom's house. My parents had divorced when I was young, and it took awhile for them to form a working co-parenting relationship. We ordered pizza, I played some video games while he watched TV upstairs, and we enjoyed the quiet. My mom called him as we got settled to let him know my stepdad's surgery was done, but there was issues bringing him out of the anesthesia. I didn't think anything of it at the time.

 When my Dad told me later that my Mom would not be home that night, I was told it was only due to an abundance of caution. They were still planning to discharge him the next morning, and would be home by noon.

""Okay. Thanks for letting me know. Are you spending the night?"" I asked him, but he shook his head. After a serious fall the year before, my father had nearly died. He was still suffering from the effects, and he said he could only sleep well in his own bed. Anyways, I was sixteen and could always call him if I needed him.

After his truck pulled out of the driveway, I hobbled over to my computer to check if I got a message on AIM. I'd met a girl I'd met while playing Starcraft and wanted to see if she was online. I'd just missed her, so I took my Vicodin and went to sleep instead.

\*\*\*

I awoke the next day to the smell of bacon, eggs, and hash browns. I tore into the delicious breakfast my Dad had prepared. We didn't chat while we ate. We each read the paper, exchanging sections as we finished them. It was nice to see my dad getting his appetite back, although his weight was still drastically under where he was before the fall. I saw the frailty within a body that had previously exuded strength. I knew he suffered with pain, and saw it in his face as he scrubbed the cast iron pan.

He wasn't one to share that pain unless it became unmanageable. Grabbing my crutches, I came up behind him and gave him a quick hug.

""Thanks for the breakfast Dad.""

""Uh-huh. I gotta go run a few errands, but they'll be home by noon."" 

I picked back up on the game I had started the day before. It was around 10:30. Around 12:30, my Moms car pulled into the driveway. My Mom got out of the car first, going around to the other side to open the door for my Stepfather. They walked extremely slowly to the front door, but it was apparent right away that something was wrong. At the time, I could not put my finger on it. I saw a deep, existential fear within the cold blue eyes. He did not speak to me as they came in the entryway.   


My mom came down to the stairs to give me a hug. I looked over her shoulder at him. Never did his eyes meet mine, nor did he give any indication of sensing my presence. He was lost in his thoughts, and I would have never pried. I had a short conversation with my Mom, and then went back to my game.   


An hour or so passed, and I realized I was overdue for one of my painkillers. I had taken one with breakfast, but that was nearly four hours ago and the dull pain of my surgery was starting to push through. I went in the bathroom, grabbed a glass of water, and took another pill. I was just about to sit back down when I heard a blood-curdling scream from upstairs, followed by a loud thud. In a flash, I dropped my crutches and ran upstairs. I ran up all sixteen stairs. I reached the top of the stairs and saw my stepfather twitching on the floor by the kitchen sink. Blood was pooling around his head. I do not remember hearing my Mom call 911, but I could see her on the phone. I did not offer aid to my stricken Stepfather. I did not move from the top of the stairs. I watched his life slip away as his skin grew pale and his limbs grew still. I was still frozen as the first responders rushed through the front door.   


""Can you go downstairs?"" The firefighter asked. I nodded, and went back downstairs. I stood at the windows in the basement, staring out the front window at the chaos. Most of the responders came in their personal vehicles, but eventually the ambulance and firetrucks showed up. My Stepfather had been a volunteer firefighter, an EMT, and worked as a police dispatcher, so all of the responders knew when they got the call. I heard them struggle as they carried him down the stairs and out to the waiting ambulance. The firetruck followed it out of the driveway, and then the remaining vehicles did as well. I was left alone, and I came upon the realization that my life was now irrevocably changed.  


I knew he was dead before I got the call from my Mom. Staring at the blood still seeping into the kitchen carpet, I knew he was gone. I went numb, a feeling that would persist for years following the trauma. I had come face to face with real mortality that day, and I have carried that weight with me ever since. I tried and failed to meet Death myself in the years following that event, all because of that day in September. He was 38 years old, the same age I am [REDACTED_NAME]. He seemed old when I watched him die that day. Now I realize how young he still was, and why he was so scared. He saw Death, and got to meet Him. I am [REDACTED_NAME] I did not.   


My wife and daughters sleep upstairs as I try to finally release the flood gates I've held in place for so long. It's taken me twenty-two years to finally seek help for that day. I wanted to share my story, so others may hopefully also find the way.

1egjw5m,1722422197,7/31/2024 10:36,stories,The Worst Heartbreak I've Ever Experienced,"Hello Reddit, long time lurker, first time poster. For the sake of everyone involved, I will keep this as nameless as possible. I wrote this months ago around February, but decided to share it now because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a new ""relationship"" (quotes because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] too sure of what it means just yet) and I've been finding it a bit difficult to move past what happened in my previous one. It might help move some healing forward. Apologies in advance, but this is going to be a bit of a loooong once. Please find the TLDR at the very end.

In 2022, I had met someone who I believed to be amazing and potentially the love of my life. We matched on Tinder and we went on our first date. He (23m at the time now) was from South America, and he had moved to my (24f at the time) home country here in Africa (don’t want to specify countries as they are a bit unique). During this first date, we spent 17 hours together, talking, laughing, getting deep, and really seeing each other. I thought I had met someone different and wonderful.

A couple weeks later of a few more dates, he asks me to be his girlfriend, which I say yes to. He is the first person in a very long time who made me feel special and happy. He was consistent and very loving. When discussing when our anniversary should be (either our first date or when he asked me to be his girlfriend), he said it should be our first date as that was the day he had fallen in love with me. As our bond started getting stronger, he made claims of wanting to marry me, saying he cannot live without my love anymore, that I have shown him what real unconditional love is, so on and so forth. You get the picture.

He said that he had never had stability in his life, and I was showing him through myself and my love for him what he needs. He said that no one in his life ever showed him what this means. I showed him through my friendships (who also became friends with him because he was great at that time), my siblings, my parents, everyone around me, what real love is. The way I was so genuine made him feel like good people like me really do exist.

Months pass and we are happily in love, communication is amazing, our bedroom life is amazing, and our time together was always fun. He wrote me love letters, always got me flowers, going out on dates, etc. So, I thought we were good. Since he had always said he wanted to marry me, I told him then lets make a five year plan. We are both in our twenties and experiencing the work force for the first time, so lets be serious if he wants to be. I told him, if he isn’t ready for that, that was okay, but to talk about it. He said nothing different. There were courses he wanted to take to help him with his job, I researched and came up with lists for him. I found countries we could move to with both of our passports and made Pinterest boards for what our house could look like.

A few more months pass, and a few things start to change. I started falling to a dark place, but ignored it for so long that it hit harder than I expected. I talked with him about it, and he encouraged me to speak with friends and family. I have undergone about 4-5 years of therapy as a teen due to other reasons, so I had a number of healthy coping mechanisms as well as an understanding of how to get myself out of a situation like this. Never applied any pressure on him to be the person to take on everything.

But during this time, I had a few break downs and sometimes friends weren’t available. When that happens, I try to call him, because I don’t want to call him every time something happens, he is usually my second-to-last or last resort. He would say he would give me a call in 5 min, but just wouldn’t call back at all, or if he did, he was drunk/too stoned to think. Sometimes he wouldn’t answer all day. I never wanted him to come rushing to me to take care of me, just answering the phone to say “hey, you’re okay” and to let me vent a bit. The first time it happened, I thought okay, it happens, and I told him that if he couldn’t get back to me, it was okay, to just tell me he couldn’t speak right now. He told me okay, and that it wouldn’t happen again. Then it happened a second time. I again told him, if you’re not going to do something, just don’t tell me you’ll do it, it’s better to not speak than to give empty promises. I’m not the type of person to get bothered by things like this, but more importantly, I really don’t like when someone promises to do something and they don’t follow up.

Then, it happened for the third time. I put my foot down and gave him an out. I have been there for him for some horrible moments he has experienced in our year together, so I don’t think I was stupid to expect that back from him. Especially since he claimed that we were each other’s best friends. Essentially, I told him if he doesn’t want to be with me any longer after seeing this side of me, then he can tell me honestly and we can move from there. I told him that if he cannot be there for me, then to tell me now and to not make me feel like I have to beg to get him to speak to me.

I never needed partnership to survive. I was without him this long; I can continue to be without him if necessary. It’s harsh, but I know myself, and I refuse to make myself the bad guy because I’m having some nights where I need a bit of extra comfort. Especially, since that’s what we both said we were here to do for each other. I had always told him there was space for honesty, asking him if he still wanted to be with me (even outside the time I put my foot down), telling him it’s okay, we can slow down, etc. He never said anything different.

I finally started really getting out of the dark place and started doing things to improve my mental health, work life, and physical health. I started working out more, started seeing some friends more, and I told him he was more than welcome to join me on any of these things. He had been wanting to work out for a long time and I offered him to join me, yet he refused. He said he was too tired or too lazy, which was fine. That’s his prerogative, but it wouldn’t stop me. He always supported me, making sure I was doing all that. 

A month after this, in October 2023, I got very ill. I had a chest infection that lasted a few days and I could hardly speak or move out of bed. He was on a work trip a couple hours away from the main city (this was normal for the entirety of our relationship), and he called and texted frequently to see if I was okay. Telling me that when we see each other on Friday, he would take care of me.

Friday comes around, and I feel a lot better. My antibiotics were working really well and I was able to speak more than a few sentences without a hacking fit. But he didn’t answer any of my texts from the night before or the morning (he always consistently sent I love you’s, good nights, and Good Morning’s every day). I ask him if I did anything wrong, and that he could talk to me about anything always. Then he says this:

“Hey, it isn't that you did something, its just I have been feeling weird and I don't know how to talk about it with you.

I don't want you to stress over the weekend or anything like that about what this is...Do you think we can see eachother on Sunday to get together and talk things out? I miss you too but I need some time and space to think about how I am [REDACTED_NAME].

Im sorry for being so distant while you were sick and in general, its my fault not yours that we haven't been talking much.

I hope you can understand and we can talk about it on Sunday

Love you”

So, now I’m panicking. I didn’t feel him being distant, because he was calling me and saying “I love you” etc the entire time. There was no distance at all from what I know of. Immediately I knew he wanted to break up with me. But why? I had no idea, up until then, he was as consistent as he was from the very beginning of our relationship. I waited patiently till Sunday. I didn’t call, I didn’t text. I gave him his space to figure it out, except for once asking what time and where to meet on Sunday.

Sunday comes (this is the last week of October), and he breaks up with me, both of us crying at the cafe. Hard. Him harder than me. I won’t write everything but here are the major points:

1.     We both are not financially stable, if he has to move from the country and I move with him, he can’t support me, and he’s worried that would break our relationship.

2.     He still lives with his dad here in my country and he can’t see a life where the three of us have to live in a house together because of how much he depends on his dad currently.

3.     He has a lot of issues he needs to deal with himself, I have showed him so much love and care that he needs to give to himself, and wants to do just that.

4.     He didn’t want to drag me down in the process of him making himself better.

5.     He said in verbatim: “This isn’t about other women, I want to focus on myself, and become the type of man you deserve to be with.”

So, I let it happen. I was devastated, the most heartbroken I have ever been in my life. But I told him how strong he must be to tell me all of this, that he was so honest and kind. I felt even more heartbroken for him than for myself. We agreed that in a few weeks’ time I would go to pick up my stuff. I was whiplashed and confused for those next two weeks. Diving into straight work, going to the gym, meeting with friends, anything to distract me from the pain that I felt waking up every day.

Finally, I went to go pick up my stuff (this is mid-November). This falls on the day of our one-year anniversary. We finish packing my stuff, laugh, talk, and think about all the good times we had. Obviously still being sad. We ended up getting intimate, but I’m not a fool. I wanted to do this one last time so we would have one beautiful last night together of kissing and cuddling. I knew I needed to do it one last time, so it could be our last time ever. Once we finished, he turned and asked me what time I was going home. Confused, I said I thought I was spending the night. He then says he thought that since he has to work the next day and so do I, that I would go home. I was hurt, deeply. I didn’t understand how he thought this was how our last night was going to be like. We always spent the night together, this shouldn’t be any different, as it was literally our last night. I started crying, and the tears wouldn’t stop. I tried everything I could to calm down, but I just couldn’t stop crying. He felt bad and asked if we can have the last night another night, in two weeks time, I tell him I cannot prolong this heart break, it already hurt so much waiting two weeks to see him, I can’t wait another two weeks for another heart-breaking moment. I already was having chest pains. He then says I should spend the night, that I can’t go home crying this hard. He said that he wanted us to be friends, and that we should figure out a way for us to stay in each other’s lives, without it being too hard on both of us. I agreed, and the best way to do this was to not be intimate, to not act like a couple, and to be genuine friends to one another. He said he would do all that, because he couldn’t not have me in his life. He said let’s meet in two weeks. I said okay.

So, we wake up the next day, he goes to work, I call a cab and place all my stuff in the car and go home to get ready for work. I felt heartbroken all over again, taking all my stuff back meant that it really was over, and that this relationship was done. For the next couple of months, I woke up with even more immense chest pains, specifically on my left side (which I now realise was pain from heart break), and I couldn’t eat properly, I gym regularly (mainly weightlifting) and I kept losing weight. I was feeling nauseous, and I began to isolate, stopped going out to meet people (unless it was this small bar that is across the street from my apartment). But I held all of this to myself, and I told everyone around me that I was okay, and that I felt worse for him because he had to make such a difficult decision. That it takes a man to be able to let someone you love so much go.

A month goes by, I was still heart broken, still confused. I was still holding my feelings, because I was imagining how much of a hard time he was going through. However, I had reached out as we were meant to meet two weeks after I had taken all my stuff back (and, admittedly I had left two things in his freezer I couldn’t take at the time, so I wanted to use those as an excuse to see him again), asking if he was ready to have a friend dinner, and just to catch up. He took a day to respond (understandable). This is his text:

“Hey, hope you are doing well too :)

And yeah I was hesitant because of time passing by and all...

I do want to see you, but I don't know how ready I am [REDACTED_NAME] us to go out as friends yet, not because I don't want to but because I still have feelings for you and need a bit more time, I hope you are ok with this because I would like to see you sometime soon”

I understood, as I still had feelings for him too. But I responded with:

“hey, i understand, its okay

take as much time as you need and when you're ready we can hang out :) 

next time please dont hesitate to reach out though, you're allowed to be honest about how you feel and what you're ready for and we'll work through it whenever that time comes.

i hope you have a good rest of your week”

And he didn’t respond after that. It was radio silence, and I was still dealing with this heart break and the chest pains. More than anything, I was still imagining how heartbroken he must be. Two lovers who cannot continue because of circumstances. Devastating.

A few more weeks go by, and he sends me this message out of the blue: 

“Hey \[OP\], hope things have been well and life isn't too crazy lately

I have not known how to text you given that things are as they are now between us, not meaning anything bad, but distant for sure, mainly because of me... 

I have come to realize I really need to still focus on my personal growth and how it has taken a lot of energy from me, mentally and physically, to start straightening my life once again, but more. This past time without you has been crazy difficult and lonely, I miss you and us just existing and enjoying eachother. I really do. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] grateful and happy for the time we spent together, but I feel like we have to let eachother go, I don't want you waiting for me to be better, it just doesn't seem fair to you at all.

I just want you to know that, I have never been loved so well, that I thank you for all the good and bad times were we held eachother up. I will never forget what it means to love someone and be loved unconditionally.

Much love always, \[His Name\].

Also, I still have your salmon and shrimp at the house, dunno if they are still good but they are still frozen for sure. If you ever want to pick them up or something let me know so you can have them.

Felt like you didn't want to ask for it...”

I almost fell to my knees. I wanted to scream cry into the wind. As I cried, I asked him if I could take a few more days to write a response. I was so heartbroken; I couldn’t even have him in my life as a friend. Letting him go completely meant shutting the door of a potential future together. I can never see him again, or see how he’s doing, or anything. It was truly, really over. The pain was too much to bear. Even more painful for him, to think that it wasn’t fair on me to make me wait. I collected myself over the next few days and wrote this response:

“hey hey, i’m sorry it took me a while to respond. when i first got your message i honestly didn’t know what to do with myself or how to respond. i wanted the initial shock to clear away first before i wrote back.

life has been quite crazy for me actually (both good and bad), but i hope you’re doing well too and life isn’t as crazy for you

i’m really happy to hear that you are working hard to get your life straightened out, and i want you to know you will always have my full support in everything that you do, especially this, even if i can’t be there to see it. this is an incredibly difficult journey for anyone, and i’m so proud of you for taking this bull by the horns. i still believe 100% that you deserve to get to a place where you are proud of what it took to get you there. you are a wonderful soul who deserves to let the universe inside you grow in all ways possible

this past time without you has also been incredibly painful and lonely for me, and i'm [REDACTED_NAME] gonna lie, it’s been the most difficult thing i have experienced/still experiencing in almost a decade. i never dreamed of meeting someone like you so early on in my life, and the hardest part is having to not only lose you as a partner, but as my best friend too. i don’t want to, but for the sake of growth, i guess we can let each other go. this is going to be the second most difficult thing for me to do.

i will never forget everything you’ve done for me, our time together, and how amazing you have been throughout. thank you for being you and allowing me to experience us in the best way possible. you allowed me to see and to experience what it means to really let myself love and be loved unconditionally and wholeheartedly. i hope you always remember your worth and how much you deserve to be loved and cared for the way i have done for you

much love always, \[OP\]

as for the salmon and shrimp, you can keep it, it’s too painful for me to come and get it. i hope that’s okay and that you understand why.”

And that was that. I cried nonstop after I sent that, it felt like I couldn’t breathe. I was in whirlwind of emotions. How hard of a decision was this to make for him was what calmed me down mostly, and made me control my emotions. That I had to be strong for me and for him. But a day or two later, I was on Facebook, and noticed that his father was posting pictures from a different country in Africa that he was visiting. Confused, I immediately logged back into my Instagram (I had deleted my social media apps a month before our break up). I see his story, and he is also in that country. I begin to think “did he send me that message so he can travel guilt free?” but I kept talking myself out of feeling that way. Thinking that this is just my anxiety and heartbreak. That’s not fair of me to think like that, he deserves to be happy and go on holiday. Just because I threw myself into my job and gym, doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be enjoying life. Especially because it was New Years. 

As a few more weeks passed, I start to check his story every once in a while, just to see how he is doing. One day, I’m on there and saw he had removed the picture of us together. I understood. But when I went to his following list, I saw that he had unfollowed me (but still allowed me to follow him), I was confused as I was still not officially back on social media except for the occasional checking on him once/twice a week, so I scroll down the list to see if he had unfollowed anyone else.

A bit of back story for context: As I said, we had met on Tinder. He had also matched with another girl I knew before we dated (my city is very small, everyone knows someone somehow). He had unfollowed her and removed her from his follower list when we became official, stating that he didn’t need to follow her anymore (he said he does this when he doesn’t feel like following a person anymore). Cool. Back to the story.

I see that he had refollowed her and accepted her follow request, meaning that he had gone back on Tinder to find her username. So, it meant he was back on there, mainly because after a year of us being together, there was no way he would have memorized her username. I scroll further and see a few more women that I know were on Tinder and they were following each other. I became a bit enraged, but kept my cool as I thought he’s single, he can do what he wants. I couldn’t see his stories anymore, which I thought came from him unfollowing me.

The following days, checking his following list, I noticed he unfollowed two of my best friends, but continued to follow everyone else I introduced him to (including two of my other really close friends, my brothers who are very close to me, etc.). I told my best friends this, and we were confused. We had a sleep over and spent a bit of time trying to figure out more, and then I noticed that he had posted a story that day. I asked them if he had been posting regularly, and they said yes. Meaning he had blocked only me off his story. I was really confused by this because all he posts are plants, the sky, the occasional office shot, and music. There was nothing to hide.

A couple more days go by, and I call a very good friend of mine to vent. He listens at first, but cuts me off halfway, saying he needed to tell me something, but to meet him in person. I agree and we meet up for coffee the following week.

He asks how I am [REDACTED_NAME], the process I’ve been going through, (this friend of mine is like my life guru and I value him very highly, he’s been my friend for almost ten years, my oldest friend honestly). I explain everything and when I finish, he asks if I am [REDACTED_NAME] to hear what he has to say, I nod and he begins to tell me.

I won’t get into the details as this is my friend’s private business, but essentially, a few months before this, he told me that a woman he knows gave him access to her Tinder and as he was scrolling (very far down the interaction list I might add), he saw my ex’s name pop-up. By sheer luck, this information was in my friend’s hands now. Curious, for my sake of course, he opens it and sees that my ex had been having this exchange with this woman since September. A whole month before he broke up with me. The last messages being in November, two to three “Hey’s” which she didn’t respond to. My friend at the time didn’t say anything, at the time, as he wanted to make sure I was really in a good place to hear this information. Specifically, at a place where I was getting ready to let my ex go, so that this could be the final push.

As he told me, I felt everything around me crumble. I have been cheated on in my past and my ex knows this. He has also been cheated on. Whenever he needed reassurance, I would give it to him and vice-versa. In the past, we have had a lengthy discussion on trust, cheating, lying, and everything in between. Like I said, we had a very open communication relationship. I told him, that personally, I believe cheating is a hateful act, because when you cheat, it means you do not care about your partner at all, and you are placing your selfish needs over having an honest conversation that could save your partner from pain and betrayal. I strongly believe no one belongs to anyone, that everyone is free to do what they want, as long as they are honest about it and want to own up to their actions. If anything, the person owes it to the other to honestly say they want to step out, so the other person has every right to react to the truth. But he didn’t do that. He just lied. Over, and over, and over again. He might have lied to “spare my feelings” but I was putting his feelings ahead of my own, because I believed he made a hard decision. The real decision he made was that he wanted to explore his options, and get rid of me in the process. Instead of letting me have those true feelings, he lied to make himself look like the hero.

Now, I’m not going to say anything except that this is only one woman’s story that I know of (she doesn’t know me, and I don’t know her), but from the other context clues, the only reasonable thing I can think of is that he was getting ready to cheat on me (if he didn’t already), but either by just wanting to get me out of the way, or by guilt, he finally broke up with me. I don’t know when he got back on Tinder, if it was before he talked to this woman or if it started with her, but I knew his phone password, and used his Instagram to look things up to show him while I was off my Instagram, but I never went through his phone. I trusted him. He had his finger print on my phone, so it was mutual. I would never in a million years have guessed that he was capable of this, especially because as I wrote previously, he was consistent, up until the day he broke up with me. He knew my feelings about cheating, he knew that I believed it was a hateful act. 

I don’t really understand any of it, and I was hoping Reddit could help me see this clearer or try to get me to understand what is going on. Writing it out made me feel better in some way. I’m not sure how I didn’t see the signs, as I thought I was great at spotting them. I don’t think I could have though, unless I went through his phone, which I believe is the end of any relationship. You don’t invade someone’s privacy like that, because it means there is no trust, and with no trust, there is no relationship

At this stage, I don’t want to confront him, as I don’t think anything could come out of it. He lied straight to my face several times for weeks. It’s not like there was anything we lacked, we were intimate 4-5 times a week, he always wanted me to come over, I was careful of his space, asking if he was sure and he always said “of course, you’re my girlfriend, just come over”. Always saying I love you, always telling me how much he cared for me, how much he respected me. I’m not sure about anything tbh. What I’m sure of though, is that this has really damaged me, and has made me rethink about what trust means to me. The only thing I would like to do is get my nudes off his phone. We had recorded a few tapes as well, I want them off his phone. I don’t want him using my body again for his own self pleasure. I get so sick thinking of him using my pictures and our videos after all the lies he has told me.

How can someone claim to love me so much that they cannot imagine their lives without me, yet be stepping out of the relationship? His last few messages to me made me think he truly loved me. Maybe he did at some point, but definitely not towards the end. I feel sick when I think about the last night we spent together. It makes me think that he actually did want me to go home, like he just wanted to use me one last time, but felt guilty when I was crying. It makes me feel used, like I was just another body to him. Like the year we spent together meant nothing to him, especially on the night of what would have been our one-year anniversary.

My friend who had revealed my ex’s Tinder use, told me this: “People who haven't done the inner work are always going to present a risk to people who trust them. I genuinely believe you gave amazing things to someone who wasn't ready for them, or didn't understand how to handle them with care. This doesn't decrease with age. It decreases with maturity, and people in their early twenties are horrible at boundaries and maturity.” Which helped me think about it a lot.

So, people of Reddit, that’s my story. This has been the worst heartbreak I have ever experienced, and the amount of betrayal I feel is immense. I’m not sure how to conclude this. I’m still working and going to the gym and spending time with friends. My life hasn’t stopped, and the pain is less. I guess if I feel anything, it’s just disappointing. He is not the man I thought he was. All I can do is take the good and learn from the bad I guess. Thanks for reading.

TLDR; I was with someone for the past year who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, and I thought he wanted to spend the rest of his with me (as he told me several times he wanted to marry me and be with me forever). He broke up with me saying that he wanted to better himself and grow into a man who he believed deserves to be with me. A few months later, a friend revealed to me that he was on Tinder a month before he actually broke up with me. Now dealing with trying to move on.",9,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1je12mr,1742290510,3/18/2025 9:35,TrueOffMyChest,"I (23F) ""accidentally"" didn't make it to the bathroom on time at school once when I was 7. No-one knows that I did it on purpose.","I already know that everyone on this subreddit is judging me hardcore but please read this entire post before commenting (lol).  
I am [REDACTED_NAME] to give some context for my non-Australian friends out there. In Australia, in grade 3, 5, 7 and 9, all students are required to complete something called NAPLAN testing. NAPLAN testing consists of group of standardised tests that is similar to the SATs in the US, and are done over roughly 2-4 days. The results of NAPLAN testing is sent to the Bureau of Statistics, and are then used to alter education curriculums and identify what areas in reading, writing, spelling and numeracy that the kids in that year group are struggling with. These are tests that you CANNOT study for or cheat on in any way, and the material on the tests are kept top secret until the day of the test (this piece of information is important for this story, don't worry).

I did my first test, like many others, in grade 3. I was 7 years old at the time. During this exam, however, instead of having our regular teacher supervising us, we had a lady from the government office looking over us. This woman was SCARY. She was like that one gym coach that took everything way too seriously and was overly strict with rules. One of the weird rules that this lady put in place was that during the test (roughly two hours long), we were not permitted to leave the room at any time. This included getting a drink of water, stretching your legs, and going to the bathroom. To make sure of this, she locked the front door with a key. Looking back, this is an insane thing to ask of a classroom of 7 and 8 year old kids who have no control of when they need to go to the bathroom.

The test began as usual, and around 20 minutes in, I felt the need to use the bathroom. However, I was a very shy kid who never asked adults anything, and always kept to myself, so due to my fear of this lady and my fear of confrontation, I held it.

Around 10 minutes go by, and I decide to ask if I can use the bathroom. I raise my hand, the lady comes over to my desk, I ask to go to the bathroom, and she refuses. I simply say 'okay, miss' and continue to hold it.

Another 5 minutes go by, and I raise my hand again to use the bathroom, as I was getting desperate and couldn't focus on my test. She came over and refuses. I said 'okay, miss', and try to get by while holding it. This went on another two times.

At this point, it was roughly 45 minutes into the two hour test, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] struggling to hold it. I am [REDACTED_NAME], I am [REDACTED_NAME], and could not focus at all on the material in front of me. I decide to ask this lady for a fifth time to use the bathroom. She STILL didn't get the hint that I genuinely needed to go. When I raised my hand for the fifth time, she glared at me and stormed over to my desk. She tells me that she 'knows that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to leave so I can cheat on the test' and that she 'doesn't like naughty little fakers like me'. My blood was beginning to boil at this point, as I had followed the rules the whole time, there was no way for a 7 year old to cheat on a test where no-one had the answers and that it was very obvious that I genuinely needed to use the bathroom. This lady looked at me dead in the eyes and scolded at me to sit down and be quiet. I simply said, 'okay, miss'. And stayed silent. She walked back up to the front of the classroom and sat back at her desk to supervise. At this point all of the other kids in my class knew that I was essentially being picked on by this teacher, and began to visibly feel bad for me. My frequent hand-raising was distracted them, as well, as it isn't often that a kid raises their hand that much during a test.

I knew that there was no way for me to complete this test while badly needing the bathroom. Everyone knows the feeling of needing the bathroom so bad that it's all they can think about. I was raging at this, as I had lost my focus and that this lady was being mean to me for absolutely no reason at all. So I decided to have a bit of fun.

I raised my hand for the sixth time. I waited for this lady to notice my raised hand. When she did, she looked INFURIATED and simply HORRIFYING. She had had enough of my 'shenanigans' and actually lost her temper. 

""WHAT?! What is it now?""

I locked eyes with this woman and stared at her. Everyone else in the classroom snapped their heads up, as their focus was now broken by her yelling. I stared. And then I let it loose.

I peed. On purpose. All over the chair. In a silent classroom. All while making direct eye contact with the woman who refused to let me go.

Because I was so mad, and now immediately regretting my decision, I began to cry of embarrassment. I was so pissed off at this lady that I physically couldn't hold my bladder and RAGE PEED IN THE CLASSROOM to prove a point.

It took this lady about two seconds to realise what was happening, and her anger turned to shock. Wow, a grown woman \*shocked\* that refusing a 7 year old to use the bathroom would result in them being unable to hold it. 

She ran over to me, while I was still crying of embarrassment, covered in pee, grabbed me by the wrist, and rushed me out of the classroom and to the school office. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sobbing while I was given a change of clothes and got permission to skip the rest of the test. 

When I got back to class, everyone asked me if I was okay, since they heard me crying during the test, and how I accidentally wet myself during the test. I went along with the accusation and told them that it was an accident.

It wasn't. I was a petty little girl, with no social confidence, who raged peed during a test at the age of 7. 

The reason that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this now is because NAPLAN testing has commenced for the year in Australia as of this week, and talking about it as an adult now reminded me of this incident, and how I never told anyone that it was on purpose.

Feel free to judge me now. I needed to get this off my chest (hence why I posted this on this subreddit), and I can think of this story when I need to channel some petty energy and confidence to do daring shit.

nn1hst,1622218951,5/28/2021 16:22,confession,Took part in horribly vandalizing a public bathroom,"This happened when I was about 13 probably, around 2002 or 2001. We were in this rich part of Southern California. 

My friend let's call him Jack and his older brother John were going to a barbecue at a local park in this neighboring town next to ours. It was the rich, uppity place where if you're from my town you don't like it because they're a bunch of snobs. 

Real uptight folks and such. So anyways their family were having a barbecue with some people from their church group and I tagged along. Us being young boys we immediately started thinking of what can we fuck up, let's raise some hell because we're bored and this was far before everyone had a computer in their pocket. So the only way to entertain ourselves was to find some property to destroy. 

We go to the public bathroom at the park where we were barbecuing which was very nice and clean for a public park bathroom, remember it's in the nice part of town. We immediately start filling the 2 toilets up with sand because we were near the beach. We fill them with sand and all the toilet paper in bathroom and just kept pressing the flush button over and over until it starts overflowing. 

Fast forward about 2 hours later my friend Jack has to take a shit. He goes into the bathroom and is reminded they are unusable. There is no toilet paper and the toilets are full of sand and filled to the top with toilet water. He's freaking out because he has to shit. So I grab him some fliers from his church and he shits behind a tree. I thought we were done fucking with the bathroom for the remainder of the evening. We start packing up to leave and I decide to go take a piss before the ride home.

I go back to the bathroom because we left the urinals unharmed. I walk in and Jack's older brother John is holding his younger brothers piece of shit with a piece of paper and drawing one continuous long squiggly line with the piece of shit across the bathroom wall. When he gets towards the entrance of the door he wrote 

""FUK YOU"" and stuck the remainder of the piece of shit on the wall and it stayed. To this day what I never understood was why he spelled the word fuck incorrectly but the word ""you"" correctly. 

But yea the names have been changed to protect people's identity. I felt bad thinking about the person walking into that place when it was their shift to clean it and seeing a pool of sand and toilet water and a wall with shit going across it. But life goes on.

Edit: I've had a blast reading the comments and really did not expect my story of being a little shithead to get this much attention. I assure you I'm a grown adult and don't do stuff like that now and realize me fucking up public property wasn't the most productive way to pass time. I had a great childhood and was raised well. But I had a phase where I liked to fuck shit up, not animals, not a bully, just playing with matches and raising hell in a public bathroom. To be clear I just poured sand in a toilet, I didn't condone the shit smearing, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] what I did wasn't ok at all.

1kx4hnf,1748395163,5/28/2025 1:19,stories,My parents own a multimillion dollar waste management company and I’ve been working as the lowest guy on the crew without telling anyone who I am,"I’m 22, just graduated from college a few months ago. While my classmates were polishing résumés and stressing over interviews, my parents sat me down and made it clear: I wouldn’t be job hunting. I’d be working for them.

They run a massive waste management company like, city-wide contracts, fleet of trucks, recycling centers, the whole deal. It’s their legacy, and they want me to take over someday. But they also made it clear I wouldn’t be jumping into some cushy office role with a fancy title. If I was going to lead the company, I had to understand it from the ground up.

Fair enough. I actually respected that.

So I started at the very bottom. One day I was on a truck hauling trash bins in the rain, the next I was elbow-deep in recyclables at the sorting center. I never told anyone who I was. I wore the same uniform, followed the same schedule, and showed up like every other new guy. I wanted real experience. No special treatment, no shortcuts.

At first, it was fine. Humbling, even. I started to respect the people who do this every day in ways I couldn’t before. They’re tough. They work hard. But after a while, the vibe started to shift. I was doing more and more of the grunt work while others kicked back. I was told to straighten out the bins, clean up after others, do the “new guy” stuff constantly.

I didn’t complain. I kept my head down. I figured it was part of paying dues.

But then came the day that broke me.

It was raining hard, and we were already short staffed. I barely slept the night before, showed up exhausted, and got drenched within the first hour. My clothes were soaked. I was cold and running on fumes. Still, I pushed through most of the shift until one of the senior guys, Ron, decided he was done.

He dumped the rest of his tasks on me and said, “You’re the new guy, you handle it. I gotta leave early.”

I snapped. Politely, but firmly, I told him no I wasn’t doing his work. I was done letting people pile on just because they outranked me.

He stared at me like I’d grown a second head. Then, with a smirk, he said, “Careful. Management might not like it if I start talking about your attitude.”

I looked him dead in the eye and said, “Then let’s go to management right now.”

He blinked. Didn’t say another word. Just walked off.

That was the first time I’ve ever stood up for myself like that at work. I didn’t play the 'I’m the owner's son' card. I still haven’t. But I’m starting to realize: being the boss’s kid doesn’t mean I have to accept being walked over to prove I’m humble.

1how4hb,1735479309,12/29/2024 13:35,offmychest,I never realized how privileged I really am,"TW - parental abuse and neglect

I (26 F) grew up in a very small town with a huge family. I am [REDACTED_NAME] child in a nine child family. We were always one tragedy away from foster care. My mother mentally just checked out and our father was an alcoholic who turned physically abusive. 

My oldest brother left as soon as he turned 18 and never looked back. Got a full ride to college on football. His leaving broke my mother completely she just started existing after that. Fully ignored all of the children. 

Drew (2nd oldest) just took over the next day. Overnight he was our parent even though he was just 15 yrs old. He earned money however he could. Took our responsibility completely - went to our meetings, came to our games and plays, got us through everything. I have no idea how he did it but he did. 

I never considered myself privileged until I got into med school and came to the city. Everytime the CPS bought in a child, I realized how good I had it.

My father was abusive but Drew never let him beat any of us. We were poor as hell but our brother made sure we were always clothed and fed.He worked everyday but he still showed up at whatever we did - plays, exhibitions, games. We always had a cake for birthday and presents for Christmas. our mother never even picked the younger ones but my brother made sure we all knew that we were loved and worth it. Most of all, even though we had nothing, my brother gave us the freedom and confidence to dream. I am a doctor, my siblings followed their dreams to from  law to modeling. We all did it. 

My brother gave up everything to make sure that we became something. He stayed in closet for years until all of us were out of the town. I am [REDACTED_NAME] fucking privileged because I have a brother who broke the cycle for all of us ",2381,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1hbeze6,1733871798,12/10/2024 23:03,self,"Before you make up your mind on Luigi Mangione based on what the media tells you about him, know that his Reddit account paints its own picture of who he is","There's reason to believe that [REDACTED_USER] is the UHC shooting suspect Luigi Mangione. Credit to [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/spinalfusion/comments/1hajvwr/luigi_mangiones_spinal_fusion_looks_like_an_l5s1/m19pau7/) which is where I first saw this. Dug into the account for the fun of it.

The account is suspended, so all record of its posts/comments comes from Reddit archives.

Archive of all posts from the account: [Primary](https://search.pullpush.io/?kind=submission&author=mister_cactus&size=100), [Secondary](https://ihsoyct.github.io/?mode=submissions&subreddit=&sort_type=created_utc&sort=desc&limit=100&after=&before=&author=Mister_cactus&score=&num_comments=&q=)

Both primary/secondary links should have the same content, but included both in case one goes down or something.

## Proof

It's known that he has a Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, and more, while being a tech bro, so it's no surprise that he'd be on Reddit as well.

Here are some snippets of evidence that I compiled in order to prove that the account belonged to Mangione. Note that the first point here is pretty cut and dry, everything else just further confirms it.

**Linked to his own GitHub**

He commented [this](https://i.imgur.com/mqwhbCy.png) on r/FTC (robotics competition for high schoolers?). Notice that it links to his code on GitHub ... and it's Luigi Mangione's GitHub. Yeah, pretty cut and dry lol.

He was in fact into robotics in high school (and he would be in high school in 2016 so that checks out).

Unfortunately I typed the rest of this out before finding that piece of definitive evidence, so here it is if anyone's curious:

**Attended the University of Pennsylvania during the same time frame**

Luigi Mangione graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020. This [image](https://i.imgur.com/rtAqHfZ.png) shows that the Reddit account posted a question about housing in r/UPenn in 2017, which would check out.

**Was a computer science undergraduate student**

Luigi Mangione majored in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. This [image](https://i.imgur.com/sVwtKXI.png) shows that the Reddit account made a post where he says ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] undergraduate pursuing a degree in computer science,"" again lining up with when he was at UPenn.

**Same age**

In 2018, the Reddit account made a post to r/sleep. Here's an [image](https://i.imgur.com/EfsAt4t.png).

It mentions being a 20-year-old male. 2018 was 6 years ago, and he is now 26-years-old, so this lines up (I do not think we know his exact day of birth).

**Shared an interest in Ted Kaczynski**

According to Mangione's GoodReads account, he left a positive review for the Ted Kaczynski's manifesto and called him a prodigy and political revolutionary. [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/person-interest-unitedhealthcare-shooting-gave-[REDACTED_PHONE]70.html). 

The Reddit account likely posted [this video](https://np.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1czali0/streaming_overdose_2024_china/) to r/tedkaczynski. Technically all we know is that he had a post on r/tedkaczynski with the same title as the post I just linked and his post was two days after the original - we can't see what the attached video was. Given the identical title and being in the same week, it was likely a crosspost. 

[IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/UKC4y43.png)

**Had serious back problems**

The Reddit account was very active on r/Spondylolisthesis. According to Google, ""Spondylolisthesis is a condition where a vertebra in the spine slips out of place, usually in the lower back.""

This includes [this post](https://i.imgur.com/GRX4hhD.png) where he listed athletic success stories as motivation to other people suffering from the condition.

[Here's](https://www.foxnews.com/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-murder-suspect-luigi-mangione-complained-about-back-surgery-before-slaying) a news article that mentions Luigi Mangione's back problems. 

**Aggravated injury due to surfing**

Last year (2023), the Reddit account says that they're 25M (again, age lines up) and says, ""I first aggravated my spondy 1.5 years ago after surfing."" [Image](https://i.imgur.com/0Mux0In.png)

This lines up with Luigi Mangione. The [following article](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/luigi-mangione-charged-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting/) says:

> CBS News has also learned Mangione had been living at a co-working, co-living space called Surfbreak in Honolulu up until 2022, when a spokesperson for that community says he left due to a lifelong back injury that was exacerbated by surfing and hiking.

> Sources tell CBS News back pain was a major factor in his life and appeared to be a source of pain and frustration for him.  

**Shared an interest in Agronomics**

According to Google, ""Agronomics is a London-listed company that invests in cellular agriculture, which is the production of agricultural products from microorganisms and cell cultures. Agronomics uses biotechnology, synthetic biology, and tissue engineering to produce proteins, fats, or tissues""

[Here is a post from Luigi's Twitter account talking about the company.](https://nitter.poast.org/PepMangione/status/[REDACTED_PHONE][REDACTED_PHONE]02#m)

Ton of comments from the Reddit account on r/agronomics, [here's an image of a few](https://i.imgur.com/dxglYEP.png).

**Lived in Hawaii at some point**

I don't know Luigi Mangione's entire life story, but the surfing thing occurred in Hawaii and his LinkedIn has his location as Hawaii. Well, in 2023 this Reddit account commented on r/Oahu that he loves stargazing at ""Ke'ana Point"". Here's an [image](https://i.imgur.com/7mGJHuY.png). That's in Hawaii.

## Takeaways

Okay, now that we know that it's him... what does the Reddit account tell us?

Here are some things that I noticed from its comment history.

**He's a kind guy**

Most of his Reddit activity is on r/Spondylolisthesis and it's rather uninteresting in the sense that it's... mostly just him being nice to other people, giving them advice and motivation.

Here are some quotes from r/Spondylolisthesis specifically.

- ""You'll do great, whatever you decide. [...] We can't be afraid to live our own lives to the fullest!""
- ""Of course. Also feel free to DM me if you have any questions in the future""
- ""Sorry you're also a member of this shitty club, but know that you'll be fine whatever you decide""
- ""Hope that helps and sorry you have to go through this""
- ""Surgery is scary, but the sooner you get past this, the better. Good luck with the neurosurgeon consult!""

Pretty mundane stuff, but with how much douchebaggery you see on the Internet, it's a breath of fresh air in a sense. Most of these are parts of longer comments where he gives detailed thoughts / advice, you can see those in the archive.

**Some of his interests include**

Football: he commented on r/nflmemes and r/fantasyfootball

Pokémon Go: he commented on r/pokemongo back in 2016, along with r/pokemongodev nd r/TheSilphRoad.

Flipping: he commented on r/Flipping and r/ThriftStoreHauls

Bioinformatics: he commented on r/bioinformatics

""One Bag"": he was active on r/onebag in 2024. According to the subreddit description, it is ""an 'urban' travel community devoted to the idea of helping people lug around less crap; onebag travel""

**He was struggling in more ways than one**

On top of his back problems, he commented on r/BrainFog, r/visualsnow, and r/ibs.

According to WebMD, ""Brain fog isn’t a medical condition. It’s a term used for certain symptoms that can affect your ability to think. You may feel confused or disorganized or find it hard to focus or put your thoughts into words.""

According to Wikpedia, ""Visual snow syndrome (VSS) is an uncommon neurological condition in which the primary symptom is that affected individuals see persistent flickering white, black, transparent, or colored dots across the whole visual field.""

And IBS is irritable bowel syndrome.

And for what it's worth, the brain fog activity was in 2018, before COVID (it's apparently a reported symptom of COVID).

Here's a neat snippet of a long form comment on r/BrainFog during his time at UPenn six years ago.

> Working through the degree has certainly been tougher than anything I ever even thought I could handle. Granted, I went from almost entirely A’s at a tough school to just passing my classes and not understanding anything while putting in probably twice the amount of work.

> Funny how you mention strategy games. Last year when it all started, I used to play chess daily against my roommate. I used it as a metric to see how the brain fog was improving. Eventually, I just stopped since I could never remember any strategy. He would use the same moves against me day after day and I just wouldn’t remember them.

> I think it helps to latch onto something for motivation. My choice to study CS and Bio wasn’t completely random - after spending so much time with brain fog, I’ve come to realize how little is understood about it, and I’d love to change that. Once I get past this, I hope to at least help a few of the people on this sub.

[Here's an image of the whole comment](https://i.imgur.com/aXFr7If.png).

**Miscellaneous**

There are two other random Reddit comments he had outside of his usual subreddits that I found somewhat interesting.

Both of these comments were on an r/facepalm post from April 2024 about Elon Musk having a transgender daughter.

One specific comment thread made fun of Musk for being high on ketamine, and then a random Redditor basically argued that people should be more open minded about substances that can be used to treat depression. The comment was downvoted, and Mangione replied ""Weird double standard by reddit here regarding treatments for depression. Now sure how this is being downvoted"". [Image here](https://i.imgur.com/d3ySr6U.png). There is some evidence on Mangione's Twitter defending drug use as well, including psychedelics.

This other exchange was on the same post about Musk. 

- A user commented ""Feels pretty silly to not believe there is at least some social contagion element at play."" They sit at -58 points on this comment.

- A person replied ""I grew up really religious and still turned out trans. Just took me years of depression because my family wouldn't accept. No one ever talked about trans people.""

- Original commenter said ""DID I SAY TRANS PEOPLE DONT EXIST FOR FUCKS SAKE? This is why no one can have a conversation. 10 downvotes and been reported already for saying there might be some aspect of growing trans population resulting from social contagion. Fuck me, I guess I’m just satan.""

- There was a long back-and-forth between these two fellas, as Reddit tends to go, but at this point Mangione's account replied and said: ""This is one of the crazier comment threads I've seen on reddit, that reminds me how much of an echo chamber this site is. How the hell are you being reported for merely suggesting that both ""nature"" and ""nuture"" play roles in human behavior. Literally nothing bigoted or controversial about that statement.""

## The elephant in the room

The obvious questions: Did he talk about healthcare? UHC? Brian Thompson?

No bomb shells, exactly.

In 2018, in a thread on r/IBS, a user asked him if insurance covered a test that Mangione received from his doctor.

Mangione's account responded that ""BCBS covered my test"". [Image](https://i.imgur.com/Mjj4XM8.png)

Now, that was six years ago, but for what it's worth, BCBS is ""Blue Cross Blue Shield"". They are NOT United Healthcare (UHC). They're actually the company that recently received criticism for a newly announced anesthesia payment policy and ended up reversing it in light of Brian Thompson's death. [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/anthem-blue-cross-blue-shield-time-limits-anesthesia-surgery-rcna183035)

This doesn't really mean anything because it was six years ago.

The only other somewhat adjacent thing that I found was a comment in response to a post where somebody asked for help convincing a surgeon that they needed spinal fusion surgery because their pain is unbearable.

Mangione's account gave multiple suggestions, including: ""Tell them you are ""unable to work"" / do your job. We live in a capitalist society. I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life."" [Image of the full comment](https://i.imgur.com/B3w4X0u.png).

## Conclusion

It would be silly for me to tell you not to blindly trust the media and then tell you to blindly trust me. So do your own research if you're interested. The links at the top of the post will allow you to do so.

My take?

Kind-hearted, smart kid. Suffered from a host of problems, far more than anybody, let alone a young man in their 20s should deal with.

According to his Reddit activity, he suffered from:

- Debilitating back pain
- Irritable bowel syndrome
- Brain fog
- Visual snow

Nonetheless, he came to Reddit to help others with the same problems and give them the same motivation that seemed to help him.

I won't speculate on why he did what he did for the sake of objectivity, but I hope people engage on the topic with a better sense of who he might've been, because there will certainly be an attempt to paint him in a specific way.",30304,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to surprise her with taylor swift concert tickets, since i knew she really wanted to go. I called in sick the day the tickets dropped and waited in the ticket master cue for 2 hours. finally when it opened up, i bought two seats, for 400 dollars each, presumably one for her, and another for me. When she came back from work that night i surprised her with the tickets, and she was ecstatic. However, when I claimed i was excited to go with her, she got very confused and claimed she thought the two tickets were for her and her best friend, (who is also a big Taylor swift fan). I was very disappointed since I believed that this was an experience we could do together and it would be something we would remember for the rest of our lives. My girlfriend could tell I was upset and said she would be happy to go with me instead. I told her she should go with whoever she wanted to go with more, and to not go with me just because it was what i had planned. After hearing this my girlfriend immediately called her friend and told her that they were going to the taylor swift concert together (ouch). I told my girlfriend that if her friend wanted to go with her she had to pay the 400 dollars for the ticket and her friend agreed to. While my girlfriend and her friend went together and both had a great time I felt betrayed since she chose her over me. While i know my girlfriend’s bff is a much bigger taylor swift fan than me, i was still excited to go since i’ve never been to a concert before, and i like to listen to some of taylor swifts songs.

1fur2zx,1727903181,10/2/2024 21:06,self,How do I tell a girl my biggest insecurity before we have sex,"So I recently started going out with an amazing girl. We hit it off immediately. Bear in mind I have alot if trouble with dating due to my situation-

My situation in question is this:

When I was a newborn, i had a severe case of hypospadias, which is basically where the opening of the urethra in low on the shaft of the penis. But in combination with this condition, in the womb my testicles had fused with my penis causing my parents to have to make a decision for me as a newborn that I would have never made myself. They chose to have my testicles removed versus having me go through multiple stages of dangerous surgeries when I was very young. Due to the hormonal imbalance of this before getting prescribed testosterone as a teen, my penis is well below average (~2.8in) and it makes me feel like less of a man. 

So my dilemma is this:
How do i explain this to this amazing woman im going out with in a way that doesn’t make me sound wildly insecure about it(which I am), because in my head as soon as I tell her, she will want nothing to do with me. 

One of my biggest dreams in life is to have a family and be a father, but I know that it will never be MY child(by blood), which I have accepted, but explaining this to someone new hurts to even think about. I dont want to be looked at as less of a man, or as someone who cant provide her with what she wants. 

EDIT1: i just wanted to say thank you to every single person who has commented, dmed, or reached out. The immense support im feeling helps me more than you know. Im sorry i havent been able to respond to every message(kinda hard when theres 1500+), but if you really want to reach out, or are a parent who needs advice with their kid(ive had a couple reach out) my dms are open. I will update this thread once I tell her. 

EDIT2: Well, i told her. Needless to say, it went amazing. I guess in my head i had a bad idea of what would happen because of the way my last gf reacted. This woman comforted me, told me it wasnt an issue at all and we would work through it, and then messaged me after i left saying how much it meant to her that i told her and trusted her like that. I think now i can start planning on asking her to be my girlfriend. Thank you everyone for the support and kind words. I feel completely loved by complete internet strangers.

My girlfriend has always teased me about Teddy but I never minded. I understand how it's not usual for a grown adult to keep stuffed animals in their room.

I came back and found Teddy missing. I looked everywhere but I knew that he wouldn't have moved on his own. When I asked my her she said that she threw him out while she was cleaning up because I am [REDACTED_NAME] old to own toys. She also found it weird that he was just always there looking at us while we slept.

I admit that I probably overreacted but I told her to leave and not come back unless she had Teddy with her. She went to her mom's and has not come back so Teddy is gone for good.",17293,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve always just not been very hungry, and food for a long time was just something I handled at the end of the day with an average sized meal the majority of my adult life. As a kid, in my first household I snuck a lot of food to my dog since I was often averse to my only option, and then in the second household I just ate whatever from the pantry at night. 

I’ve been into sports a long time, mainly swimming. But lately I’ve decided to get more into weightlifting, and over the past year I’ve been really trying to focus on slowly improving in basic self-care stuff. Taking daily meds, brushing teeth everyday, etc. 

Logging each and every thing I ate was something I’ve meant to do for a while, as I understand a big part of my exercise routine I’m missing is eating enough. But since I already knew it was low to start out, I first have been slowly upping my intake as much as I can, even past discomfort sometimes. 

Cue me finally deciding to add up my food for the day out of curiosity- I felt proud I had ate so much more than normal, and thought maybe I would have met the actual recommended amount. 

My “a lot” was fucking 1350… Oof. 

Not looking forward to how uncomfortable it’s probably going to be to push it even more than I did today. Nor am I sure how to do so. If anyone knows how to make oneself more hungry, I’m all ears. ",217,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was in charge of counting the tills at closing, so I had easy access to the money.

Back then the menu was simple, and most people ordered the combos. We had a price chart and calculator beside the drive through register to help with the total. We’d tell the customer their total, then ring up a small coke or coffee to open the till, make change, and leave the extra in the box. When I pulled the register, I would take out the exact amount of what the report said it should have, then keep the extra that we had scammed.

Okay, buckle up because I swear this sounds like a Wattpad story, but it actually happened.

About a 7 year ago, I 25 was *madly* in love with my best friend (let’s call him Sam). We had one of those painfully close friendships where everyone assumed we were already together. I had written a long, emotional message one night where I finally poured out everything how I’d fallen for him, how I couldn’t keep pretending to just be friends, and how terrified I was to lose him if he didn’t feel the same.

The plan was to sit on it, proofread the next day, and *maybe* send it after a bottle of courage. Instead, sleepy-me hit send… not to Sam… but to my classmate *Dan* a guy I barely knew outside of group projects.

Cue the full-body panic. I immediately tried to unsend it, but it was too late. Dan had read it. Then came his reply:

""Wow. I don’t think this was meant for me... but if it *was* I feel the same way.""

I was *mortified*. I explained the situation, apologized, and tried to laugh it off, but Dan wasn’t joking. He said my message made his heart race. That he had noticed me for months. That maybe fate was being weirdly generous.

We went for coffee a few days later just to clear the air. That ""coffee"" lasted 5 hours. We haven’t stopped talking since.

I never did confess to Sam. We drifted naturally, and I realized maybe the idea of him was bigger than the reality. Meanwhile, Dan has been my safe place, my partner, my person for 7 whole years.

Life is *so* weird. But sometimes, the wrong message finds the right person.

**TL;DR:** Tried to confess to my best friend. Sent it to a random classmate by accident. We’re now celebrating our 3-year anniversary.

fpgr65,1585247159,3/26/2020 18:25,self,"How growing up in a cult broke me (trauma story, trigger warning!)","This is a very,very long read. 


Hello, to someone who might read this. 

It feels weird to do this but I want to tell my story to people who might understand. 
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] professionally diagnosed but I definitely have deep emotional and mental problems. Please don't tell me to seek out professional help. I want to have therapy so so bad. I know that I need help, but for now it's not possible, because if I would ask my parents they would tell me I should pray to god and he would fix the ""phase"" I have. 

But I assure you, as soon I get the opportunity to seek out professional help, without my parents knowing I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to. 
As long as that is impossible I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to figure out what is going on with me on my own. 

I did so much research during quarantine because I started to question my sense of self, especially my identity and endet up having an internal crisis.

 I thought my issues weren't that deep, because I never was physically abused and technically everything in my life was fine. I had clothes, food and an overall loving family (on the surface). And I played it down because I thought: someone like me can't call their experiences trauma, because I was never hit nor bullied. 

Generally people liked me (because I was a massive people pleaser and still do it but it's gotten better) or at least they were nice to me. My parents supported me, helped me out when I needed money for something. 

And now there are two parts of me fighting. 
The one part that knows exactly how f*cked up I really am and the other part that tells me I'm [REDACTED_NAME], that I should stop overthinking and stop being ungrateful. 

Im torn and I hope to find at least one person who kind of understands me. 
I feel like no one could ever get me. 
Because my ""trauma"" doesn't feel validated. 
Even though I found out that the part of the brain that is responsible for physical pain is also responsible for emotional pain. 

It still feels like I don't deserve to be heard. 
Because on the surface everything was perfectly fine. 

And even though I talked to friends about it and they really helped me, they still told me to be grateful that I was well liked and no one directly hurt me. But I can't. I can't look at the positive aspects and live normally. 

It affects my life. It affects the person I am. It shaped me. I can't concentrate (and it got worse and worse with time), I have emotional outbursts that I learned to hide, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on guard and don't feel safe in my house (because I constantly think my parents could find out something that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] fro them), I can never relax no matter where I am (except when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my boyfriends house and I know no one is going to be at home for a longer period of time), I feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] worth it, I feel ugly on the inside and outside, and I hate myself for coping by overeating (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] obese nor anything near it, but if I continue to eat how I eat without going to the gym it could happen), I feel like I have to be the main mother-figure to my sisters because my mum so is emotionally detached that I don't want them to think that what she does is real love. 

But the worst thing is how distant I feel from my emotions and myself. Does a ""myself"" even exist? Can I ever be ""it""? I feel numbed out and drained, even though I do nothing all day but distracting myself as good as I can. 

I feel like I never achieved anything and that I never will. 

Everything is overwhelming and so hard to do, even the littlest homework or task. 
That's why I have a pile of work in my e-mails and in the back of my mind that stresses me the hell out. But I just can't get myself to do it unless it has a deadline (and even then I tend to it last minute). 

I feel weak, stupid and misunderstood and I think to myself: if that continues all my good marks are going to drop. And then my parents are going to be a problem even on the surface. 

Im doing my A-Levels (class of 2021) in Germany (I was born here) right now and I just feel like I can't do it. And it is required from me that I get prestigious degree. Even though I would rather pursue a singing career. 

That was the longest introduction I ever wrote, but it needed to be at least written down somewhere. 

So, what is the big deal? What am I complaining about?

 (I'll try to create a chronological order and to remember everything crucial but I yesterday realized that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] blocks of time in my memories even from recent times.) 

It all started even before I was born. 
My parents found each other through friends and got together. 

My mum lived in Kazakhstan before moving to germany (I still don't exactly know why) and my father lived in Siberia before moving to Germany (his and my uncle's parents wanted to prevent them from having to fight in a war zone) and so they happened to live in the same city and then met.
They got together and married. 

Then their neighbors invited them to go with them to a Russian-German evangelical church and they ended up being members. 

Then I was born and everything was perfect. I was in church every Sunday from the moment my mother could leave the hospital. 
I never knew anything different. 

And as soon as I was able to be separated from my mother for 2-3 hours I was with other children in my age while the adults were attending the ""big"" service. 

And then the indoctrination started. 

I don't remember much from my time in church (or the cult as I call it now) from the time before I was 12. I only remember my time in school. Which is very odd to me, but what do I know? 

I just remember being a people pleaser from the start and everything they taught us but there aren't much of clear memories. I was good at being a people pleaser. 
Now it's easy for me to approach people and connect on a surface level. 
But at what price? 

It's scary to me that my memories are so blurry. 
I don't even know who I was friends with, or if I even had friends (before the age of 10).

I just remember that I wanted to be perfect in god's eyes. I wanted to be the perfect example of a girl who loves Jesus with all her heart. 
I wanted people on church to look at me and think that I will make it far in my faith. 
And I achieved that, I think. 

But now I hate my past self for caring so much.
 
So what where we taught there? 
God created the world, Jesus died for my sins and resurrected after three days, the Bible is the only truth and the only way I must live (everything else is the devil's work) and even though they didn't say it in particular but that our church is the only one to teach the ""real"" truth and that every other church doesn't have god in it and immediately leads to hell and damnation. 

We were taught that the secular world was highly dangerous and as soon as were not following one of god's (the church's) rules, were open for demons to attack us. And to make it short: you could sin by thinking something.

 So we were taught to somehow control our thoughts but give full control to god, over every little aspect in our live, because everything is predestined and we don't have control about anything anyways. 

But we're still responsible for our actions somehow and still have a ""free will"" granted from god. 

While writing this I really understand how contradicting this is. 
And it was a core beliefe of mine. 

When an adult who looked after you as a toddler tells you this and there are 500 people who all believe it wholeheartedly, you try to justify it until you really can't anymore. 
And then everything shatters. 

Losing faith in something that was so deeply intertwined with your whole existence is like a part of you just died. Even though you know how ridiculous it was believing in it and you still feel stupid for not realizing it earlier. 

So in a nutshell everything bad you do is because you're not saved (because for someone who is ""really"" saved it's physically impossible to sin no matter how) and automatically fully your fault. But when you achieve something it's because god did it. 

You're never capable of doing or achieving something on your own. You're even unable to think in the ""right, good way"". So you're basically nothing and unimportant. 

But when you come to god, he gives you a purpose he specifically chose for you, you matter to him, you're worthy of his love (and even though we were taught he is forgiving to everyone and (almost) everything) if you only follow him everywhere he leads you. 

Another bizarre contradiction they teach little children: you're nothing but with god you're worthy. 
It makes me unbelievably mad that there are gradually more and more children who grow up believing this. 

Who are taught that demons, the devil and hell are around every corner to take them and torture them for eternity if they slip up one tiny bit. 

That's why I cried myself to sleep for years begging god to forgive me for saying ""sh*t"" one time or thinking in my head that I wanted to kiss a boy, not speaking of being attracted to a girl. 

Because of course anything then straight marriage within my church is wrong (yes I was expected to have a boyfriend within church and if he was in the ""world"" I had to convince him to go to church and he has to love god). 

We weren't allowed to date before 17 and of course no premarital s*x. But they took it further to prevent it all costs. You weren't allowed to be alone in a room with your s.o. Before marriage so nothing could possibly happen. Holding hands and short hugs were allowed when engaged. 

So if you grew up there, find a boyfriend and get engaged as fast as possible (because if you ""fall in love"" it must be gods plan) because you wanna f*ck, and then marry as fast possible (you had to be together at least a year and then be engaged for at least half a year) to have your first kiss ever (if you weren't sinful) I front of everybody when the pastor says: you may kiss the bride. 

We were taught that god wants us to be pure and learn to value our partner's personality. 
They told us girls that if we had a sexual relationship before marriage you would never know if he really loves you or just wants your body. And that every guy outside church would never love us for our personalities.

Another contradiction. These young adults rush into marriage not because they think ""wow I really value my partner as a person"". 
No, they're s*x-driven teenagers lying to themselves (which is absolutely not their fault of course). 

No one is appreciating anything. 
And if they are, they're VERY lucky. 

Because there were maybe 15 people in your age range that you could end up with. 

Girls were also taught to save themselves because we are like chewing gum. 
And if you're all chewed up, your godly future husband wouldn't want you, wouldn't he? 

We were told we were pure glasses of water. 
And if we sleep around before marriage, or even with only one person, every time dirt would fall into our pure water. And no one wants to drink dirty water. 

But the one thing that stuck with me that my mother (and later on more older women) told me was: every time you sleep with a man, he takes a part of your soul with him. That's why there should be only one guy from the start. 

So that you don't end up losing your soul. The thought of that terrified me to the core and I believed it. 
Now I know it's bullsh*t but it was in my head constantly for 5-6 years. 

We were told to cover up so guys don't sin with their eyes and thoughts. Knee-length skirts and shorts were allowed (and I always hated how they looked on me) and you had to cover your belly and your shoulders at all cost. Cleavage was obviously not allowed and so weren't tight clothes (only skinny jeans, not leggings). Especially when you had a little bit more chest. 

And if you dared to show a little tiny bit of skin (no matter how hot summer was) even if it was accidental, you'd get in trouble for it.

I was in that godforsaken building almost everyday. Except for Wednesdays where we would meet up with our local little group of girls (there was a leader a few years older then us and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] mine wasn't as controlling as others and didn't force me too much to work in different groups in church) and discuss what our beloved (I could vomit remembering him and his sleazy and narcissistic behavior) pastor taught us last Sunday. 

I was involved in worship (and my love for singing kind of saved me because that's the only thing I really did because I myself wanted it) I danced (which was ok it was workout for me and not dancing for god when I think about it) I looked after toddlers once month during service (with other women) I was in the theater group and when there was an event for teenagers I was responsible for leading a group of other teenagers to organize it so everything was done and standing where it belongs (I liked organizing, so I was lucky they just positioned me there but it still was hella stressful). And I played the piano(which I didn't really enjoy). 

So there are the Basics. I was heavily involved. 

With 12 you move from being with children to the ""big"" service and you're finally old enough to be part of all the cool things the teenagers did. 

But then you're also constantly stressed out which worsened every year because obviously school got harder, but also church demanded more and more and suddenly you were thrown into highly responsible tasks which drained you. 

When I was 14 I started to constantly have headaches. I started drinking coffee because I was exhausted of not being able to sleep, being stressed out and constantly worried that someone would find out my secrets. (And now I need a very strong one for it to ""work"".)

Because in school I was someone else. I had a different name in school (my real name). In church the pastor required my parents to introduce me with a very far away nickname from my real name because it sounded like a name in the Bible that an evil person had and if I'd be called that it would curse me. 

I did and said what I wanted (it increased gradually because I still tried to be ""myself"", which you could be in church (no),  in school but obviously couldn't do that, because no one can ). 

I thought I was being myself I school and maybe that was ""myself"" when I was 14 but I still was the most severe case of a people pleaser. 

And I always endet up in dependent toxic friendships because I could never say anything against them. I had no one else who was close to me. So that also hurt me even though I didn't notice at the time. 

People abused my kindness, because in church they told us we had to be nice. And I could do at least that. So I held on to being nice to everyone, helping everyone and inviting people to come to church who were remotely close to me. Which still embarrasses me the most, but you get in trouble when you're not inviting people. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] glad I was in a very accepting class. No one was ever really bullied, just mocked for a few things, maybe. 
Which I was for being in that ""church"". 
And they told me early on: it's a cult, you believe in crazy sh*t, stop going there. 
But we were taught that people who are afraid of the truth always say that. 

School was kind of a safe place for me, even if I had toxic friendships and got hurt a few times, because we live about 25 kilometers away from church (the cult lol) and no one I knew from there could see me. 
And even though we were taught that god could see EVERYTHING and is always reading our thoughts I didn't feel very watched (I was scared sh*tless when I wore something in school we weren't allowed to wear in church and I thought I saw someone I knew) so I felt better in school then at home. 

And that's why my definition of ""home"" is something entirely different then that of people who grew up in an emotionally safe home. 

So what was living in my ""home"" like? 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] first daughter of three and therefore my fathers precious first born. I learned really fast that just keeping quiet, smiling and doing what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] is the best way to avoid any more stressful situations. I hated every form of confrontation and I still do.

When I was as young as 3 my father threatened to hit me with a belt (and did it a few times) but I stopped misbehaving or questioning so no one yelled at me anymore and no one told me to stand in a corner without looking around. 

So I just learned to not show my emotions at all at ""home"". Because emotions cause trouble and distress. They also told us that. God and our own intellect (which is controlled by god) must lead us. Emotions come out because of the devil. 

My father was in control of everything and to this day he's still extremely, s*xist, r*cist, homophobic, transphobic etc. You name it. 
And he still thinks I have exactly the same opinions as him. 

He is very critical of my boyfriend, but because he puts on a facade in front of my father as I do my father likes him. 

My parents (more my father) still don't want me to have anything premarital, even though they are less strict then before. So yeah I can't ask for birth control because then they would not let me see my bf. 

As I said my father is very controlling and has a very high opinion of himself. Because he is providing for our family he doesn't have to do anything regarding the house. This is on the woman and the four girls in his house, because that's what god made us for. 

Popping out babies, cleaning und cooking. 

But I still have to have a degree and a high paying job. 

And then I ask myself: what do you want from me? What? 

In church we learned that you have to find a job that gives you enough time to be as active as possible in church while giving birth to as many children as possible and managing your whole household completely alone. 

Because your husband is by god's law above you and there to ""lead"" you. How remarkably generous of you to lead me, because I can't decide on anything ever due to always thinking I don't have control anyways. 

That's why I need to plan everything obsessively and always know and control what's going on.

I idolized my father until the realization that we don't have any emotional bond slowly reached me until it hit me hard. 

I had to organize my phone a certain way and delete massages so in case he would want to go through it he wouldn't find anything. 

He wanted me to be his perfect show-daughter who has good marks and serves god with all of her existence. And he really did that. 
In front of him I am [REDACTED_NAME] he wants me to be. 

I don't know what my mother wants. She just does what my father tells her and silently agrees to what he has to say. Maybe I learned to behave in that way because she did. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sorry for her because she never had a chance to study anything that could make her independent, because of moving to Germany with 17 or 18 and not being able to speak the language very well. 

I could cry, because, no matter how brutal this sounds, her life is over in a way. She is what I never want to be. 

Whenever they told us how our future will look like I had a kind of panic that I never felt before. At the time I suppressed that but when I think back my heart rate goes up and I feel like I need to run as fast as I can. 

And that's why I hate to be dependent on someone. But weirdly I still end up in situations where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] dependent. 

Another thing that I can maybe explain now is my reaction to my grandfathers death (he was more of a father to me then my own and his and his wife's home (which I also deeply loved) felt safe). 

When I was 11 years old my grandmother (my grandfathers wife) passed away because of cancer. And I was never allowed to see her while she was sick nor to attend the funeral. 

And in that time I already saw my grandpa rarely. When my parents told me my grandma passed away I cried one time.

I know that I was sad but I somehow can't really recall my immediate emotions from that day. 

And I thought I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that I still have my grandpa. But he passed away three months later. And I wasn't able to see him during these months. When my father (emotionlessly) told us that his father also passed away I felt nothing. I didn't cry. No reaction at all. And then I didn't think about it for years. 

But when I was 14 all of the sudden all of the emotions I should have felt when I was 11 crushed me harder then anything ever. 

It was like reliving the day I was told he was gone for ever for almost a year. And I was so confused. Why now? Why didn't I feel anything back then? Because my brain was already way to stressed for an 11 year old and just didn't process properly. 

Then three years later something triggered my memories and the horrors began. 

When I was 16 it hit me again because I found out he committed s*icide (through my cousin). 

Back to the cult. 
So am I still there? No. 

My parents realized how manipulative literally everything about it was and without telling anyone there (childhood friends I grew up with included) we went there one last time and on Sunday the 23rd September [REDACTED_ADDRESS]ove away and never came back. 

And many others left too. 
We still meet every Sunday and I still sing there, because I don't want to confront my parents.
 
I really don't want to be there because every time we're there I'm [REDACTED_NAME] really there. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a shell that moves around. During the preaching (which a few men do in turns) I'm [REDACTED_NAME] completely zoned out and can only concentrate for a bit if I really really try. 

I don't know what that is or that means but I absolutely hate it because I can't control it. 

And sometimes I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sad for no reason, I still can't sleep and still get a massive headache and can't stand up properly without strong coffee. I still eat too much stuff really shouldn't and I feel bad for every little bit I eat. But I can't stop. 

And it also affects all of my relationships, especially with my bf. He sometimes doesn't understand but he still comforts me and is patient which I am [REDACTED_NAME] grateful for. 

And something that comes to my mind only now is that my father used to completely lose it when I had a bad mark. I was afraid to come home and always started crying before even telling him. And then he would shout even more, beat the table with his fist and tell me to stop crying. 

Now I can control if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to cry or not when something upsets me. And if I want to show my emotions or not. Being a very good liar was essential and it still is.

When my father is mad at me because I didn't do the dishes he still gets very impulsive and shames me because if he works and gives me food and clothing it's disrespectful to leave the dishes for too long. And when he stands beside me and doesn't stop while I do the dishes I just nod my head and say yes. It's the only way to avoid more pain at all costs. 

There are these moments but also the ones where he tries to talk to me and asks me how I am [REDACTED_NAME] then he tells me how he loves his first born princess. He tells that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] best daughter someone could have and that he's so so proud of me. And I just smile at him and say thank you. 

But on the inside I think: ""if you knew who I really am and what I did that you don't of, you wouldn't talk to me anymore"". 

He is proud of the daughter he created for himself that I still am in front of him. 

And also my mother tries to get closer to me after 16 years of distance and letting the church raise us. And the only thing that I would tell her if I was honest for a few seconds in the midst of all the lies I protect myself with is: ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] but it's too late."" 

I don't have any emotional connection to my parents and I never had. 

The first 16 years of my life partly wasted. 
I feel like someone took my childhood from me. Even my memories are blurry. 
And I know it's technically not my parents fault but I want to blame them so badly. 

And it makes me so mad that I was born because of the ""church"". Because they convinced my father to have children. 
I was cursed before I even existed. 

And still. 

I can recall a few beautiful memories of things I did with my friends there. The sleepovers, summer camp, singing together, playing hide and seek in the big building. 

All of us connected through our fear of the dangerous outside world and hell. 

There is no moment in my life where I wasn't afraid that some adult could dream, or feel( they taught us that god can reveal things about people to you when you have strong connection to the holy spirit) that I  was a dirty sinner that acted differently in school.

And it was so frightening, because when it's out that you messed up you can't attend certain rituals( like the holy communion) and that's when people know. They see that you're not taking part in it and the first thing that comes to mind is of course ""premarital s*x!!!"" 

When a couple did it (and someone found out) it's made sure by the authorities that in a week everyone knows. 

And I wanted to avoid people thinking that at all costs so was very aware and on guard all the time.

 I made sure I had a different app also open while watching vampire diaries on my phone because there you can switch faster so my father or my mother (who still just burst into my room whenever they want to) would never know I would watch something the devil created.

 My parents and everyone in church who was ""responsible"" for me always tried to shelter me and get anything with a ""bad influence"" away from me. 

But I still watched what I wasn't allowed to. The internet and myself raised me when my beliefs started to break away. People like Jenna Marbles taught me things parents should teach their kids. I educated myself on so much stuff I missed out on and started to build my own opinions and morals from 14-16. 

Basic knowledge like: it's okay to not believe what your parents believe was so new to me.
 
And now? I just want to move out and study something so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] safe. I can't wait for the day where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to be financially independent and don't have to rely on my father.

Wow it feels good put all of that in words. 

When you read until now you must be really really bored, but thank you. I appreciate your attention greatly. 

I just wish I could get help.


update: I told my parents, because I realized I couldn't wait any longer (I was stubborn). 
So now i'm [REDACTED_NAME] to therapy.

My wife(now age 63) has a rare disease that  causes her not to ever make a new memory. Ever.
She literally can't remember anything for more than 10 seconds or so.
We write everything down in a notebook for her so she knows what's going on throughout the day.
It's incredibly hard, obviously for both of us.
We went from partners in everything to me being her care giver.
She'll ask a question  ('when do we shower?'), all tell her, and by the time I answer her, she's forgotten the question she asked me.
It's not all bad.
We live in the moment,  again literally. 
We go to movies, Broadway shows, vacations, etc. She's enjoys, then forgets immediately.

This is a memory I honestly wish I could forget, as I do not relate to the person I was at 15 whatsoever. Having moved on from my trauma and that toxic home situation, I have changed a great deal and I always try to be a very kind person. This still brings me guilt when I think about it, though.

Trigger warning (DV/SA/mention of SH)

Hi everyone,

My daughter recently turned 17 and it just hit me that it will only be one more year that we are legally tied to her father. I've been counting down the time since she was 3 and I would like to share our story. I will be very honest and won't try to sugarcoat my own stupid decisions along the way. It is a very long story and there is still so much more that wouldn't fit in here, but I don't know how I could make it any shorter. Please feel free to ask me anything. Maybe it can help some of you or give you a little bit of hope. Or just keep you from making the same mistakes. Or maybe I'm [REDACTED_NAME] yelling it out into the void. Here we go.

1997

I met my ex when I was 15, he was 21. He approached me and was very blunt about being intererested in me. I was an angsty teen, lonely, insecure and arrogant and he was challenging and charismatic and his interest in me made me feel good. Nobody was ever really interested in me before. We dated for a while, until his fiancé (that I didn't know of) called me on my 16th birthday out of the blue. 

I had gone out with him and his friends many times and found out they covered for him and one of them must have finally told her. The next day he convinced her that nothing romantic ever happened and I was basically stalking him (while me and my parents were on the phone with them), even though even my parents confirmed to her that he introduced himself as my boyfriend and was in our house many times. She believed him. I couldn't wrap my head around how someone could lie to my face like that, it felt so bizarre. I moved on.

2000/2001

I then met him again 3 years later, he pretended to want a friendship for a while, then tried to get back together with me, got mad when I refused because I had a boyfriend and left my life again for some years.

2006/2007

5 1/2 years later we met again online. We started writing every day and met in person after a month and the sparks were back. The bad memories felt so long ago, we were different people now. We started dating again, it felt like the greatest lovestory ever. He proposed fast and talked about how I was meant to be the mother of his children. I got pregnant within 5 months. He was happy first until realisation hit him, I guess - and he confessed that he was married and couldn't leave his wife for financial reasons. After lots of fights and tears I conceded and decided to play along for the sake of my child, who I already loved so much. She was born in early 2008.

2008/2009

We lived in 2 separate cities and for about two years he visited me every other weekend-ish. He kept telling me that his marriage and his wife were his business to handle and if I would interfere I would destroy everything. So I kept playing along and stayed out of it. He wasn't there when our daughter was born and he left me alone with our newborn child when I came home from the hospital with a flu and a 40°C fever.

He didn't pay child support, he wasn't available when I needed him (because I couldn't call him) and he got angry when I was desperate and burnt out and eventually broke down from the stress of being a single mother to a child with semi-chronic illnesses (she fortunately grew out of it), with no other real family anymore except for my low-contact sister who lives 4 hours away, no support system and no money, so I had to balance work and being there for my sick kid and everything else. I lived in an appartment he owned (bought with his wifes signature on the loan) and he made me pay rent. I basically made minus 500 bucks every month and couldn't even apply for government support because I would have had to name him and he gaslit me into thinking that that would destroy everything financially at that time if his wife found out. He told me to stop complaining about being overwhelmed because others do it too (I also realized years later I most likely had PPD). 

He expected me to be available for sex whenever he came over and didn't really care about my consent (yeah, it only clicked years later what that actually was..). I grew resentful. He became jealous of the new and only (female) friend I had (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] even bi), because we spent a lot of time together, helping each other with our kids.

2010

When our kid was 2 years old, I finally had enough and broke up with him. So then he decided the time was right to finally tell his wife. He came to me, told me he told everyone (including his parents who were incredibly mad at him for keeping their first grandchild a secret for two years) and expected me to jump right into playing happy family, like flipping a switch.

I tried for a while, thinking that that was all I ever wanted and he wasn't lying after all when he always promised we would be together one day. I finally won, right?

As much as I wanted to be happy, but realizing little things started grating on me. Like how now I could just easily take a shower if I needed to when he was there made me realize what he robbed me off. It started to get to me how much easier it could have been. But I decided to give it a try, now that I finally had him. 

He understood that I didn't want to move into a house with him and his parents right away, so he decided we should buy a house somewhere else. He found one he liked, a 1 1/2 h drive away from my job, in the middle of nowhere. I told him I would love to find the perfect place for both of us, but this was not it for me. 

He went absolutely crazy. He started spamming all my email-adresses, calling me the c-,b- and w-word and a liar and many other things. I was at work at the time and completely shocked by the sudden hate. To this day I don't know why this triggered him so hard.

Soon after I found out I was pregnant again. I went no contact after his attacks, but felt obligated to tell him and his tone shifted immediately. I told him I wasn't excited about having another child with him and he told me he would support any decision I would make. After some hard internal back and forth I decided to have an abortion. When I told him after it was done, he immediately switched back to being aggressive, only this time with more direct threats (very graphic violent ideations of what he would do to me, promising to destroy every part of my life), as well as contacting colleagues of mine he had never met and remembered the names of, to tell them in detail what a horrible person I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I unalived his baby. And he broke into my place, just to show me that he could. And then he evicted me from his appartment that I paid rent for.

So I took him to court for harrassment. That put me in more debt, but I got a restraining order and supervised visits at a neutral agency out of it and started to heal a little bit after all this chaos. No direct contact.

Until my sister's wedding a few months later. My kid was a flowergirl and one of the photos was so precious, so cute that I couldn't help but wanting to share this special moment with him. So I sent it to him and we started talking again. He apologized like nobody every apologized to me before. He wrote me a letter where it seemed like he read my mind and really understood deeply all the things he had done wrong. He was so sure I was the one. We decided to try one last time. Take it slow this time. I moved in with him 3 months later, into his house, with his parents. I told myself I wanted to give it one last shot, so I would at the very least never feel like I didn't try hard enough to give my kid a complete family.

As soon as I moved in, he lost all interest in me. He expected me to keep the house clean, cook, take care of our daughter and work, of course. I was the only breadwinner at the time. He was convinced providing the house we live in (that he inherited from his grandmother) was enough and spent his time gaming, doing some shady side business with people I didn't know or doing god knows what. 

During this time we/he used up my entire small inheritance (I got 10k right around the time he evicted me) on his debts and his unemployment. When the money was gone, he wanted me to ask my sister for money and I drew a very hard line. We fought a lot at that time. I worked nightshifts every weekend and stayed with a friend in the city from Friday to Monday, we lived about an hour away and I didn't like driving at night so much. When we got into a fight one evening I told him I wanted to leave. I was in the bedroom, packing. My kid with me. He started shouting, calling me names, mocking me. When I wanted to leave he blocked the door. When I tried to push through, he shoved me hard against the doorframe and I fell and hit my head. I'll never forget my kid screaming and crying in fear. She also still remembers (she was 3). He didn't let me go. He broke me a little bit more that night. I knew I needed to get out, but I didn't know how.

2011

One day when I came back home from work, I found long, coloured hair in our shower and in the bed that definitely wasn't mine. He presented some bs theory to brush it off and I knew something was up, but I knew I needed proof. When I confronted him he tried to gaslight me, called me crazy, saying that I was trying to break our family apart. I started investigating. Luckily (yes, really) one day he got into a little accident with my car and the inconsistencies of how it happened gave me some clues and I ended up finding his AP. I packed my kid and our most important stuff and left the same day while he was out.

When he found out he completely lost it. In a call he jumped back and forth from begging and offering to give me his house if I'd come back to promising to destroy me for taking his child away from him, often mid-sentence, sometimes laughing and shouting and crying at the same time. When I had to return for important documents and made his mother promise he wouldn't be there, he was waiting for me in the driveway with a knife in his hand. I was terrified and refused to enter the house.

I left and got a spot at a women's shelter. Words can not describe how guilty and relieved I felt when the social worker there assured me I could block him everywhere, we would proceed via official channels only and he could not take our child away from me because of that. And they helped me get my daughter into therapy to help her through this trauma. He tried to dictate his conditions to every single person he interacted with and the case worker said she never met anyone so assertive and aggressive and manipulative in her whole carreer, and she was dealing with DV-cases for over 30 years.

2012

After months of fights through third parties and court dates we started coparenting. He still wasn't paying any child support even though he did work at the time. He once told me on the phone that if I'd ever go after him officially for child support, he'd just keep on quitting his job (in our country my application would then be suspended). And when I tried he actually did. He said he didn't want me to have his money after I ruined him and that's obviously all I ever cared about.

So I started insisting on written communication only. He tried to scare/force me into verbal agreements for a while and attacked me constantly in an attempt to gain control back (and I had panic attacks every time I got a message from him), but I stood firm. No more unrecorded 1on1 conversations he could twist afterwards. 

I found an appartment in the city, found a daycare for my kid and found the grey rock method. My mental health was at rock bottom. I was happy to be out, but still scared and had panic attacks. I started having outbursts of uncontrollable anger and got scared of myself. And then I finally started therapy for myself. 

2013

It all calmed down slowly, but gradually and we both started seeing new people. The day he told me he had a new girlfriend (of course he tried to rub it in, thinking I would really still care) was one of my happiest at that time. I was releaved that he would finally focus on someone else and thankfully, that's exactly what happened. I did feel bad for his new victim, but I just didn have it in me to warn her. I had to make sure we were safe from him. 

2[REDACTED_PHONE]

Years went by and he had a new girlfriend every other year. They were all really nice, but never lasted long (he cheated on all of them) and those relationships were filled with drama. On our end we received the random, occasional outbursts when things went to shit in his life, over and over, but he knew I would fight back harder now and so it was all bark, no bite. Exhausting, but managable. 

We developed a routine for our daughter. He had her every other weekend and half of the holidays, but of course there were a lot of last-minute changes from his side, which I usually would agree to, because I had the capacity and I didn't care to be right, I just wanted as little as possible to do with him. Sometimes I felt like a coward, but I just decided to focus on having a good life with my kid with as little stress as possible.

At this point I have to say that the doorframe-incident was the only time our daughter ever saw him like that. Despite his many flaws he did try his best to be a good father for her. Believe me, it is not easy for me to admit that. He read books to her, he taught her how to ride a bike, he took her on daytrips and went to parent-teacher-conferences. He was sometimes a bit strict, but nothing out of the ordinary. And she had him wrapped around her finger. He adored her. I tell you this because I want you to understand why I tried my best to enable an unbiased relationship between the two. Sometimes she was annoyed by him, but overall she knew he loved her and cared about her. I kept his bad behaviour towards me away from her as much as possible. I saw what being abandoned by his dad did to my best friend's son and I was happy for my kid that she could grow up feeling loved by both parents. We found stability.

2019

My daughter started to make excuses and didn't want to visit him anymore. And then she confided in me. Some weeks back, she had caught him cheating on his girlfriend in texts on his phone. He was sexting with some random woman, she read in graphic detail what he wanted to do with her (my kid was 11). And she told his girlfriend and sent her screenshots.

When he found out he grabbed her and screamed in her face. He kept telling her that he could have rightfully hit her in that moment and she should be thankful he was a good enough man he didn't, even though she didn't deserve his restraint. He made her promise not to tell me because it wasn't my business and I would blow it out of proportion and make him the bad guy, as usual. The weekends after he kept repeating his threats to her every time she visited until she finally told me.

Hearing something like that was my greatest fear. I decided to be honest with her and share a little bit of my history with him. Just enough so she would understand that it was not her fault, but that was a very dark side of him she had only seen once before and never directed at her. I then explained our options: 

- taking it to court, making his behaviour public

- trying to talk it out

- grey rocking

We discussed the pros and cons and I made sure to let her know I would support her and fight for her and I would make sure he could never do that again. And we decided together grey rock him. We didn't reach out at all anymore. When he asked her to visit him, I told him she had plans, she was sick, she was invited to a birthday party, she had to study for tests etc. He tried to argue sometimes, but eventually gave up. 

At some point, after a series of rants from his side and trying to manipulate us with ominous threats of self-harm, I told him I wasn't available for that kind of bullshit anymore and he could always send me a letter if he needed something (like oldschool, with a stamp and stuff - he never did) and that I would block him now for good. And I did. 

He did try to use her as a messenger for a while, of course, but I shot that down real very fast. I stabilized financially and finally got a court order for child support. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] debt-free and haven't needed his financial support for years anymore, so all his payments are saved for my kid. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Independent. I'm [REDACTED_NAME].

2025

My daughter just turned 17.

She hasn't seen him or really talked to him in 5 years. She hasn't blocked him, but doesn't engage much either. She has accepted who he is and stays away from him. 

Of course she did some more therapy over the years and has grown into the most incredible person. She is a smart, kind, loyal, funny and bubbly kid. She's happy. She knows what she wants and has the best bullshit detector I have ever seen. She's confident and strong and silly. She trusts me and she loves spending time with me and that makes me so happy and thankful. 

She is the reason I wanted to write my story out for you. She's the best thing I've ever done and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] proud of her and proud of myself. I did it. We did it. We made it out and we found happiness. It was so hard, but it was worth the fight. She was worth every fight.

Sometimes I still can't believe that I really did it on my own, that we are safe and the memories come back. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with these moments. They are not wounds anymore, they are scars that are proof of how much stronger I am [REDACTED_NAME]. Most of the time I'm [REDACTED_NAME] overwhelmed with happiness and grateful for the life I was able to build. I did that! I made it! I found love (for real this time) and have been with my wonderful, supportive and kind husband for years now. My kid and him are best buddies. Life is good.

I want you to know that you CAN get out and have a good life. It may take years and you will keep making mistakes, but that is ok. Just focus on your yourself. You can continue healing. You deserve that. You can get there. Keep going. ❤️",5,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
