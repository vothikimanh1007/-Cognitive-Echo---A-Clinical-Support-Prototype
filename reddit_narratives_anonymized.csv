9tn5bc,1541186231.0,2018-11-02 19:17:11,offmychest,When I was 13 I kissed a 23 year old friend who I had a massive crush on. It fucked me up emotionally for years after.,"This is going to be long, but I’ll try not to ramble too much. Names are changed of course. 

I was 11 or 12 when I met Jacob and his sister Natalie. Natalie was 2 years older than me, but I was mature for my age, both mentally and physically, so the age gap wasn’t noticeable and we became friends. Her brother was 21-22 at the time, but he treated us like equals and we would all hang out together. 

Very shortly after meeting him, I developed a crush on Jacob. An intense, obsessive kind of crush. It makes me cringe now when I think back on it.

I spent a lot of time with the siblings, trying to get as close to Jacob as I could. Which wasn’t hard. He seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with me. The 3 of us were teaching ourselves German and had a lot of other similar interests. We had a good time together. 

Jacob and I spent a lot of time alone together too. Sometimes Natalie would get into a sulky mood and want to be alone, or her brother would annoy her and she’d storm off. I would stay and just hang out with Jacob. It was innocent, we were friends, not a big deal. But of course I was always thrilled to have one on one time with him. And internally I’d be lustily daydreaming of his lips on mine, his hands on me... you get the picture. I was obsessed. 

Looking back, I believe he had the same thoughts about me. Little things like how he’d get his sister to leave us, or ask if we wanted to go do something that he knew only I would want to do (like go feed the chickens, Natalie was lazy but I loved any excuse to go outdoors.) And he’d sit really close to me, often touching. He’d play wrestle me sometimes. I’d take his favorite spot or something else and he’d get playfully rough in taking it back. Oh, and he was always poking my ribs or back in order to make me jump and that would often lead to tickling as well. 

I didn’t realize it at he time, but he definitely wasn’t treating me like a platonic friend. Of course I desperately hoped that he’d see me as more than a friend, that we’d be madly and passionately in love forever. I knew about the age of consent, so I knew it was just a fantasy and I believed it was one sided. That is, until my family moved in with his. 

My family fell upon hard times when I was 13. Jacob and Natalie’s family had a farm with a small cabin they allowed us to move into. They needed to use the kitchen, since theirs was being remodeled. So they were in the cabin with us a good portion of the day. 

Ended up getting closer to Jacob. I’d help with all the animal chores and we’d goof off outside too. He’d chase me around for fun and tackle me when he caught up. One time I remember he had me pinned down, his face right up in mine. I thought he might kiss me, but eventually the tension broke and we went on like normal. That was about when I started thinking maybe I wasn’t the only one with a crush. 

There was another time I crashed my bike and the seat scraped up my inner thigh area. He was so concerned and attentive and bandaged me up. Looking back, of course it was inappropriate. But I thought it was sweet and loving and I was starting to feel like he liked me.

Well, things continued on like this for a while longer. I was definitely getting the sense that he liked me and there was a lot of sexual tension. I guess I thought that soon he’d confess his feelings and we’d be together despite the age difference. Of course that’s not what happened at all. 

The night before my family was moving to another state temporarily, we all watched a movie together in the cabin. I was sad to be leaving and just wanted to be be close to Jacob a little longer. So I pretended to fall asleep against his shoulder. Jacob decided to stay and let me “sleep” since I had to be up early to leave the next day. My mom went to sleep in the chair near us. Jacob fell asleep or pretended to. I gradually fell further into him. We were straight up cuddling at this point. Bit by bit, I “naturally” adjusted my position until my face was close to his. I don’t know what I was thinking. Maybe that he’d wake up and wouldn’t be able to resist me any longer. I read a lot of cringy teen romance books. I was too afraid to make a move though, I wasn’t certain I was right about him having feelings for me. So I continued moving closer in tiny increments until our faces were touching. I think he was slowly moving closer as well. And then one more move and our lips touched. Both lying still and “asleep.” After a few moments like this, I felt a little movement in his lips, and we started kissing. It was just a slow, very gentle kiss. Both of us still barely moving. I was afraid to push things too far and get rejected. He was probably afraid of being found out as a child molester. So neither one of us let things get heavy enough that we couldn’t still claim we’d been asleep and it was unintentional. I got a little braver and let my mouth open a bit. Our tongues touched briefly. Then the kiss tapered off and we slipped back to sleep, or the stillness of pretending to sleep. 

The next morning as he hugged me goodbye, he held on extra long and planted the lightest little kiss on my head. 

After the initial ecstasy wore off, I started driving myself crazy. Unsure that it had even happened. I started doubting myself. Thinking maybe he had truly been asleep and unaware. And then the guilt. Because I knew what I had done. I was conscious. What if he hadn’t been? Maybe I imagined his participation. I beat myself up over it for many, many months. And then eventually I blocked the memory out. I think this event is what caused a spiral of depression, self loathing and insecurities in my teenage years. 

My family came back just a month after the kiss and ended up living with Jacob’s family again for over a year. We never spoke of what happened. He was just as friendly with me and still a little inappropriately so. But nothing ever happened again. Eventually he got a girlfriend who moved in and we grew more distant. I was jealous and heartbroken. And I felt more delusional and pathetic than ever. By the time I was 15-16 I put him out of my mind. But I had a whole set of unhealthy mental issues and destructive habits in exchange. 

I’m about to be 24 and I haven’t seen him in about 7 years, but I doubt it would affect me. I’ve made peace with all this. I can see now that he was a pedophile. And while I did encourage his behavior, I was absolutely not the only one acting inappropriately. I don’t blame myself anymore. But until now, it’s still been an ugly, uncomfortable secret I’ve had to live with. Writing this out and sharing my story is just me hauling this dusty box of disturbing memories from a dark corner of my mind, and placing it on the curb.

If you’ve gotten this far, opened the box and rifled through, I wouldn’t mind a kind word or two. But even if no one finishes this lengthy story, I still feel better having gotten it off my chest.

Before you continue reading, first this is a repost of my trauma. I talked about this before in other sub-reddits. It did greatly help navigate my feelings of being depressed, self isolation, and thoughts of wanting to self harm, but unfortunately those feelings are back and I feel as if they are stronger and worse than before. I've been going through some major life challenges and been having suicidal thoughts/self worth images. But I promise I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to do anything and actively started therapy recently. Before I talk to my therapist about this, I wanted to put it here first, to eventually read this to her after once I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. 

Apologies if any typos or grammatical errors. While I did mostly copy and paste the original story below from the other Sub-reddits, this is months of slowly verbalized thoughts and reflection on what I wrote, that also includes things I either forgot to add, or trauma I later remembered. I did make some needed edits and more descriptive words/expanded on some of the events that happened. I am [REDACTED_NAME] more detailed and in depth than the original post because I intend to read this to my therapist. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] saying everything I can recall will help me make steps in progressing into my much needed recovery and properly navigate feelings, thoughts, and actions. I did another re-read to confirm edits, and it brought up so many emotions that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] having a hard time going through this, even through multiple reading sessions. My head and heart is still racing and it's hard to focus on making sure my thoughts and feelings are well described and conveyed. 

The Story:

Hi everyone,
I'm ""D"" (25M) and I really wanted to talk about what I went through when I was younger. This is me being extremely vulnerable and honest

Little about me to provide context and help with the rant, I lived in a VERY strict household that was also EXTREMELY religious. My father was extremely abusive both mentally and physically. We literally weren't allowed to speak unless spoken to when my father was in the same room. Personality wise, I was much more closed up and quiet even before the trauma. Always been afraid of interactions from anyone and soft spoken. Didn't like asking for help since I always felt like a burden. We also had issues with finances and because of that, modern luxuries we couldn't afford. No Internet, computers, modern gaming consoles or personal cellphones. Free TV channels and lots of DVDs were our main source of entertainment and main way no learn outside of school when we were young. Because every movie was filtered when bought and didn't care about what was on TV, I was ignorant to some things. Our house was in ""lock down"" my whole life. Basically we were never allowed to have friends come over nor ask to visit friends. The only time we left our yard was for school, food and bills or holidays. Never had funds for vacations or just ride around town. So I was stuck in a 4 acre yard in the country side of South Louisiana in a small town that had less than ~3,000 people in it my whole life until I enlisted in the Army to escape. 

Also, my mother left when I was 2 years old, and it was just me with my father I'll call ""Frank"", oldest brother I'll call ""Matt"" and the middle older brother I'll call ""Ben"". Matt is 8 years older than me, and Ben is 2 years older.

Side note incase yall are wondering, my mother is not a good person and wouldn't really have changed things. She was into drugs and literally hates us except Ben. We have court notarized statements stating she voluntarily gives up Matt and I's custody just to have occasional supervised visitations for Ben after she got probation for DUI on drugs. She brought the letter for exchange, and volunteerd to provide child support. There was not any black mail or leverage my dad used. She was very vocal on her feelings towards us vs Ben and admitted this to us later in life after we blamed our dad for her distance. 

I remember talking about a topic of one's first and earliest memories when I was in Basic Training. I remember things younger than most than compared to the group of my peers I was talking too. I remember events around 2-3 years of age while they said they remember around 4-6, and none believed me when I said I can remember that far back. Unfortunately of the 10 earliest memories, 8 were me being sexually assaulted, seeing sexual acts, and being molested. When asked to say what my memories were, I'd say only 2 and wouldn't tell them of the others. I'd tell them my first, which was my first dream, and my 4th or so, which was the day my mother left. Because I only talked about those two, I would constantly be told I don't actually remember those. I just think I do because one is a dream, and my mother leaving has probably been told so often to anyone who would listen, so I just remember the stories and think I remember her leaving. But going home and living those experiences for years, I unfortunately know that's not the case, because each day is a reminder of what happened because I lived those events for years. 

One of the earliest things I can remember when it all started was when my dad and oldest brother used to look at porn magazines on the couch. When I ask to look at the pictures they said no. They also talked about whips or paddles. At the time I never realized that was wrong nor able to comprehend. Later in life, I watched Matt sexually touch Ben...then he started touching me. Due to it happening at such a young age, as I started to grow up into such a lifestyle, i thought it was completely normal that Frank and Matt keep touching us, whenever my oldest brother started touching me, Matt would have me touch him, and I would go along with it willingly because I didnt understand what I was really doing. This went on for years. After about a year or two, Ben starting 1st Grade, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to start pre-school, my dad had Matt stop touching us incase we tried to do it to other kids thinking it was normal and get them caught.

Even though it pretty much slowed down with Frank and Matt touching me and Ben, it still happened. At least twice a week at night, Matt would sneak into our room (Ben and I shared a room because we were similar in age) and start touching at least one of us, and while attempting to be suddle and hidden, Frank and Matt would touch each other in my dad's room. They left the door cracked so they can some what keep an eye out for toddlers I suppose. Ben and I would occasionally attempt to spy on them since we weren't allowed in there, but had an opportunity to see whats going on. I also remember a time (I was 4 or 5) walking in on my dad showering with Matt (Matt being 12 or 13 and Frank was about 39 or 40) I don't remember anything sexual happening, but I was to young to understand if anything was happening.

Now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME], I look back at my childhood and see things happened sexually that I never realized until I left home, and looking back were obviously so wrong, and Im so angry with myself for not understanding what was happening. I still should have know it was bad when I was younger. 

We couldn't close doors in our house, that includes bathrooms. So if someone was using the restroom, showering, changing, and even masterbaiting, you could walk by and see it all.

My dad would sometimes go pee right next to us as we were showering, the toilet and shower were next to each other, open the shower curtain as he had his penis out to let us know he's about to flush. One extremely rare occasions, he would walk in as we were pooping, and have us open our legs, and he would attempt to pee between our legs. If he got pee on us, he would either grab toilet paper and wipe it off himself no matter where it was, or have us hop into the shower and he'd get in to scrubb it off. All while us sitting there with it directly in our face, no where to comfortably look. When we would go swimming, we all would strip naked by the door,, then ""to not use so many towels,"" have us walk around naked until clothes were done washing. When ever he would change he would get naked and stay naked for a longer time than needed. And many more things of that nature..... Again, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] angry and hate myself, even though I still know at that time, I grew up like that, and it's not my fault I didn't know better. 

Over the years that continued, so much, that as Ben was going through puberty, he also became more involved in sexual activities. Luckily I being to young, I had no sexual intrests at that time, they would leave me alone for the time being. Now that Ben was more engaging, he would start touching Matt and my dad. He was now included in showering with either one in dad's room, or go to the rooms to ""play."" Eventually Ben got more aggressive, and started to try and do stuff with other kids at school. 

To this day I'm [REDACTED_NAME] CPS never got involved, or no one thought it was that extreme since Ben is minorly mentally challenged. (Not sure if that came off disrespectful, I apologize, but he was pretty much ""normal"" in every way. Very likely you wouldnt know right away, but he couldn't comprehend simple topics or ideas at times, and he had an extremely hard time learning in school/was slower to catch on. I caught up to him in 4th grade and passed him in 6th).

After a close call with several incidents, my dad sat us down and told us that, ""what we do is a family thing"" in so many words, and don't do that with friends, other family that don't live here, or strangers. Only our household family, but also don't talk about it. He described in a way similar to how you don't talk about divorce, money problems, and secrets of people you love. 

Unfortunately Ben became super aggressive and more intense. He definitely didn’t understand, or want to acknowledge consent, bountries, and limits. While anyone was sleeping, he would fondle us, or take our hand and try and get us to fondle him. He would purposely try to catch us in the bathroom, changing, opportunities while asleep and so forth.

After many frequent and aggressive attemps, everyone was getting annoyed at Ben. Eventually Frank started punishments the acts. If we were caught, regardless of who initiated, we were beat. Literally beat. After many, many punishments, Ben stopped all together. Nothing was happening with anyone, or so I think, since I was starting to actively avoid Ben specifically, and Matt because I was tired of being beat and I really wasn't actually sexually active yet. We still couldn't close doors and we got nude if needed for changing or bathroom. Unfortunately as well, Frank would still use the restroom even if we were in there, but hands on just stopped. After enough time past of no incidents, I both thankfully and unfortunately forgot that was even happening. I assume since that life style was my normal and subjected to it at a young age, I was acknowledged it stopped but didn't focusing on it ending, I just moved on. Nothing happened for about ~2.5 years... or so I thought. 

Now time has passed and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] through puberty. I genuinely thought everyone liked both men and women, but because of the religious upbringing in southern Louisiana, I've literally never heard of the term ""Gay,"" in the homosexual context, seen movies or TV with gay people (maybe didn't realize), or met a person who was gay. I somehow never realized that my surroundings were only male and female couples, yet still thought people liked both. 

(A more personal look into my head, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in mental conflict with myself and having self esteem and identity issues. I genuinely don't know if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] gay because of my abuse in addition to no females around, both maternal and in a authority figure way. I don't know how to progress and heal when I have my self reflection moments. I honestly thought liking both male and female was normal. I remember only looking and feeling attracted and aroused to men, and just thinking maybe later I'l feel attracted to women soon.  

Now we go into my first experience learning what gay is while shortly proceeding into the feeling I wasn't ""normal.""

I found out I wasn't ""normal"" when, my friends in 6th grade, were talking about who looked attractive around us. We just got back from summer break was meeting up for the first time before school started. We eventually go into the topic of who we found attractive and everyone was pointing out a few people who ""changed"" during break and what features looked nice. Everyone now points out who they believe is the best looking around us. One by one, the guys start pointing who they like out, my turn was comming up, and I was literally about to point out a guy I thought was attractive. Right as I was going to point to the guy, one the of the kids said to the previous kid while they tease the friend, saying he pointed to the guy next to her, and make jokes and comments, ""You didn't point to her, you want him because your GAY! Hahaha"" and the group laughed and ewwwed. That's when I heard the word gay in a emphasized way. I asked what does that mean since I didn't know the word. After they explained it's a ""disgusting"" act of man with man, I now have the first moments of crisis and confusion of self worth and identity. (My first steps of spiraling into the feeling I wasn't ""normal."")

*Sorry for the tangent and back to the story.

Growing  up in a extremely religious household and small country town. I also grew up poor so there was no Internet for me, computers, gaming consoles or phones anything that would allow me to discover what should have been common knowledge for my age. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] start really hitting puberty, and late compared to my brothers, and my hormones are erratic and self image is shattered. Im having issues navigating my emotions. I kept finding myself thinking about how I wasn't ""normal"" and eventually started saying, then believing, I hated myself. I then started thinking of what happened at home, sadly not the abuse itself, by how it was same sex, and how much I hate myself for doing it. I was trying to force myself into liking women and with each failed attempt, I hated myself more. 

A few months later, I've now been actively trying to masterbate to women, and I either keep going soft, or find myself imagining a random man with a woman, and gradually focus on the man. As I catch myself wondering, I get frustrated and was going to call it quits. Because of the lack of privacy, I've been occasionally masterbaiting in my barn since it was a well secluded space for me. That's when unfortunately Ben caught me, and I didn't notice he was spying on me or for how long. He kept trying to offer to help and contribute. I firmly denied, but he didn't like my answer. I was under weight, about ~90lbs I think, and Ben was about 145lbs. He was almost double my size it felt, and almost a foot taller than me. He ends up pinneding me down and groping me while he's trying to touch himself. He positioned himself in a way, where he was on slightly on his side/back, angled chest up, and his elbow digging into my diaphragm and chest. My breathing was difficult, and with me panicing and exhausting myself out while attempting to get loose, I was basically suffocating. I just stopped moving. I stopped fighting. I let it happened so he can finish and I can just run away. I felt numb and tried so hard to be somewhere else mentally. I was actually still some what fighting to escape, but not to escape. I knew I couldn't, but because I was honestly trying to pass out. It somehow felt like a horrible nightmare. What terrifies me is I have feelings of self doubt that it happened. Even though I know it happened. My brain wants to pretend it's a horrific nightmare and just forget. 

Everything that was happening, what they were doing, and what just happened, I became extremely depressed and self isolated. I didn't know how to process what was going on. I had no one I genuinely trust to confide in. Knowing I had to see him every day, or even being in a space I've seen him in, I felt scared and flashes of that day kept bombarding me. This is the start of when I had my first suicidal thoughts and was doing small self-harm acts such as pinching myself repeatedly in the same area, causing bruises, and scratching myself til I started bleeding

Because I seen him everywhere, I actively looked for secluded spaces in my school to avoid him. At this point I was a grade ahead of him, but small school, we had shared breakfast/lunches, recess, and study hall since we were both in Jr High. I used to hide in my school's back stairwell since it was quite, dim, and a place where I could try to voluntarily go numb and just space out from reality. Eventually I just had a really bad day. I didn't hear a teacher walk in, or he was up in the top of the stairs before I came in not making a sound right away. As soon as I sat down at the bottom steps, I bawled and said out loud, ""I just want to die."" He obviously came up to me to comfort and see what's going on. He asked why I said that and I panicked now knowing he heard that. I didn't want anyone knowing. I pleaded with him, trying to convince him that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] OK, and begged not to tell anyone. Thankfully he didn't listen and went and attempted to help. I was escorted to the front office to speak with the school counselor. 

While it was great he did what he needed and attempted his best to get me help, unfortunately that's not what happened. I never talked specifically of what was happening to due to shame, anger, embarrassment, and being scared. I knew they were going to call my dad and I was terrified. I was just being very vague in my situation, but some what honest in my emotions. What doesn't help, is that I have a slightly higher, above average voice, but not the cliche flamboyant/feminine speech pattern or body language. Just puberty never really deepend my voice. Granted while I never came out or told anyone at this point I was into men, maybe it was more obvious than I believed. She asked if I was sad because I was gay. I was petrified for a moment and was having a debate of being honest or should I lie. Both her having a genuine, soothing, and comfortable voice and tone, and me being silent for a long moment gave her the answer to that question. So she started talking about me being gay. This was the first time I have ever talked to someone about thinking I was gay, or at least the idea that I thought some men were attractive. Again she just had a soothing voice almost as everything is going to be OK.  So I started opening up about my thoughts on liking men. After maybe 15-30 minutes, literally felt like an eternity, simultaneously being terrified and slightly being relieved in expressing my thoughts, she instantly started saying how its normal to think you like men, but as a boy, I shouldn't. How god created women for men and etc... Then she had me talk about what makes me think I like men. At this point I freeze up and feel light headed. I feel so much shame and embarrassment, as if I just admitted to enjoying kicking puppies and she was gently scolding me and was disappointed.

She then starts changing topics, asking about home since I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and less responsive. I let her know I have no mom, only a father and two brothers, then she cuts me off. Asking about any women in my life such as aunts, grandma or cousins. I tell her I have some, but I don't really visit them often. Mainly on holidays and rare occasions and that's it. Again she asks, but now close friends, and leads to more specific in female friends. I tell her I don't have friends. Not as in, ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and no one likes me."" As in other than class, I dont seek out and maintain platonic relationships, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] by myself. Eventually she boils it down to I'm [REDACTED_NAME] myself, because she thinks I'm ""turning gay,"" due to not having women around to ""develop appropriate thoughts and relationships."" 

Because I said I wanted to die, she has to call my dad and have him come pick me up. When she asks me for his number, I lie and say I don't know his number. She then says pull up his contact in my phone, and show her. I tell her I don't have a phone, which is true, but she gets irritated thinking I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about that. She has to contact the front office for my records and asks for his number. At this point I was in a real panic and literally on my knees begging her don't call. She has me step out of the office to be able to call him. 
When my dad arrived he was escorted to her office and had a private meeting who knows how long. After a while, and thousands of thoughts racing in my head, they step out. She stands with him and says to me and him, she highly encourages him to have me go to church more often, that includes our towns ""bonus"" day, (If you can't make the normal Wednesday or Sunday, we have a Saturday you can attend. Also Sunday school, then before and after school bible study on Wednesdays.) We are NOT a religious private school, just a public school. But due to high amount of everyone being extremely religious, and bible belt southern Louisiana, the last few school board members and superintendent have been trying to turn the school into a religious school for years. (We even had to wear school uniforms and follow almost all the things a normal religious private schools do. While I'm [REDACTED_NAME] entirely sure since I don't understand how it fully works, to my understanding, most parents voted no every time they wanted to make the school have something religious, but they had meetings every year to vote and make it a religious school. Without giving to much away, when the religious crew on board first started, they changed our school mascot because our old one was The Purple Demon. Literally the reason they changed it was because they argued having ""demon spirit"" (What they had students cheer during pep-rallies to motivate and excite them) was causing students to be more willing to do crimes and drugs...etc because we are teaching them it's OK to give into the demon/devil persuasions. And yes they literally told us that when announcing the new mascot.)

As my dad is picking me up, he's yelling and screaming about how he left work for me and how I wasting his day and etc. Going on about how we might not eat because it's my fault he won't make enough money since he had to temporarily clock out to pick me up. Then started slapping me and slowing worked to punching/pounding at me, all the way to his work as he's yelling. The more he talked, the angrier he got, and the harder the hits became.

I don't know if she said anything about me being gay, or just told him that I need some ""Help from the Lord,"" somehow he did not bring up the topic of the meeting at all or anything which may have been discussed. We arrive at his work, a local gas station, and l'm trying so hard not to cry in public, I literally felt it was physically hurting me from what was going on mentality. It was hurting worse than all the hits i received on the ride over. I sit at a booth in the far back of the store, hiding my face begging to crawl in a hole and die at this point. For a while, this became the worst day ever, and I felt more and more suicidal. 

Back at home later, about a year or so, when I thought it had all stopped, all these years, apparently my other brothers haven't stopped touching each other. They either hid it so well or never tried with me around. One day I woke up feeling super nauseated. My dad keeps peptobismol tablets in his medicine cabinet in his room. We live in a trailer and you have to cross the living room to the other side of the house where the primary bedroom is. We have to ask permission to go into his room. Also he sleeps on the couch even though he has a bed. I dont know why but thats what he always did. So I found it strange he wasnt there. As I get close to the door, I hear talking and random noises with colorful lights from the TV under the door. At first I slowly twist the door knob, making sure not to make a sound, so I can sneak in if he's sleeping, but the doors locked. Coincidentally, a week prior, i learned about make shift para-scopes from a cartoon. So I looked from something to act as a mirror. As l'm looking, I find a old DVD upside down, that was super reflective like a mirror. I go to the slit under the door, and use the reflection to see what's going on. That's when I noticed... My father and Matt are naked...doing sexual acts while porn is playing on the TV. At that moment my heart started to race so hard and fast, I felt it come out of my chest, but it also felt like the world has stopped for some reason. I instantly remembered everything that happened, and I was confused on why I forgot. Because everything I was going through, and now witnessing it happened, I literally somehow forgot what was happening. I was angry, confused, discussed, and so many emotions I didn't know what to feel. By this time, I grew up enough to know what sex is. I wasn't innocent as much anymore. After that I walked back to my bed and just layed there silently. Both angry at them, thinking its their fault for me being gay, and angry at myself. I was angry with myself because I let myself forget the actions that caused me to be gay. 

I didn't know exactly what incest was at the time. No one really talks about it, especially when your a kid. But I now knew it wasn't a good thing, mainly because in school, our science and history teacher had lessons earlier that involved moments of the topic of incest on how bad it is for genetics when related. Like how Egyptian royals used to have kids with each other to ""keep bloodline pure"" When looking through hindsight, I never really understood how bad things were at home. I grew up to this. To me, this was ""normal."" But to everyone else, it was a horrible thing. I was terrified it would come out some how. I didn't want to ask for help because I would both have to acknowledge it happened and I participated in it too. 

Sadly, this also really hurt being Gay, because all the religious people/students talked down about being gay (Equal Marriage just became legal) I was taught that being gay is wrong from church. So my life felt wrong. My feelings felt wrong. I felt like my life was wrong. Even after all these years, I honestly feel l'm just this disgusting thing. It has really destroyed me. Now I know gay itself is not a bad thing, or to be shamed of, it's been hard to completely break that mentality of questioning was a born this way, or taught this. 

This continued for years, but because I realized how bad things I tried to keep away and it pretty much died down in my side. Do to hating being gay, I had no sex drive or intentions. Whenever they went to touch me or have me touch them, I'd make an excuse not to and leave, or got into actual physical fights to deture their actions. Then they pretty much excluded me. Which was good in one way, but they got more physically abusive because of it.

After a few more years, my brother Matt turned 22 I believe, and apparently he told the girl he's was dating about the household ""family activities."" She was so disgusted, she broke up with him. She also went around town telling everyone, and in a small town, words get around quick. With that, in a good and bad way, she was also known for lying and taking drugs, and again, my dad and church/religious town closely connected. So while many people couldn't believe a town liar, that had ""such a absurd lie on a single father who was a family man of God."" Not to many believe her, but they acknowledge how bad that would be if true. That just fueled the flame of me realizing how bad things were, but also seemed to REALLY open Matt's eyes too.

Eventually Matt didn't want to do anything sexual anymore. He would make excuses or something to prevent my father from trying. But that still didn't stop them, because my father would hang it over his head by either saying if he didn't put out, he wouldn't help pay his car note, or insurance for his motorcycle. Which he loved his motorcycle. Matt started worked extra hours to both get out of the house, and to make more money so my father wouldn't have anymore leverage over him. He also had to deal with Ben now becoming extremely aggressive with him sleep fondling him more, because he was a heavy sleeper from being exhausted. Now he worked longer, harder, and was getting little sleep because of Ben, which made the whole house hold raise in tension and anger over time since everyone was fighting.

Because Matt worked long hours and wasn't putting out anymore, eyes started shifting toward me and Ben. Ben was up for it most of the time, but I would assume because I was the harder one to get who wasn't involved anymore, it was like my dad wanted it even more from me. At first it was little things, like when were outside, he would randomly pee next to me and make sure he was facing me. He would start walking around naked and make way to far sexual jokes that involved me and him. Then it got to the point where he'd get in the shower with me on several occasions. Sometimes I was quick thinking about preventing it from happening, others I was not.

When he was there, he would get erect, but never really tried touching me. I didn't know what to do or where to look. I didn't want to look at him, especially in the eyes because of embarrassment, anger, and shame, but I didn't want to look down and give him what he wants. I basically started to look at the wall and tried my absolute best to hold all my emotions in and stonewall. No words or looks of expression. Eventually the best defense I had was turning on the water as hot as possible, and getting used to the pain, enough to where he didn't want to join anymore. He never really tried to join afterwards but he would be in there ""brushing his teeth"" or using the restroom right before I got out and was just staring at me the whole time while I dried off and got changed

Fast forward once again, Mat is 23/24. He's with a new girlfriend now, and is really trying to escape at this point. Tensions are really high, because Matt is my dad's favorite son. Matt finally has enough and tried to sneak out one night a move everything he has to his girlfriends. He gets one or two tubs of stuff out before my dad catches them. As a last ditch effort, my dad tries to hold everything above his head. lf he leaves now, since the car and motorcycle are in Franks name, he won't get them. Also everything he owns still in the house won't go with him. He'll just leave with the clothes on his back and what he currently got. We'll Matt got to escape with nothing but the clothes on his back and a few items. I do want to say, Matt has changed in a good way. He's opened his eyes and doesn't want to be apart of this no more. He's saved me from Ben when Ben pinned me down again and was probably going to fully rape me that night. Even though I've been open and vulnerable, I do not want to talk about that night.

Since his ""escape"" life started getting really bad for me now. Me and Matt look so much alike. So not only do I look like his favorite son that left and he hates now, I won't provide and he has nothing materialistic to hang over my head because I have little intrests in things currently. So now almost everyday I'm [REDACTED_NAME] slapped, punched, or something abusive. This will continue through highschool.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] lucky I went through JROTC in highschool. It showed me that I wouldn't be stuck in a small town with $7.25hr job at part time. So I talk to a recruiter that had a guest visit and talked about enlisting. I have to wait a few months after I graduate to enlist when l'm 18. Unless my dad will sign a sheet for me to enlist early at 17 and soon join after I graduate. So I wait for the perfect opportunity. At the end of school senior year, I wait until you have to sign all the teachers paperwork for the class. I ask the recruiter for a copy of the paper that requires his signature. I throw the enlistment sheet in there that has a signature block. He never caught it and just signs everything to get it done and over with. I deal with everything daily, taking all the abuse, and just skating by at this point. When ever I had a bad day, I picture the day I get onto a bus and leave. Finally graduate and exactly 28 days after graduation, l'll will be sent to Basic Training

Since l've graduated, the days have been feeling much, much worse. Mainly because l'm at home more because no more school. I start trying to stay in my work's break room when shift is over for as long as I can. Home life is horrible. Still all the abuse is there. A accidental moment where my coworker slips up, he finds out l've been lying about my hours and hates I'm [REDACTED_NAME] at home. Literally the worst thing happens, he applies for a management position at my work, and gets it. Now l'm in his sights at all times. Both at home and work. He's even hit me in front of customers. Finally after waiting those 28 days, feeling like a literal eternity, I pay a friend to drive me to the town that my recruiters office is so l'Il be shipped of to basic. 

l've cut all contact with him and my brothers. I've been gone for almost 8 years and spoken to him a few days because my Grandma passed away. She was my mother to me because she actually cared about me. After that, I currently havent spoken to him in, 5 years. He's pretty my turned my whole family against me at this point. He found out I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the army but has no idea where. I had to leave all my friends and family to escape him. I don't post on social media or anything where I can be identified. My life is much better considering. I acknowledge I need help but struggle knowing i have to look at someone as I tell them my story. He's some what gotten close to finding me. He some how got connections that got him in contact with my Platoon Sergeant. I just tell my sergeant I cannot and will not speak to him, will he please not talk to him and don't tell him our location or any information about me. He had to block him the next day because he called almost 100 times. There were more close calls but that was the most surprising.

A good thing about me from all the pain, I have a amazing husband, a house, and new car. I have never told anyone about any of this except the one previous time i posted this. This is my secret I want to take to the grave. I want to tell someone, have him lock away forever. But thats a cost. A cost of my shame knowing it happened. Going to court to testify looking him in the eyes. Have all that anger, hate, shame, and everything that took literal years to comes to terms with enough to move on. My husband doesn't know, and I never want him to know, but I want to tell him because Im going through so much and I need his support that hes always given me. The last few months have been extremely bad and he wants to help, but I can't let him. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if he finds out. If he does, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] he'll change his veiw of me which will be expected, but i feel like theres a chance he'll leave me too because he's disgusted

And that's not even the saddest part...

I don't know if I still love my father... he's getting old and really sick the past few years... and after everything he's done... I don't know if I still love him... It's been 5 years, no contact what so ever. l've heard from around town his been miserable and really sick. Even though the sympathy isn't there, I feel like I don't want him do die alone. l've had dreams where he died, and I woke up with regret, enough to where I started several messages wanting to send it to him, but calming down and never sending it. I know he'll die soon. He's in bad health, always had bad health, and smokes a lot. So part of me wants to reach out. Not to forgive him. I honestly don't know what for. For it to be easier on me? lf he does pass away I can say I tried? I just don't know what for. I hate him so much, but sadly and shamefully love him. I don't want him in my life, but I don't want him to die alone... I just don't know anymore..

Thank you for reading, just typing this brought up a lot of emotions that needed to come out. I just needed this off my chest..",1
9lojvq,1538761851.0,2018-10-05 17:50:51,offmychest,"I want to tell my story, but there is no one I can tell it to.","When I was 7 years old, my father raped me for the first time.  It continued until I was 14, when I told the first person I ever told: my therapist.  I told her because I incorrectly thought she would be sworn to secrecy.  

My father vehemently denied the allegations, and I was put in foster care.  A long court battle ensued, and I handed over evidence but I refused to testify.  I was afraid of him, I hated being in the spotlight, and I could just generally think of nothing more terrifying.  I didn’t want revenge, or even “justice,” I just wanted it to all go away and I could go back to my normal quiet life. When I turned 18, the state gave me a box of letters that they had intercepted from family members who had tried to write to me during my time in foster care. It was very emotional because I had no contact with family during that time and thought they all hated me or abandoned me. I had no idea they had been trying to reach out to me, and I sat down to read them all.

100% of the letters accused me of lying.  Some were scathing, some were nicer, but they all came from people who believed my father.  “How could you do this to him? Why would you ruin his life?” I honestly don’t know of a word that can describe how I felt. Heartbroken comes close, but still doesn’t seem quite right.

On my 21st birthday, my father called me: the restraining order from the court had run out.  It was tearful and I want to explain to anyone reading that I never wanted to ruin his life. That might be hard to understand, but despite the abuse I loved my dad and I missed him in a way. I never wished for him to suffer, although I was grateful the abuse had stopped.  We never spoke about any of it.

I’m 30 years old now, and my father died two years ago.  I never saw him in person again, not since that day at the therapist when I was 14, and we never had a conversation about the abuse, or the court proceedings, or anything.  Our few phone conversations just consisted of updates on our respective lives. 

When he died, I was contacted by his friends.  I was his only child and inherited everything because he had no will. I flew back to my home state to take care of his things, and stepped into the childhood home I hadn’t been to in 15 years. I met people from my childhood, some who I remembered, others who I didn’t, and no one mentioned anything. Some of the same family members who had written me letters (I remember all of them) over a decade before, reached out. Still, no one brought up the elephant in the room, and I was warned by lawyers not to trust the motives of people who come out of the woodwork after an inheritance. I know they all think I’m a liar, it did not need to be declared again.

As I was going through his things, I found child porn.  A lot of it.  He ran an orphanage in southeast asia with his friends (the same ones who were being so nice to me), and I questioned the legitimacy of that organization.  His friends tried to convince me not to report, and I listened until common sense kicked in. I reported it to the FBI, two years ago, and have never heard back. It’s stupid to say now, but it never occurred to me that he was a pedophile.  He was just my dad: an upstanding member of his community, a charitable, charming and funny man who everyone—including me—loved endlessly.  I always believed I was the only one he did this to. That’s not even entirely accurate: it just never even occurred to me that there may be other victims. That same feeling, the one almost like heartbreak, flooded over me for the second time in my life.

As an adult, I can look back and see the chain of events differently. I know I was a victim, though I didn’t feel like one at the time. Not only was I a victim of abuse, but I was a victim of ostracizing afterward. I never got to hear my father apologize, even privately, or acknowledge at all that I was not lying. I accept that now I never will, and while I have regrets I am [REDACTED_NAME] on. There’s still the possibility that the surviving family members who wrote me those letters can come forward and validate my experience by saying they believe me—but my life doesn’t depend on it and I won’t hold my breath. That said, it does still hurt.

I have dealt with the abuse, and the relationship with my father through years of therapy. I realized this last month that what I never quite coped with was our community’s invalidation of my experience. I couldn’t even begin to imagine how that would feel on a national level. Seeing the comments from angry Kavanaugh supporters, and the #himtoo movement, has brought up a lot of hidden emotions.  My boyfriend is the only person (other than old friends from high school) in my life who knows about any of this.  Many of our friends are conservatives, and I wish I could tell them how much it hurts me personally to hear them hurl nasty insults at Ford, and curl safe defenses and praises around Kavanaugh. They say she has no evidence, but neither do I see evidence to support that she is lying.

I know that false accusations happen, and they sicken me.  I absolutely agree that it’s a horrible thing for someone to go through: to be falsely accused.  What I think some people may forget in this impassioned political climate, is how equally painful it is for a survivor to be accused of lying.

I want to remind my friends to be compassionate, and to hold their convictions in the absence of evidence.  But I won’t say anything, because that’s who I am. I am [REDACTED_NAME] silent one, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] alone. I have given society permission to dismiss me by being the silent one, but other women have not. I see them as my heroes, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] grateful to every person that chooses to listen to them.  That is my justice. ",149
rkjqav,1639993803.0,2021-12-20 09:50:03,offmychest,My dad molested me when I was 11,"I (22 F) honestly don't remember how I got into the situation I was in, but for some reason one evening I decided to nap in my parents bed instead of my own while my dad was drinking. Since I could remember I've used sleeping kinda like the meditation mechanic in the Witcher lol. Just to skip time or when i was upset and i didnt feel like dealing with it. I usually cover myself fully and pull the blanket over my head. My mom does this too, so I guess I got it from her.

I was like. Half asleep. And I remember feeling the bed dip and I knew it was my dad since my mom was gone? I don't really remember where she was. I thought he was just going to nap with me. But I was terribly wrong. I just remember my blood going cold, and my body going numb while he started to touch me. Between my thighs, my butt, everything. I felt like my skin was melting off. I remember snapping to and clenching my butt thinking he would stop and he didn't, so I rolled away and got off the bed. He was trying to reach for my arm and saying something to me. I would assume he was saying sorry and ""I thought you were your mom!"" but I couldn't hear anything, my blood was pounding in my ears. I ran to the door of the bedroom and my mom was standing there, looking at me asking what was wrong. She kept asking me what was wrong, I kept saying nothing but then she asked me if he touched me. I lied. I said no, he was just being annoying. Went to my room and went to sleep. No one ever brought it up again. 

For a long time I just wrote this off as an accident. Telling myself it wasn't supposed to happen, and ignored it. I've never acknowledged it, hoping it would be less real. About a month ago, I was thinking about it. I was 11. 5'2. My mom? Late 30's. 5'8. Much bigger than me. At this moment I realized that he lied. He knew it was me. He had to. Theres no way. What's more is my whole teen/young adult life he's made passing remarks when I wear make up, or dress nice and he will call me pretty or gorgeous. Normal dad doting on their only child/daughter thing right?? But sometimes he calls me sexy. And it makes my skin crawl. He's a bit weird and I just. Kinda figure oh that's my dad, he says weird shit, whatever. Dont wanna be even weirder and make a big deal out of it so I'll ignore it. But I've come to realize i was just lying to myself this whole time. I know it's creepy. He HAS to know its creepy...And I know if someone was in my shoes I would tell them its wrong and not okay, so why is it okay when it happens to me???

Something else I feel like saying that may or may not be related is my early childhood is really really blurry. I dont remember any of it. Maybe little scenes, but nothing detailed. But something I can remember pretty well is being..sexually inclined to put it lightly..since I was 3 or 4. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] making accusations or anything, but I can't help but wonder if my inner child is protecting me from something even more terrifying than the story I shared. Its a really scary thought. And I really wanted to believe that everything truly was an accident, and that my dad just loves me a lot. I really really wanted to believe that. I just don't think it's in line with reality. 

If you read all this, thank you so much for listening to me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if this is appropriate for this sub, but a friend recommended it to me and I took her word for it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not really an avid reddior, i just wanted a place to share my story. So..here I am. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] hoping that this being out there will make it feel more real and less like it's just in my head.",6
izgtkd,1601028188.0,2020-09-25 10:03:08,offmychest,Reporting sexual assault through Title IX was the most degrading and misogynistic experience of my life and I will probably never tell anyone my story ever again.,"A couple of years ago I had a disturbing sexual encounter with a new friend as I started to be ok again after a devastating life event. It just didn’t feel right and I tried to talk to him about it and he just kept gaslighting me, talking about how it was a night of passionate lovemaking that I was really into. I don’t remember much after he took my shirt off and carried me into his room. No drugs or alcohol were involved. I just remember saying this shouldn’t be happening and I don’t think we should be doing this, I don’t think we should be having sex right now. He remembered me saying those things too.  It just didn’t seem right and I was scared and confused and I stupidly went to friends to try and crowdsource how I should feel. Then his secret girlfriend contacted me begging me to tell her the truth because he wasn’t being honest with her. I’d been trying to cut contact but after she and I talked (big mistake; she has major Stockholm syndrome), when I became aware of the full extent of his deception, I dropped off the face of the Earth. Then there were these weird coincidences, people at my school I didn’t really know inviting me to stuff that he would be at. After almost running into him a couple of times, I cut everything off with everyone. It was months before I was able to fully process all of it. Looking back, he was grooming me. He befriended me after finding out I had just gone through a personal tragedy when I was at my most vulnerable, was super nice, did me a bunch of favors, introduced me to his circle of friends, but at the same time, got progressively touchier, pushier, pressured me for a physical relationship I made clear I wasn’t ready for. Even though I said I didn’t want a relationship, the access to social interaction was a breath of fresh air after basically living in a closet alone for months, so I tried to negotiate, maintaining boundaries as best I could without losing these new friends and being included in life. But one night he managed to push past my boundaries and things just got completely out of hand. So many intimacy milestones that for me would usually span weeks and months all in one night. It all happened so fast. I was disoriented for days after. He told me it probably felt weird because he wasn’t my ex, the only man I’d been with the 5 years prior to us calling off our wedding. I agonized over why I didn’t say no, or say anything more than “I don’t think” or “this shouldn’t be”, about why I put myself in that situation, why I agreed to hold hands and kiss knowing how incredibly aggressive he’d proven to be. I was so ashamed of myself. I felt filthy and foolish and less than a human, like dirt. But it wasn’t over. When I cut him off for good, by then he’d already befriended my former friends, tried to start a collaboration with my boss, like he was encircling me. The only way to get away was to withdraw from life completely again. And any school event that I would resurface for, he would find a way to get close to me, happened to need to talk to someone standing near me, sat in an empty seat behind me in a room full of empty seats. When I started showing signs of PTSD, my professor encouraged me to go to our Title IX, when she thought it was just sexual harassment. When the lady read me the school’s definition of consent, I broke down completely. She said, just because your experience doesn’t look like someone else’s, doesn’t mean it was ok. It was the first time I’d heard the expression “affirmative consent”. I thought this lady was my savior. I decided to report. Eight agonizing months later, them all pretending to care and understand and respect my dignity as a person but also not really investigating any of the stalking and harassment evidence I gave them and not doing anything when he violated no-contact orders, I got the report. And my God. It was every sexist stereotype you can think of. They made me out to be a tease that got what she deserved, that let things go too far and was now regretful and wanted to protect her golden girl image. It was honestly sickening. They said it was unfortunate the respondent didn’t stop to clarify consent before his tongue touched my vulva but that it was reasonable for him to think I was consenting despite all the verbal things I was saying to the contrary, even though he admitted to seeing I was uncomfortable. He said I wasn’t giving myself permission to enjoy it. They said that just because I didn’t want to do it, doesn’t mean I didn’t consent; a person can not want to do something but still consent. It still blows my mind in the case file how many times and different ways he confessed to taking sex when he could see I did not want to have sex. Two appeals denied, now my last option is an Office of Civil Rights complaint. When I first reported, he got into an accident and was off campus for a few weeks and those few weeks were the freest I’d felt in over a year. I didn’t have to look over my shoulder. I didn’t have to reconsider walking into a restaurant I know he’d been to years before. During that time I got involved in women’s rights groups on campus and really thrived on the positive female camaraderie, at least until I got my report and realized they had all been humoring me this whole time, smiling and pretending to care while secretly looking at me like a liar abusing a good system that was for real victims, for revenge. Before I file this complaint, I’ve been trying to reform the system from the inside, but it’s impossible. Everywhere I look, they are saying all the right things and seemingly doing all the right things, acting like they care about students’ safety and well-being, except you [throwaway], you go to hell. But the rest of you, please just reach out if you’re struggling. I can’t reconcile what I’m hearing and what I personally experienced. What is it about me that convinced them I was being dishonest? I was at my most vulnerable and authentic version of myself in those interviews and they were just laughing at me the whole time. I’m making some small inroads to help do my part to make sure people are safe and treated like human beings, and I’m worried about what my new colleagues will think when they find out I’ve reported the very school they think is perfect at this to the federal government. I have to make this decision soon. If I do it, that will be the last time I will ever tell my story to anyone for as long as I live. I still don’t even know how to act around people anymore. It feels like everything I do must make me seem dishonest or deceitful, otherwise why did they talk about me that way in the report? I found a way to get through it, grow from it, and even use what I know to be for others the safe person I needed, but I’ll never fully recover from reliving the worst thing that’s ever happened to me to strangers who were scoffing at me the whole time. Thanks for listening.",6
2guqoq,1411127852.0,2014-09-19 11:57:32,offmychest,I was in an abusive relationship- hope my story will help someone.,"Several months after the end of my abusive relationship, I find myself craving to let it off my chest. Few people know about this, as I am [REDACTED_NAME] to sound as an ""attention whore"" to them. I finally decided that I should share my story without being ashamed about it. My main goal is not to find some pity. By sharing my story, I simply hope that someone who is in this same situation can finally find the strength to put an end to their nightmare. I know that my ex might happen to read this, but I don't really care, as I will not refer to any place or date, and I will not reveal any name. 

It all started about a year ago, when I met who I thought was a wonderful guy. We would just talk for hours, getting to know each other better, and I slowly realized at a certain point that I was in love with him. He would understand and support me, and being in a very difficult period of my life, I really appreciated that.
We got together pretty quickly, and I must admit that things started to be weird since the very beginning. I thought that maybe it was me, that I had to give him time, that maybe I just had to get to know him better. After all, he had problems as well, and I was totally willing to help him through that.

I don't really know how things started. I just know that, slowly, he started giving me some ""rules"". We would never go out, and those few times we did, he would just make me feel guilty about it afterwards. He would say that I was never happy about him, that he did anything for me (doing ""anything"" was going out once in a month for a couple of hours, just to make me happy) while I did nothing for him (while, actually, I seriously became his “slave”, and I had to do everything he asked me to). At first, I thought, well maybe he is right. At the start of our relationship, we would go out sometimes. After a month or so, I found myself feeling happy even when we simply walked to the supermarket, because that would be the only thing we did together outside of his bedroom walls. At a certain point, we even stopped doing that. He would always be mad at me, so he treated me like his slave. He would just force me to go to the supermarket every time he wanted something. Once, he let me go there three times in a day just because I did not get what he wanted.

Slowly, he also started isolating me from my friends. I must admit that it is partially my fault. I allowed him to do so. I was so in love with him at that point that I would have done anything to keep him into my life. During the first period, he made it sound as if I was the one who wanted to be there with him all the time. This happened before I realized that he was actually manipulating me, and convincing me that I was the one who was isolating herself. In reality, he just slowly convinced me that this one friend of mine wasn't good for me, and neither was this other one. I did not believe him at first, so I would keep seeing them, until he just did not allow me to see certain friends of mine anymore, ""because they have a bad influence on you, and I know what a whore you are"". At this point, I must say that I have never, ever cheated in my whole life, I never thought of cheating on him, and I would still never cheat on anyone. Yet he was so convinced that I was a whore.
He also forced me to quit smoking. And I did, because it was the only way to keep him by my side. At first I really thought that if I did not obey, he would dump me. With time I realized that he would have never broken up with me. He would simply become violent, but he would never leave me.

The first slap came this one day when I dared to say that I really felt like smoking. Bam, right on my face. I thought it was a kind of joke, or at least I convinced myself that it was. Since that slap, for about a month, he would just softly slap my face sometimes when I did something ""wrong"". 
As the time passed by, apparently I got worse and worse at being what he wanted me to be. He thought I did not put enough effort in our relationship, he thought I did it on purpose. He never realized that I was just drained. I was never enough for him. Being a good girlfriend for him meant to simply do what he asked me to do, and always say he was right. At first I could manage to do that, but at a certain point I just couldn’t find the strength anymore. 

Above all, he thought I was stupid. He really convinced me that I was not smart at all. He said that he had never met anyone smarter than himself in his own life, and I was definitely among the most stupid people he knew. He would say that my English was awful (one thing I can reveal, I am [REDACTED_NAME] a native English speaker), that my university was for dumb people like me (people, I study medicine AND psychology, and have a very good GPA by the way), and that if I had to study so hard for my final exam it must have meant that I was dumb! He never realized that I was just way too insecure, and suffering from ADHD makes me have to spend hours and hours on the books..  

Among the awful things he did to me, yesterday I was thinking about this one particular episode, which I think was one of the “nicest” things he did to me among the worst. Just to get you a feeling of how badly he treated me: My university has this kind of prom during spring. In my country we don’t have such a thing, so I was super excited to go to my first prom. I bought tickets for both me and him, and for once he accepted to go out of his bedroom walls and actually do something with me. On one condition: we had to come back at midnight, cause he had to go to school early the day afterwards. Okay, fair enough. For once, he came picking me up at my place. I was so incredibly happy, because this was such an exception. I was wearing this amazing dress, which has a big value for me (my mom wore it on a very special occasion when she was pregnant of me, and then I received it as a present from her). I tied my hair up, wore nice make-up, earrings and all. I must say, I think I am [REDACTED_NAME] a pretty girl, and that night I really looked amazing. I felt as if lately things were going worse than ever, so in a stupid attempt to make him like me I bought him 80 bucks worth of tickets to go to a festival together in May in our town. So, as soon as he showed up, with a big smile on my face, I gave him the envelop and asked him to open it. As soon as he saw the tickets, he smiled, but then he said: “haha, so you’re buying these so that you think I’m gonna stick with you until may?!”. I found it painful, but okay, whatever. I said he could go with a friend, if he didn’t want to go with me. Next thing he said was: “oh my God, look at you, you’re so ugly, with your stupid dress and your hair up!”. I just bursted into tears at that point. Damn it, I imagined my first prom to be magical, with a romantic guy who would just stare at me and be proud of showing me off, but no, he had to be rude once again. He then kind of apologized, and at the party he was super bored and annoying to me, so that night I got my consolation just by talking to a couple of guys who complimented me for looking that beautiful. They cheered me up.

At a certain point in our relationship, he started insulting my parents. He manipulated me, convinced me that without him I would be alone. No one would love me. All of my friends hated me, and my family would not be there for me. I believed him. At a certain point, I started hating him, yet I would still be together with him because I WAS SCARED. And this is why:
After the period in which he would just slap me, things started going worse and worse. Every time I contradicted him, or went on and on supporting one idea of mine, he would just hit me. He said, how can I not hit you if this is the only way I've got to let you stop?! Well, if he ever tried to listen to me, maybe he would have found a way.
The more violent he was, the more scared I got, but also the more I fought. The more he tried to convince me that he was, once again, the one who was right, ""because after all, you are stupid and you're never right"", I would just go on trying to explain to him why I might be right this time. And trust me people, I did not just merely want to win an argument. I don't care, I may be wrong sometimes, we all are. But sometimes, he would not admit the most stupid things to be right. He always had to contradict me- and convince me that I was the one contradicting him.

Anyway, I don't remember how things escalated. I just know that every time he would hit me, it was a surprise, new things were added to the horrible list of things he did to me. Spitting on me, twisting my wrists until it hurt, pulling my hair, smashing my head on the walls, smashing my entire body repeatedly against the walls, pushing me off the bed, punching my boobs, my arms, my knees (he actually ruined one of my knee tendons, and he does not even know about this.. now sometimes I can barely walk), my legs.. the list might go on. The moment I started getting really scared though was when he had these crazy moments. I mean, of course hitting me like that was already crazy, but in some moments I could see the desire to kill me in his eyes. In those moments, he would grab my neck tight in his hands, squeezing it until I could not breathe anymore.. I swear I thought I would die, many times. I am [REDACTED_NAME] very religious at all, but in those moments, desperate, I would just start praying, because I thought that my life was seriously coming to an end. Then, right before I could not breathe anymore, he would release the grip for a few seconds, let me breathe a bit and then start again.. He would do this about three times, until his raptus finished.
I have been threatened to be killed by him. He would call me horrible names, convincing me that I was a whore for real. I would not repeat the names because I think it is not appropriate, but thinking of them still hurts me deep inside. One of the last times I have been hit, it was because I could not attend his mother's birthday party because my parents were visiting me. That day was one of those in which I thought I would die. I ran away to my home country for about a month, and that has been the best period among the worst. I felt finally safe, but I was scared of coming back. In fact, for the whole month, I kept trying to break up with him, then he would call me, cry on the phone, and convince/force me to get back together. For two days or so he would be the best boyfriend ever, and I thought “well, maybe he finally changed, we can be happy again”, but then he would get mad because I did not answer for an hour, or because I went to the gym although I knew he wanted to talk to me on that specific moment of the day, so he started getting verbally violent again. Many times, he threatened me that if he would see me again when I was back, he would kill me. Sometimes, he would simply say that he would come to my place and kill me. Brace yourself.

But one day, finally, after having been hit for the first time in the street, I realized that I really had to stop this nightmare. It was not fair anymore. I had been suffering too much, some days I would just not have the courage to look at myself in the mirror, because I was ashamed of what I was doing to myself. And for what? Simply because I thought he was the best I could get. I thought ""better being hit than having no one, no one who loves me"". Then finally, I realized that he did not love me at all, and that I was better off without him.
The day I reported him, he threatened me to share my naked pictures to my family and his friends. He threatened to kill me again. At that point, I found in myself the strength to go to the police.
After that day, I have had very tough moments. I am [REDACTED_NAME] struggling with my health, both physical and psychological. But in that exact moment that I walked out of the police station doors, I felt like the most free girl in the world. That day, I realized how many people loved me. All of my friends, who I had abandoned, rushed to my place to check out on me, my parents took their first flight to take care of me (they had never known anything before my report). And then I felt so stupid, thinking for all that time that he was the only one who would be there for me, as he had tried to convince me.. 

So, whoever is reading this and can relate to my situation somehow, please know that you are strong. Do not believe one word your violent partner is telling you. Run away, before it’s too late. I know that if I did not, I might have ended up dead or seriously damaged one day. So please, just find the strength that is inside of you and break up with them. If I did it, you can do it as well. I am [REDACTED_NAME] any stronger than you, you are not any weaker than me. I believe that you can all find the strength to go all the way with it, and stop your nightmare. Because no matter how many flaws we have and how many mistakes we might have made, we do not deserve one single moment of this shit. So please, love yourself. ",48
k2yvt9,1606608585.0,2020-11-29 00:09:45,offmychest,"I was ""groomed"" in my tween years and didn't realize it until recently.","I was 12 years old when we met. We were on the same social media. I don't remember how it started (due to surpressing alot of the things that happened), but we did alot of roleplay related to our common fandom. So much of it wasn't appropriate. I lied about my age, said I was 14. They were 18 at the time and even if I did say I was 2 years older, they knew I was underage.

Couple of months pass, they tell me how special I am [REDACTED_NAME] all that cliché stuff you'd hear from a person like this. It keeps getting worse. They tell me they like me outside of the roleplay stuff, and would go on and off about our relationship. Told me they loved me. I also came forward about my real age. That did not stop them.

Time went on. We kept up the roleplay I think they had a partner irl that broke up with them, but I don't remember clearly.
I feel so disgusted with myself for initiating alot of it, thinking that's what I was supposed to do and that it was ""normal"". I hate knowing that we had friends who knew our age differences, saw the stuff they did with me and didn't step in. They made it all seem so normal.
I think I cut them off when I was around 15 cause I felt like I was toxic to them. Haven't turned back since. I only realized like last year what they had done. I still don't think they were a truly bad person. Like I said, they went back and forth on our relationship alot. One second it was ""you're my SO"", next ""no you're not, this is wrong and illegal"" and finally ""you're special and mature so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] wait for you"". They were kind, sweet. Had a certain innocence to them. 

I found out they now have a new SO. From the information I could gather (which I had to do in small doses at a time as to not give myself really bad panic attacks), they met when the new person was 16 and they were in their early 20's. I found comments by the new person where they were sad about how they couldn't date cause it was technically illegal. Today they're legal, and so is the relationship. It makes me sick, thinking of the possibility that another person was put through the same things as me. Maybe they weren't a good person after all.
For the longest time I've contemplated contacting the new person and telling my story. But I can't. I just can't. I have no proof of it happening and if they found out I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to ""ruin"" their relationship, I don't know what could happen. I was a toxic person back then and I lashed out on them sometimes and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] they could use that to paint me as the bad guy you can't trust. So I don't really see the point. Besides, the relationship is legal now. I don't really know what I can do to prevent or change it.

This the first of several times I've been taken advantage of like this. But this the only time I could've prevented it happening to someone else, but didn't. I cannot tell you how guilty and disgusted I feel with myself, knowing I trusted this person, thought all of this was normal, and the fact that nobody stepped in and tried to help me.
I've only told my current SO this and my closest friend. Appreciate them both. But now you all know. 

Thank you for reading.",3
k7uhdn,1607264168.0,2020-12-06 14:16:08,offmychest,My heart hurts and I want to tell my story. It makes me feel better thinking about all of you out there. ♥️,"A couple of weeks ago, one of the little girls in my youth group died in a car wreck. I didn't know her super well. I haven't been a leader at that youth group for a few years now, but her death hit me really hard. I felt bad for grieving so much, because I felt like I didn't have the right. The thing is, she only has one sibling; an older sister. And the whole thing happened so close to home... they live right down the road from us. It felt like a close call... like it could have been my little sis. I felt wrecked and bereaved as though I had lost Jessie and yet I hadn't... I still don't understand that...why it hurt so much.I keep thinking about the correlation between social media usage and the rising number of people struggling with depression. I felt like I had been keeping up with the girl's family, even though I haven't talked to them in over a year. I think maybe the world is starting to mistake seeing someone's picture on Facebook for being with them. Maybe we are missing real human connection. Why is it that when I am [REDACTED_NAME], I want to post what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on Instagram or Facebook. Before social media, I always wanted to turn on the radio. I study better when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] noise or in a coffee shop... I don't know... I mean maybe other people don't struggle with this as much as I do... with not wanting to be alone. It's odd, because I get so overwhelmed when I am [REDACTED_NAME] around people.At first I think, well I need attention and that's why. Why do I need attention though? Who's attention do I want? And then I realized...I just want to be somebody worth remembering. Somebody people love and want to have around. But that leaves me wondering if I am [REDACTED_NAME] who even I love and would want to have around.This year I read a book called, The Road Back to You: An Enneagram Journey to Self-Discovery. An Enneagram is basically a personality type. There are 9 of them, and the whole idea is that our personality is actually a mask we wear (""persona"" = ""mask"" in latin.) We put them on when we are very little, while we are learning to deal with the world. In a way, it's like a defense mechanism. Now, I don't know how accurate it is, but it seems to be based on psychology and not astrology. ;) My type felt very on the nose... if that makes sense. The test told me that I am [REDACTED_NAME] 2: The Helper and that I fear being unloved and unwanted. Are you following my train of thought now?The book told me that the harmful message I heard from the world at around 3 years old was that I had to hide my needs and help others with theirs in order to be loved. That no one would want me if I didn't. Just typing that hurts because even telling you, feels like admitting my most intrinsic fear. My enneagram also struggles with pride.... ouch.I have been working and making money since I was 11 years old. I would babysit or clean houses. I even did a lot of yard work for people after giving them a very feminist, ""I can work just as hard as a boy"" speech. I would make money and spend it on my friends. I would buy them really nice presents and I would always pick up the bill when we hung out or went to lunch. I honestly felt and still feel like if I didn't do that, they wouldn't want to hang out with me. I couldn't bear the idea of telling them I couldn't afford it. It's hard to break that habit even now, but it's good to know my motivation. It helps me rationalize in the moment.I have been thinking about all of this, because I feel like I change who I am [REDACTED_NAME] I date someone. I know that I want to be a wife and a mother someday and that, personally, it's in my nature to be submissive; but I don't want to lose who I am [REDACTED_NAME] reaching for who I want to be. I want to be someone of substance and character. Someone whose beliefs don't change depending on who I'm [REDACTED_NAME].Recently, I read Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes. A timely read in my search of self. If you haven't read it, the book is about a mentally ill man named Charlie who undergoes surgery to become intelligent. At first, the operation succeeds far beyond what the surgeons and scientists had hoped. However, over time he recedes farther back in his mind until he is even more ill than he was in the beginning. During the peak of his intelligence, his mind is elevated to the status of great scholars and intellectuals and he says:“Although we know the end of the maze holds death (and it is something I have not always known--not long ago the adolescent in me thought death could happen only to other people), I see now that the path I choose through that maze makes me what I am. I am [REDACTED_NAME] only a thing, but also a way of being--one of many ways--and knowing the paths I have followed and the ones left to take will help me understand what I am [REDACTED_NAME].” ― Daniel Keyes, Flowers for AlgernonI loved this quote because I also believed that death could only happen to other people. It wasn't until they found a cyst in my brain that I started to feel differently. It's hard to live in denial when you wake up in the middle of the night throwing up. Feeling all the muscles in your face spasm and piercing pain in your ear because of the nerve damage leftover from Bell's palsy... feeling your arm shaking until it's in your shoulders and then falling into a fitful sleep for days at a time afterward. There was an illusion shattered during that time, that I was entitled to years or even hours of my life. The illnesses I had thought connected, ended up being smaller issues, all aggravated by stress, and anxiety. There were things that happened during that year that still haunt me. Things said and done to me that I didn't know how to stop. Too submissive. Too quiet. Fight, Flight, Freeze, or Faint...and I Froze. I'll tell you about some of those things, but the point of the quote is that they don't have to define where I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. They just helped me get to where I am. That's why I can be grateful now. Glad that what happened wasn't worse. It was a big lesson that I learned in the safest possible way. I think I loved Flowers for Algernon, because it was one giant admonition to those who take advantage of the weak.I am [REDACTED_NAME] all of these things up for a reason. Over this last year, I felt myself changing. I felt myself becoming weak in my mind. Weak in my convictions. Bereft of emotion. I felt myself ignoring my conscience and falling prey to sin that I could have easily overcome a few months earlier. I became irritable, and unhappy. Impatient and proud. I don't want my friends to feel like I am [REDACTED_NAME] condescending. Giving advice when I haven't earned the right or the wisdom. I don't want to be someone who listens just to reply. I became someone I hated. I hated myself ever having considered marrying John. He would have been emotionally abusive and manipulative. I would have fallen into the same trap that I fell into at the pizza shop. Why am I like this? What is it I want or feel I need?That's what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to figure out. I don't know if I ever will figure all of it out. There were days where on my way home from therapy, I would think that I knew. That I had solved it. But then I'd wake up from another nightmare and wonder why I was still having those. It's always the same. I am [REDACTED_NAME] a building, somewhere with aisles like the make-line at the pizza shop. Maybe a grocery store. Maybe a hallway. And he's closing the distance. He's so much taller than me and I can't move. And just when he is about to get to me, I wake up shaking.I want to tell you what happened, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] to get this out in writing. Mostly because I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I didn't do more to stand up for myself. My trauma wasn't huge. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to use the word trauma. I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I was so sensitive. But it's an important part in understanding who I am.When I turned 17, I had just graduated a year early from High School. I graduated with a 4.0GPA and I had a lot of high opinions of myself. Somehow, I got offered a job at Target on the same day I got offered a job at the pizza shop. I turned Target down with the hope that I would be promoted faster at the pizza shop. It was the first time I had prayed about a decision and felt peace about which way to move forward. I was a crew member for the first 7 months and I worked 40+ hours/week. I covered for every shift I could and I made it my goal to save up enough money for college. The owner started to take a special interest in me. Often he would use me as an example of good behavior in store meetings. He would praise my work and he made me head cashier very quickly. As time went on, he would walk me around the store, ""coaching me"" as he called it. The first time he yelled at me, it was more like a whisper. I was helping customers and they said something nice about me to him. They left and he walked up to me and put his hands on my shoulders. He walked me over to the another section of the register and pushed me up against it (this was an area I had been warned not to touch because it was essentially his desk) and he whispered very angrily, ""If you ever want to cashier here again, you'll clean up you're mess..."" and the rest I can't remember. I thought that was how it was at entry-level jobs. There was always something illegal happening. It's better the devil you know...so I let it go. I cried while doing dishes the rest of that night and I told myself that I would do better next time. I would make him proud. I felt it was my fault.These little abuses continued and they got increasingly worse after each promotion. My therapist told me that I had developed a trauma bond with him. It enabled me to see past a lot of things that any rational person wouldn't have put up with. He would yell until I was crying and then he would make fun of me. I would follow him around the store or he would pull my arm to follow him. He would yell at me if the person who closed didn't put the stapler back on the right side of the register. If the person who swept left an olive under the make-line. If the person who restocked soda didn't twist the sodas so the labels faced the front. I was called a pig with lipstick on. I was told that he would yell until I was fleshless on the ground begging for mercy. All said in a way that could be mistaken for a joke...but he was yelling it. And I would freeze up. Unable to speak without sobbing.One day I braided my hair when I put it up. He liked it so much that anytime I wore my hair any other way, he would tell me to go in the back and fix my hair. Under all the pressure, I turned the 10th busiest Papa Murphy's in the nation into a [REDACTED_ADDRESS]ore. I hired good people and trained them. I trained new franchisees and showed them how to run their store. I sold potential franchisees on the idea of owning a store. I felt like I had to please him. His voice was always in my head. I had to win his approval. I had to be his favorite. I was working 76 hrs/week, 12 of which were off the clock. I had to get there early enough to fix the close from the night before and stay late enough to ensure a better close that night.This guy was so insane in retrospect. He would fold 20's a certain way and I was supposed to figure out how much change we needed in 1's, 5's, and quarters just based on how they were folded. He would get angry if I asked and he would time me when I went to the bank and yell if I was gone longer than he thought I should have been. He wanted me to be first in line and if I came back late, he assumed I wasn't.One day, a few weeks after finding out I had Bell's palsy, I got to work and I went to pull dough out of the fridge. I will never forget standing in the fridge and being able to smell his cologne.  I felt my heart start racing, cold sweat, and I was shaking. I was having a panic attack. Because I knew he had to be right around the corner. That at any second, he would be yelling at me again. And I realized that for all the money in the world, I didn't want to live like that anymore. So I went home and I wrote my notice.I made it to the 8th day of my two weeks before losing it. The sadistic regional manager came in to ""help"" that day. One of the Spanish ladies that worked in the morning was taking the trash out and he got in my face and told me it was the job of whoever closed the night before. I started to speak and he spit ""Bullshit!"" I say spit, because he spit on my face when he said it. He was a foot away from me. I tried to cool down and put the produce away, but I couldn't stop crying. I was having another panic attack. So I took my break and I called my dad. I told him I couldn't take another day of it. So he told me to just leave. Until that moment, I honestly didn't believe I could do that. So, still crying, I went back inside. I closed out my register, I grabbed my bag, put my apron on the counter and I started walking out. The regional manager asked me where I was going and I said, ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with the harassment."" and he said, ""what harassment?!"" and I said, ""Your screaming, Greg's screaming (the owner)... I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Derek has my key."" and I left.Typing this has been really hard and I know it is all over the place. Be patient with me. Sometimes I have to talk about smaller subjects before I get to the bigger one that is really bothering me.Leaving there, I went to work for a coffee shop. When I was making coffee during training, I spilled and burned my arm. Everyone laughed because it was a rookie mistake. A minor burn, but I ran to the bathroom anyway because it had triggered a panic attack. I cried and sat on the floor. I actually felt like he was going to come around the corner and hurt me. It scared me so much because, rationally, I knew he didn't work there. That he didn't even know I worked there.That's when I started to go to therapy.  I still pass Papa Murphy's on my way to work. Every time I do, I consider stopping in. A trauma bond is like that. According to PsychCentral.com, ""Trauma bonding is loyalty to a person who is destructive.""I know that what happened to me sucks. But I also know it could have been way worse. That I got lucky. When I repeated my mistake and dated John...I hated myself. Because I don't want to be a victim. I don't want to be quiet and submissive. To be run over like some helpless deer. So I have been taking a self-defense class and a kickboxing class. I have been preparing for the worst so I don't have to feel so scared all the time by stupid things.I don't have panic attacks nearly as often now. I work for a good company and I stay home a lot otherwise. I started running and lost a bunch of weight after everything happened. I have become someone I can count on. I can say that now. So I guess I'm [REDACTED_NAME] dating, because I want to make sure I believe in myself without having a back up plan. Without needing a guy to validate me or contradict my insecurities. I want to feel empowered by myself before I invite someone in.The Bible says: ""Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction."" Isaiah 48:10I truly believe that my experience is exactly that. A refining fire. Something that will make me stronger for storms ahead. Something that will give me more empathy. Something that will help me encourage other people who are hurting.I have to be careful not to use what happened as an excuse to stay a victim. I don't usually talk about it. I used to. I used to tell people about it all the time, because I needed someone to confirm how crazy all of it was. I needed someone to take my side. Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to understand why I still have nightmares. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to find a pattern and identify the causation. How do I end up in these situations and why.Part of me thinks that I am [REDACTED_NAME] for validation from men...but that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. My own dad loves me and is proud of me. He never hit me or even yelled. He would raise his eyebrow and I'd stop whatever I was doing. He always went out of his way to show up for me. He is the word's greatest dad in my eyes. So I don't think I have ""daddy issues""...  I don't know if I'll figure it out tonight and I've practically written a book about it. If you are still reading, I'll leave you with this quote from C.S. Lewis and a request. Be kind to people. People wearing uniforms. People on the other end of the phone. No one is insignificant and your words have more power than you know. Use that power for good and be kind or don't say anything at all.“There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors. This does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn. We must play. But our merriment must be of that kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously - no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption.” ― C.S. Lewis, The Weight of GloryUntil next time,~ Frankie",5
gvlwuq,1591153807.0,2020-06-03 03:10:07,offmychest,#whyididntreport was trending on twitter and I wanted to tell my story but I felt like it didn’t count and I still didn’t want my family to know,"He didn’t rape me. He didn’t touch me inappropriately near private areas. I just don’t know what to think anymore really 

The ball started rolling when someone I considered a close family member had set up his phone in my room facing where I would change my clothes. I found it and deleted the video, honestly I don’t know why, there was a moment where I thought to send it to myself to keep as proof but I didn’t. I felt violated and I made sure to keep my distance after but looking back to when I was younger it makes me feel dirty and stupid. I knew of these kinds of predators but I didn’t think it would happen to me. My mom would even tell me if a family member puts hands on me that I was uncomfortable with then to tell her. So why didn’t I ? I’m scared to tell her now because I think she’ll believe it was her fault when it wasn’t. 

My brothers and I messed with him a lot so he would get us back by throwing pillows at us and sometimes chased us down. There was one moment where I threw something at him and he tried tickling me but ended up pinning me down on the bed and I didn’t think much of it. It was just retaliation like all the other times. Another occurrence was when my brothers and I slept over at his house. We slept on the floor while he slept on his bed. I remember waking up and finding him under the blanket “sleeping” but right next to me. I thought it was weird but I didn’t think much of it. It makes me shake thinking about whether he did anything to me or did I wake up just in time. 

As I grew up into my teen years, I would be laying on the bed and he would come in and smack my ass. At first it was just haha funny. But then I slowly became upset about it and I would tell him to stop. He still continued to do it but I brushed it off as “oh this is how he treats my other cousins too”. After the video occurrence all of it has made me realize it wasn’t nothing. But at the same time he didn’t rape me. He didn’t assault me. But I felt/feel violated and I’m scared of what speaking up would do. Would my family believe me? I beat myself up whenever I think about it because I should’ve sent that video to myself. I shouldn’t have just erased it, at least I would’ve had proof then.",6

Death to who you think you are

Chapter one: The briefing

If we want to get the feeling of the beginning we have to start from the real beginning. I don’t remember the real age but I was very young. We shall say somewhere from one to two. I got to spend time with my real father and that leads down a bad path. From what I was told, being older that is. I had gotten soap in my eye and I cried nonstop and my dad hit me in the face. Now, this wasn’t some normal hit or love tap of being out of order. This was a young baby with now a fractured skull and an innocent child that now will start his journey in life on the wrong foot. My mother took my real father out to court over custody and needless to say he did not show and my mother had taken me home safe from something every happening again. We can kind of fast forward from this point to about the age of four to five. My life consists of my mother, my grandfather and my grandmother. My mom at this point had brought me around a lot of people and for me being a kid I didn’t know a lot, but we never went around someone I shouldn’t be around. But then my mother brought this guy around. We shall call him Lewis. he was a cool guy we got along well with and with me not having that father figure around it was cherished in a way that not a lot of people will get. Towards the end of me being my five-year-old self, my mother had gotten married to Lewis. It was a beautiful wedding and my mom was herself, everything just seemed right as a child, happiness is simple when you are that age I guess. We had lived in a small town in a house that my mother had purchased around the same time as the wedding, also along with that was a few brand new cars. Life was good as a child at least that’s what it looked like. The next few years flew past I had a new father and my mother was happy just everything was right. Now first thing’s first I was not a super poor child or I mostly got what I wanted being an only child. But as little as I knew things were going to change and I had no idea.

Around the age of ten is when things started to fall out of place and was a downward spiral until I started my new journey. My mother never had a good record with health but that goes for most of us in the family. She had suffered from numerous strokes and back issues due to a car accident that changed her life. Many hospitals and doctors’ offices had been visited with the journey I’ve taken with my mother. But we shall also get deeper into that. At this time in life, my mother was going through changes that I did not understand. She was sick and also trying to have a baby some time went on and things seemed well with my mother but something inside as a kid told me things were only starting and boy was I right. Around this time of me being nine to ten my mother had lost over ten miscarriages, I mostly don’t know the real reasons why that was but I’m sure if I wasn’t told correctly it was to make it seem like everything will be okay in the end. But many times I knew about having a sibling and sometimes it was just oh the stork or something didn’t make it, you know the things we were all fed as kids so we just didn’t ask questions. Finally, a miracle for my mother and Lewis happened. They got pregnant with my younger sister. That was a long 9 months with my mother for sure. But once my sister was born there were problems that I didn’t understand fully. She had been put on a machine that was attached to her heart, as a kid, this was terrifying to see someone you love in that situation because as myself-going through something life-changing likes that. At this age is when I started getting “Stuck in my head”. My grandfather raised me showing me to always be observant and have your back to a corner so no one can come up from behind you. At a young age, I was taught a lot in a short time. Because on top of my mother having issues and my grandmother was also sick at the same time with this thing called cancer that I had no idea what it was or how harsh of a thing it was. But at that age, I realized something was wrong. Wrong…  I started spending time with my grandparents more and more and I wouldn’t leave their side. That’s when I had realized these are my parents and my haven. Now don’t get me wrong my mother is my mother and I will love that woman no matter what I say or do. But she also knows what I mean by this statement and as for most of you know that’s just how having grandparents is. At this time I committed my time to my grandmother though. Like I had friends and stuff in school but nothing meant more to me than going to see her after school or on the weekend just honestly any time. I was learning so much from her how to cook, clean, do laundry or even just something like gardening. I was learning so much at such a fast pace I was blinded to the fact that this woman, my haven, my grandmother was dying and I had not the slightest clue. In this short time of ten to about twelve is where I learned how to become an adult very early. I was on a mission and I had no idea.

Chapter two: The blindfolded truth

In the time of me being around my grandmother, I have seen things people will never see in their lifetime and things that you couldn’t even process in your head. This section will be about my Grandmother and just my journey with a woman who was the purest person you could ever meet.

The time of realizing my grandmother was sick I picked up even harder on being there making sure she knew I loved her. Around when I did start to notice was when she started losing her hair. To me, she was still a beautiful woman no matter how she looked because her soul was so pure you could just feel it in the atmosphere around you. You can see the sickness in her eyes, you can see the thoughts, the worry and the pain. But she never broke character; she never let us know how much it bothered her. Until one afternoon she had gone into the bathroom. She had collapsed and I had heard it. I ran to that door as fast as I could but it was locked. I had no response from her but I knew I needed to get in here. I knew this was not good. Soon my mother and grandfather came to help. We got that door open and we had many smelling salts planted around the house and this was a time we had to use one. As my grandmother laid there hopeless, unconscious and looking lifeless my heart dropped emptiness grew inside my head and my heart and my soul started to feel like it was being torn out of me. I had to have been around the age of ten to eleven when this had happened. It was all like a daze, something that wouldn’t go away as the EMS got there and they had stabilized her enough to get her to the hospital. Across this time frame this was very normal she lived at chemo or the hospital or doctors. The chemo at this rate had been burning her because of how often and strong the treatments were. My grandmother used to sit there and not be coherent or not know who she was or sometimes the grandkids or her husband. We all understood though. We all knew this was going to be a long ride or this was going to end soon and none of us wanted that to happen. She was progressively getting sicker and there was nothing I could do about it. We moved forward and did all the things we needed to do for her and as a family we were one of the strongest families around no questions asked. One day she had gotten a call or was at the hospital or something along with that nature and she was told that the doctor that had done her test reading had read it wrong and she was given the wrong treatments of chemo. (Leukemia lymphoma) Fill with info!).

So for that time of around 2 years of treatments they were treating her wrong and with that kind of treatment being wrong they were just put here in a microwave and frying her. By this time there wasn’t very much to do. There was only one shining light of hope and it was this amazing doctor from Pittsburgh that took care of my grandmother. She trusted this man to save her life, as did we all. All within a month, we had to film a documentary with the attorney that was handling the case with my grandmother and that’s when we all kind of knew this wasn’t going to end well. After all the filming and stuff was done it had started to run into the holidays and man they just were not the same and you could tell. She had been in Pittsburgh at this time staying in a hotel room right across the hospital where it was filtered air and just everything was super clean. Her prepping had come to an end and it was time.

The family gathered at west Penn before the surgery. The drive was quiet but I knew everyone was just in their thoughts as was I. I had hoped due to the percent that she had told us of making it through it all. Which to us kids was around 80 percent; you know something to make it easier on the grandkids to understand. We all gathered in this waiting room and the room filled with silence for a bit you can just feel the tension in the room and that’s not what my grandmother wanted. She wanted us to be ourselves, talk and be a family and we did it just to break the ice. We all know my grandmother was the one to break that ice. We all talked and the time we had seemed so short but all said and done it was time to go. My mother and I wanted to stay just in case we needed to be here. But my grandfather was not having it he wanted everyone to go home and relax for the night. Remind you if something happens we are an hour plus away. Well, Lewis had calmed my mother down to the point where we all went home. The night grew old and sitting in my room thinking she will be okay I'll just call her tomorrow. Now, this is where the nightmare became a reality. I had woken up early to dead silence, my stomach turning and head spinning, it felt like a movie a haze filling the room but not just the feeling there is. I walked downstairs to my mother making coffee and I just remember looking at her and I said I don’t feel right something is wrong, she also had the same feelings. Shortly after the phone rang, it was like a horror movie. She raced to pick up the phone and it was my grandfather. Mostly all that was said to me was we needed to get the whole family there as quickly as possible. We scattered and collected the family and drove my mother to make it there in around a half-hour to forty-five minutes. We pulled in and I had my great grandmother in a wheelchair. We rushed to where we needed to be in no time. As we got to the final stretch to see her my heart was racing hands shaking. My heart slows as we approach

The room. I see these women in this bed that I had no idea who she was. I had thought maybe I had the wrong room or something. I just remember looking at the nurse and saying that isn’t my grandmother. She had gained a massive amount of water weight and she was attached to this machine with all these clear tubes running a tank and in that tank was the blood that was being cycled out and back in because her body couldn’t do it by itself. We were told she can hear but she cannot respond or open her eyes. A large part of me died in a matter of minutes. A cold shiver went up my spine rapidly into my brain and everything lost colors and feelings and it got really cold. We were pulled into another room to talk to the doctor about what was going on and what had happened and you can tell a lot of hate and anger went right to him in the room. But as we were explained she crashed the percent we were all told was indeed super low the real percent was only five and she had made it through that five percent chance. The issue was cancer got so bad it had taken over and this is where a choice changed the lives of many.

One thing I will never wish someone has to do is to choose someone if they live or die. The switch of never seeing someone again, seeing their smile or feel the love from someone again. While they made this decision I got to spend a few last moments with her to where she could hear me. Things no one has ever heard but us two. Those things didn't let anyone forget her. I was sorry if I didn’t say I loved you enough and that I’ll take care of grandpa. I just don’t want you to go but it will be okay and if you can’t do it by yourself it is okay to let go someday we'll all understand. At that moment she squeezed my hand with all she had in her and a tear fell from her eye. I knew it was time I knew this was the goodbye that I had nightmares about sleepless nights. Shortly my mother returned and we talked to her some more and then the rest of the family had said their goodbyes. As I sat there in my chair in the waiting room I waited and waited and then the real meaning of empty had filled me, a ring in my ear it had felt like I watched my heart and mind get sliced in half before me. The room filled with silence again and the ringing stopped…

She was gone but she had let go before the machine had been turned off and you could tell. Peace had filled the air for just a brief minute knowing she had never had to deal with the pain and suffering. But the anger and hate grew with the pain and my head was spinning and I just couldn’t believe it, I didn’t want to believe it. What seemed like maybe a half hour I was with my grandfather helping him collect her things and her from the apartment they were staying at once we had all of the things we had left. The drive had felt like hours and hours had gone by not much was said not many tears were shed either. We all had finally gathered at their house. Blank faces across the room, silent tears running slowly down everyone's faces. No one knew what to say. You can tell everyone wanted to comfort one another but you just couldn’t find the words to speak. Some of what happened is just a blur to me. The next thing I know we arrived at the funeral. Smelled of overpowering perfume, you can feel that certain people did not belong here. You can tell my mom was losing a grip on reality; she hadn’t eaten much, slept or even showered much. She wanted my grandmother’s funeral to be perfect and it was as perfect as it could have been. The day went on and it was our times to say our final goodbyes. The effect was kicking in at this rate the women, my mother, my grandmother, and my hero was gone. She would never get to see me grow up, graduate or even get married and have kids someday. MY life had felt like nothing but over. I don’t remember much at the time of burying her. I mostly stayed in the car. We had stuck around my grandfathers for a while every day in and out eventually he had won the lawsuit against the hospital and the doctor that had made the mistake of his life. I don’t remember the exact numbers but the set amount was a million dollars after taxes, lawyer fees and all that he still has a decent amount left. My mother and her two brothers received a good chunk of money out of this from my grandfather. Everyone did something good with it and did well with the money for the most part. But there was another turning point in life that we didn’t know was about to happen.

Chapter Three: The distraction

My grandfather is a hell of a man. That man would give you the skin off his back. He has also taught me about life and god and hunting just all the things a father would teach their child. My grandfather was in a car accident when I was very young. He was bedridden for some time; he worked down at the steel mill; he was one of the big guys down there. He claims to me that I was the reason he wanted to make it through the pain and suffering to live. He says I saved his life and I see that but little does he know he is what kept me alive all these years as a person. He was the father I never had. That man put his life into me and I’ve also done the same as best as I can. But when my grandmother had passed away he had felt an empty feeling that I will never understand and neither will anyone else in this world. It was his wife, his partner, his everything and she was just gone. He always had a good poker face but little does he know he taught me to be so observant that I can feel things in a matter of seconds I can feel things by looking into people’s eyes. But his poker face became a part of his life. He had gone to Vegas numerous times to play Texas Holdem and slots. He had gambled his pain away and no money in the world can ever take that pain away. You can’t replace that feeling no matter how hard you try. At this time I was trying to be around and be his grandson but I also was failing myself. I gave up on myself. So instead I started a new thing. I took my pain and turned it into healing others since I knew I understood people more than they thought I could do this. Well, an incident happened where I forgot my grandfather was in Vegas for weeks. We had talked briefly and he had some scrap in the back. I was going to clean up the house so when he returned it had some life back in and we got to make a few bucks because he didn’t want the scrap money. When I had gotten out back the door was inched open I had told my friend to go out to the front just to make sure they didn't run out the front if there was someone there. I searched everywhere I could and no one was found. His girlfriend he now had which was only like 8 months after my grandmother’s death. Which we will cover that soon also. But anyway she had walked in and had asked why I was there and I explained myself and everything went bat shit crazy my mother showed up, mind you she hated this lady. Some arguments happened and my grandfather called in the middle of everything and he wanted all the keys back whoever had one and none of us were to step foot on the property. A while went on and I and he hadn’t spoken. But one night I and Lewis got into a very heated argument and I had packed my shit and went to the haven I thought I had. Only to get there and have him look me in my eyes and tell me I’m not welcome there. At that point, I hadn’t had anything. I was failing out of school. My mother wouldn’t leave her bed. Lewis was out cheating on my mother because of how mentally unstable my mother was. Now at this time frame, I had been running around with the wrong crew. People who stole didn’t have a home. I was around fifteen to sixteen getting drunk and smoking weed and just not giving a care in the world what happened to me. 2009 is when I knew I had been around the wrong people. One night I had gone to a party just for a birthday with some food and a fire. Towards the end of the night, some kid had flipped the table and knocked everything off the table well when I had gone to leave I had picked up all the stuff being respectful and one of the items was a wallet. Well, I had turned it over to the owner of the home and went on my way. Several days later I had been with my girlfriend at the time and I had received a phone call from a cousin. Asking how I was and what I was up to. Now my mother had just gotten off the phone with me and had told me to come straight home. When my cousin had asked I hesitated a while and asked where. Well, she had said the school is only 100 yards from my front door. So we went… As we pulled in there were people flooded in the parking lot and the jungle gym all familiar faces. As the car came to a stop we started a conversation. The names of these men will not be named for this. They know who they are. I was asked if I had seen a wallet and I had stated yes because I did. I told him what it looked like but I did not open it. I had handed it to the owner of the home and he was there. He looked at me and said listen he’s telling the truth I told you leave him alone. Something was screamed in the background and after that it was black. I remember thinking to myself I was dead there was no way I was getting out of this. Eventually, I had come to and all I have seen was my girlfriend over my body and she was getting hit over and over and over again it had been over 45 minutes and the worst part about it is. I had a whole text written to my mom to come over to the school and call the police but as I was hitting send it when I got hit in my face. Eventually, we had gotten away and driven. I couldn’t move. I felt super drunk but I just kept hearing he’s dead. I just closed my eyes and next I was being helped out of the car. This burst of energy exploded in me when I saw she was hurt. I also ran in the house and went right for the shotgun that was always in the closet. But it wasn’t there. It was already loaded in the back of Lewis’s car shortly after my grandfather had rolled into the parking area. I had gone to sit in the back of his car and he had all of his guns with him also. Shortly after that, the police had shown up with 2 of the men who had assaulted me. The anger I had I told that cop and them you had 1 minute to get off the property or id kill all 3 of them and not think twice of it. He had gone to turn them in and an EMS had shown up shortly after that. I wasn’t worried about myself. I knew I’d walk away. I was more worried about my girlfriend at the time. Which ended up being a total joke? I had over 10 blunt traumas to the head, slightly torn iris; I developed TMJ in the jaw neck and back problems due to how much I was beaten. But something in me wouldn’t let it be about me. I just couldn’t let it be about me. That’s not how I was raised. Well, I never returned to school because all of them went to the same school and having to deal with 46 individuals in a small area was not ideal for me. Also yes 46 people now 3 days after that had happened to me. The person who had stolen the wallet returned it to the owner of it. So now something that happened to me was pointless I had almost gotten killed over some paperwork for the military and around 10 dollars in weed. Needless to say, the people who deserved what they got did get what they had coming to them. My grandfather and I started spending time together again slowly and it was something that I needed but also was just me masking my real feelings towards my life and the situations I was in.

Chapter Four: Meeting darkness

At this point in my life, I had slowly figured out how to deal with depression and what I can do to make time pass. I accepted that I meant nothing. So I focused on everyone around me. I tried to help fix my mother, my grandfather also looked over my siblings in the mix. I had a girlfriend different one this time. I was around 23 to 25 at this point. She helped with the things wrong in my head and she created this weird feeling in my chest like you swallowed a napkin which sounds stupid but it’s a good thing. She was beautiful no matter what with makeup, without it didn’t matter this girl was smoking hot to me. Her eyes and smile were pretty weird too but it just fit with me. It felt like I met the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. But here was the major problem with that. My stupid ass didn’t realize I was just getting worse by bottling up my feelings and not expressing myself because let’s face the hard truth of this world. We Men Aren't the Way We Should Be. It’s called being the stableman and the men that grow up without a real father have to be the man of the house for their mothers. But anyway sorry about that rant just if you’re a dude reading this I get it and believe me express those feelings it draws people closer. So anyway I drained this girl she tried so hard to help me and I knew she loved me but when I felt she was trying to step into an area that no one was allowed my walls came right up. So I didn’t trust her. I began to not care anymore. I pushed her away like I had done to everyone in my life at this point. But when I realized in reality I was losing her, I panicked and tried everything in my will to get this girl back. But needless to say, she was gone. The pain grew and my brain felt too big for my head, like if I didn’t talk to someone or do something I was going to explode. This next part is a hard one for me to write down on paper let alone put out there for someone to read so bear with me while I try to explain some things. There are a few times I had almost taken my life 3 to be exact. The first one was after this stunt I had pulled on probably the best thing that had ever happened to me. I sat there one-night drunk. I had around 2 bottles of Smirnoff 100 proof vodka blue cap clear bottles. I was down at the dam around my house. I was in my lifted piece of shit jeep just existing. All I could think about was I mean nothing. I have no one, my family fell apart, my girl left, I didn’t have a job, I didn’t live. I lay in the water and went under holding my breath hoping to just fall asleep. Something weirdly pulled me, it felt like the tide had tugged me, it felt like hey you can’t do this get outta here. I sat on that beach for 4 hours and cried my night away. I knew this darkness in my head was getting worse. I knew I had lost control. Several days had gone by and things got better again for a little while. I didn’t want to die but no one wants to die. We just feel that way. Days grew to months which led to me getting a job working at FedEx. Now at this time I was doing pretty good and had money for a car and a job. It was all falling into place where I wanted it to be. As I spent while at FedEx I loved the job and just hated who I worked for with the contractor there. I just bought a brand new car. 2019 Civic sport with all blacked out everything SI wheels the whole nine-man…I felt on top of the world. My grandfather was in my life everyday. My mom was doing good. She had moved and was living in Florida with this new guy who wasn’t so bad. Dude just needs to open up to her but that’s none of my business I guess, whatever mom. Anyway, life was making sense. I just struggled with the fact that my grandmother was not there to see all the progress I had made. Also, I wish the girl who had left me was there to see all the steps I made to make my life better. Now notice that the last part of the sentence I made my life better not myself. I tricked my head once again into thinking everything was okay. Well, the girl had come back into my life shortly but again disappeared which hurt just as bad as the first time. This leads me into round 2 the time I thought my life was going to end. The same spot I go at the lake to go into my head I was there just thinking about I was just sitting there and over and over again in my head I said if I’m gone all the problems tied to me go away. Mind you I never told anyone where I was but somehow a friend showed up and talked to me and realized how hard I was crashing and falling. I owe that man my life debt I can never pay but oddly he related to me and understood some of the pain. So once again we are back on this train of I think I’m fixing myself but little did I know this was only me getting right back into the mix. Several months have passed and I have gotten a new job. Working with driving again and tires now. Easy job I loved , boss , was awesome, worked with a friend and coworkers was awesome, so once again I thought I was on track again mentally and physically. Now I have a new girlfriend, a sparky character. I think I was more into the feeling of having someone than anything because I thought I loved this girl. But one night I was down bowling with my grandfather and I had stumbled over and caught myself feeling hot and dizzy . I felt like I was going to just drop dead. But I dragged myself to my car and tried my hardest to make it look like I was okay truth be I couldn’t see anything driving to the hospital I just kept saying I’m dying kind of laughed with my sense of humor like really dude stroke while bowling’s going to take my ass out like this is how I go out? Fuck me right now I haven’t touched this subject because it’s still hard to deal with on a small scale but that’s strokes I have had 4 in total by the age of 25. Also on top, I’ve had 2 mini heart attacks. The time I’m speaking of is the 3rd one I’ve had. So I get to the hospital walk-in and check-in, I wait about 10 minutes for someone to see me and tell her with half of my body working I think I’m having a stroke. I said to that lady I’m one of those people who aren’t in a rush when it comes to my problems, shortly after I fell to the ground. I opened my eyes and I was in a room with a laptop and the man was talking to me about some pill he wanted to give me. I thought I was dreaming or hallucinating. I just remember him running simple tests of lifting my left leg and left arm. My face was sagging and I just can only help to remember thinking all these times I wished I was dead and I tried to fix them and this is it for me. I can hear the man in front of me but it was kind of like the faint echo of a voice. He said something along the lines of whatever this pill was to clean the clothes in my brain but if they were not in my head there was a small chance I would die on the table in 15 to 20 minutes. I rejected and took a deep breath. I leaned back and I tape played in my head from when I was little playing in the kitchen with my shadow to the moment laying in this bed that smelled like death and after 6 days I had returned to work. Now the reason I think I had the stroke is kind of selfish but is the only thing that makes sense is the most recent ex, not the one who left me because I was fucked in the head but one more after her. I was so stressed out I had lost her and I was losing my job and just once again just my whole life crashed and folded on top of me. I felt like fucking have died over and over again one day after the next the problems pile the bills stack the car gets repo’d I have a room a bed and a computer. I was in my prison and I had no way out even though the door was unlocked. It was like I was drowning in air and no matter how hard I breathed in I was running out of time. I had one friend by my side and that was my choice. I had pushed everyone away. I started smoking cigarettes again pack or 2 a day depending on the days I was smoking weed again but sadly that was my way out. I spent 4 months high every day from the time I rolled out of bed till I closed my eyes but see I was mellow I was happy I found a form of an inner peace that let me talk to my ego and sort something’s out of course I started small on the list of things I wasn’t so much worried about like a job and a car and all that those things come over time and work and right now I need to work on myself. So I was in this haze for these months and I learned a lot about myself and things I didn’t know I could do. I was getting my creativity back and my head was clearing and I just enjoyed who I was again. But this was the beginning of feeling good and happy and just flipping my world because the journey has only begun.",3
f1dj7u,1581276167.0,2020-02-09 19:22:47,offmychest,I 21M Have been obsessive about my date 19F. I just realize what i did. I need help/advices.,"Hi,

This is my first time posting on Reddit, as i came to the realization that I've hit rock bottom and that it's time to seek help.

I  apologize, the story is very long. I wanted to share as many details as  possible. This is also a way for me to confess, as i have a tendency to  keep everything for myself.

About me:

I'm  a guy, in his 20s, and I'm a university student. School is going really  well for me, i'll soon graduate with a GPA well over 4.0. I have good  friends that i enjoy spending time with. However, I struggle other other  aspects of my life, notably love. I've dated 4 girls in my life, and now  that i think of it, it never ended well.

Also,  I have been struggling with depression for three years now, and when i  went to the doctor to talk about it i dismissed the frequent panic  attacks I've had. He prescribed me prozac, but I stopped taking it 2  years ago, as i didn't see any effects after 6 month of use. I haven't  taken antidepressant since, and I've learned to dismiss suicidal  thoughts that cross my mind at least once a week, mostly because i tell  myself that they're unjustified. I've been generally feeling numb, and  haven't had a panic attack since 2018.

Now the story:

I've  met this girl a few months ago (October I believe), on a dating app. We  chatted a bit and then exchanged numbers. We attempted to meet up a few  times, but we were both too busy with our lives and kinda moved on. I  sent to her that i don't have any free time anymore, so i couldn't meet  anytime soon. I deleted all dating apps to focus on schoolwork. Fast  forward to January, I had more free time, i decided to try out another  app. I saw her profile on it, I swiped right and she did too. At that  time, i was going on many dates as I was full of energy and highly  confident. She sent me a text, and i replied. I agreed for a date the  next week. It didn't go too well at first, but then we started to loosen  up with the alcohol, and we ended up staying up until late at the  night. We agreed to a second date, the following week. Things were going  great. i offered her to go back at my place to call an Uber, as its  pretty close to the bar we were at. Things got heated, we ended up  having our first kiss and then we had sex. But it couldn't have gone  worse, the condom failed and she wasn't on the pill. I called an Uber  and we went to the pharmacy to get plan B. I bought her some chocolate.  She didn't appear stressed, we kissed goodbye and then we both took an  Uber to our respective homes. She texted me to thank me for the night  despite what happened, and i thanked her too. I told her that i hoped to  see her soon, and that if she felt stressed out by the plan B  situation, she could call me at anytime during the night.

After  i said that to her, this is where my mind started breaking down. I  cried myself to sleep, as i felt immense guilt that this happened. I  felt guilt for putting her in this situation, in my head this was  entirely my fault. The next morning, I went to study as usual. The thing  is, I had the habit to go study at her university library, as its  closer, is opened 24/7 and has more restaurants nearby than my  university. I texted her to tell her I was there to study, and that if  she wanted to she could come and see me. She said ok, that she'll be  there in a bit. 2hrs later, she didnt text me so i texted her again.  can't remember what i said, but then i texted her again to ask if she  wanted to take a coffee break. she didn't reply. Then later, she said  she was leaving but came up to say hi. We hugged, then we talked a bit  and parted away. This is when i invaded her space. I didn't see it then,  and i mistakenly thought i was being thoughtful, and that I was doing  this to be ""with her while she goes through the symptoms of plan B"". I  thought that this was the right thing to do, not to abandon her in this.  I didn't get the signals that she needed space. I went to study again  the next day, at the same library. I didn't tell her i was there, and we  happened to see eachother when i was leaving. She said hello, but  didn't stop and continued walking. I broke down. I later sent her a text  telling her ""Sorry if I appeared off today, i'm [REDACTED_NAME] sick and i'm [REDACTED_NAME] home"". She replied some time later that she needed space because  of everything that was going on in her life. It was really polite,  without any harsh feelings. But I took it as a rejection, I felt  abandoned for reasons that are still unknown to me. I sent a very long  text, telling that i was respecting her choice, and that i keep fond  memories of our dates. Then i sent a second text, telling her that i'll  refrain to go to the library she goes to, and that i'll stop texting her  if she wants me to. She didn't reply, and i respected her will for two  weeks. I was devastated. I kept replaying all my interactions with her  (which is why I remember every detail of it while writing this). I would  think of her all the time for the entire two weeks. She didn't leave my  mind, i couldn't focus on anything. I ignored my friends. I was  constantly on the verge of a panic attack, kept biting my lips until  they bled, my heart kept racing, I had constant racing thoughts about  her and about my life.

Then, it  was soon going to be valentines day. I impulsively asked her out via  text and broke her will for space. I disrespected her. She said no, and  said i should never contact her again. My mind went blank. I sent two  long texts, essentially trying to justify my behaviour. I didn't blame  her for anything, but i was out of my mind. The text was literal  insanity. I puked after sending those two. I went numb after sending  those, and went to sleep. I didn't sleep at all, i felt like i had  fever. The next morning, i deleted her contact, deleted all SMS from  her, so i could have no way to talk to her. This was yesterday. I came  to the realization that my behaviour looked like what a stalker would  do, and everything became clear. I am [REDACTED_NAME], i didn't think i was  capable of such a disgusting behaviour. The worst part of this is that i  did it unconsciously. For me, it was perfectly normal. I thought i was  sane, but now i came to realize that i am [REDACTED_NAME]. At all. I wish i could  apologize to her for making her feel unsafe, hounded and disrespected  and i wish i could tell her i realized my behaviour was despicable. But  that would be breaking her will once again...

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] worried that she feels unsafe now. That I'm [REDACTED_NAME] as a danger,  because the last text i sent showed how unstable I was, even if it was  only self loathing and apologizing riddled with anxiety. I will of  course disappear completely from her life.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to take an appointment with a psychologist tomorrow, but i wonder  if i should actually go to a psychiatrist. I'll probably have to wait  for a long time before seeing the psychologist as they're all overbooked  and my university doesn't have an efficient mental health facility.

I'd love to hear your opinion on this, as well as your stories (in her shoes or mine) and some advice to stop being obsessive, in the hope that i'll learn from this. 

I sincerely thank you for taking the time to read this and read my story.

ae4hzj,1547018722.0,2019-01-09 07:25:22,offmychest,My Story,"I apologize for how long this might get, but I think it's time I shared it, even if nobody here knows me. Maybe this will be a good step into moving on.

Basically, for as long as I can remember, my parents always used to fight a lot. Throughout the years I heard threats, namecalling, screaming, crying. Things would get thrown, broken, etc. My mom once punched a hole in one of the paintings in the house. She also threw things in the kitchen, including a magnet I was really proud of making from some elementary school art class. My dad has thrown their mattress across the bedroom, broken lamps, slammed doors, etc. My mom seemed to always be more physical, but my dad was scarier. He definitely had more anger. Throughout my mid-teen years, divorce was thrown around nonstop, to the point I was so desensitized to it. In fact, over the years, I had become so desensitized to all the fighting in general, that I actually literally found a sense of comfort and familiarity in the fighting. It was all I knew for so long. 

Freshman year of high school, we had just moved to another district, so I knew nobody at my school. I felt so isolated and terrified. At the time I was dating one guy I had known in middle school. He was my first ""real"" boyfriend, and because of this I was naive and did not know what a toxic relationship looked like. Part of this was that at the time, I still was under the impression that my parents' relationship was normal. My relationship with this guy was alright at first, not that I remember much. Then one day, while I was at my great grandpa's house, my whole world was basically changed.

When nobody was around, my great grandpa ushered me into the kitchen with him, where he touched me. I was deeply uncomfortable, and I locked myself in the bathroom and cried in confusion. I told myself it must have been the ripped jeans I was wearing; I victim blamed myself. I immediately told my boyfriend. He seemed sympathetic and told me we could meet up later that week at the park between our houses. 

I was so vulnerable. I started telling him everything when I realized he seemed bored. He led me down an obscure path leading to a ditch concealed by these huge trees. I was reluctant but didn't know how to refuse. He started kissing me and then started removing my clothes. I tried telling him to stop and telling him that I was uncomfortable. He responded with ""don't worry about it"", ""trust me"", ""it'll be okay"". I think you can piece together just what happened. He then began asking me to roleplay with him over text, which I told him I was uncomfortable with. I played along as unenthusiastically as I could. I was disgusted when I later learned that he was showing the messages to his friends, and worse, to his dad. It was around this time I started to think back to my childhood. It was like a film was lifted off my eyes, as I realize what had happened to me when I was little. Both cousins, one from my mom's side of the family and one from my dad's, did things to me for years. The one on my dad's side of my family would build pillow forts with me and hide from my Nana, and would call me tiger and liked when my shirt was off. The one from my mom's side of the family would wait until my grandma was asleep to sneak me upstairs. I don't remember what we did, but I do remember it being sexual, because that's where I learned that ""down there"" feels good. When my cousins were doing this to me, I must have been six or under. Thinking about how young I was, I realized at this point that the clothes I wear don't really affect sexual assault or rape.

Things got worse when he started telling me he was cutting himself. He would never let me see the cuts, but he would send me pictures of bloody rags being held over his arms. He told me he did this because of me. It was my fault. Then the worst night happened. I don't remember why, but he told me he was going to hang himself from his bedroom ceiling fan with a rope he had hidden in his room; because of me. It was the night before Easter, I was dying eggs with my family. Secretively I was texting him, trying to keep a calm face in front of my family while simultaneously trying to convince my boyfriend not to kill himself. He told me that I killed him, that I am [REDACTED_NAME] reason he will be dead. After hours of pleading and a lecture from my parents for being moody and rude to them, he told me he got off the stool. He sent me a picture of his neck all red and scratched up. Somewhere in that time of pleading I had locked myself in my room and called the town police. I didn't know his address, but I told them the neighborhood he lived in and his phone number. I hoped someone would show up to make sure he was okay. Nobody ever went to his house. By the end of the relationship, I felt so horrible, like I had to punish myself. I got the idea of cutting from his ""cuts"". When we broke up, I told him that I cut myself and he became very angry at me and sent me another picture of a red rag on his arm, telling me I did this to him. By this point I was skeptical; every time I had seen him in person, his arms were spotless.

Regardless, one night my parents were fighting horribly. Though desensitized to the fighting at this point, their fighting became more regularly about me. I hated myself. I wanted to punish myself. I cut for the first time. It was the most painless one. It disgusts me, looking back, how much comfort I found in the fighting. There were times where I would hear raised voices downstairs and my heart would pick up and I would hone in real close to see if they were fighting or just talking loudly. A jolt of excitement would rush through me when it was a fight. I would almost feel disappointed when it was not a fight. It's disgusting. 

High school was the hardest for me, I was an outcast, I was bullied sometimes. I feel fortunate that the bullying was not that bad. I hear stories of kids being bullied and I feel like crying. I had nothing so severe happen. However, I hated high school and I felt like I didn't belong anywhere. I was nearly failing so many classes that I barely graduated. However, I managed to pull off graduating a semester early, just because of how much I hated it. I used the opportunity to work full time over spring to save for college. At my job, I got more attention from guys than ever before. I was confused, and I did things I am [REDACTED_NAME] proud of. I didn't cheat, but I led on multiple guys before finally choosing one. One was so angry, however, that he threatened to hurt my new boyfriend and me, and threatened to shoot his own ""goddamn head off with a shotgun"", his words. I reported it to HR and quit as soon as I could. 

Finally, I will close this super long story with college. I just got through my first semester at college, and life is looking up. I have a lot of trauma constantly being shoved in my face. I get panic attacks often, thinking I see someone from my past. I struggle to trust people, so nobody I've met at school truly knows me or what I come from. I truly enjoy being someone different to them. I know I can't keep it up forever, but for now I don't think any of them need to know all that personal crap. I've started working with a therapist on campus, and am hopeful for ridding myself of anxiety and depression and trauma. In the meantime I've learned self defense and have been teaching myself confidence I haven't had for longer than I can remember. 

If you read all the way through this, I truly appreciate the time you've spent. It feels good for me to finally get it all out, once and for all. If you have a story to share, I would love to listen. Thank you",2
dfl5yi,1570645615.0,2019-10-09 18:26:55,offmychest,I'm a 20 years old male and this is my story.,"Hello there strangers,

This is my first time ever using reddit, i'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if this is where this text is supposed to go, if i'm [REDACTED_NAME] the wrong place i sincerely apologize.

I was thinking about my life and decided to try and put all my 20 years life on a text. I don't really know what i hope achieving with this, but here we go.

&#x200B;

*\~ I don't remember much from when i was younger than 6 years old so lets start from there. \~*

The earliest things i can recall are my parents getting a divorce, as a fact the biggest memory i have from when i was a kid is my parents arguing, and i remember being really scared of that situation. I did never know the reason and up to today did never bother asking, but i just recall the feeling of ""my dad no longer lives with me"". At first i would cry a lot every night when going to sleep, but eventually i understood that he wouldn't disapear from my life as i thought he would, and managed to accept the situation.

My father would go out with me and my older brother from time to time, but the problem is that he would always compare us. He would always look at me and say that my brother had a skill that i didn't have, or he was getting good at something that i wasn't and i was getting left behind. Some examples to what i just said are: My brother started skateboarding, so my father made me do the same without my will, my brother started studying english and could speak it before me (we are from a non-english speaking country) so my father would always tell me things like ""He can already speak two languages, how come you can only speak one? You will never be good in anything if you keep this way"", my brother also started kitesurfing later on, he also learnt how to play the guittar, in all those situations my father would compare me to my brother, saying i would never be good enought. The list goes on and on. My father would also just ignore anything i said, numerous times when i was telling a story or even answering a question he himself had made, he would just start talking to my brother about something else (this happens up to this day).

As a result of this situation with my father i just learnt to ignore him, i never really felt comfortable around him and up to today i don't. He also got another woman pregnant twice, now i got 2 little sisters. I had nothing against my father have relations with another person, but her family was the worst, they were fully toxic and would not treat me with respect, they would always say i was annoying and that it would be a relief if i was not around some times.

My father did never help my mother, and she raised me and my brother all alone with no financial help. My mother also had to take care of my grandparents that were sick at that time, so i really think that was a really bad moment for her and i don't blame her for doing anything written on this paragraph. As a kid i would always sleep with my mother and would always sleep hugging her, after some time she just told me she didn't want me hugging her anymore, now that i'm a bit older i do understand that this situation could be a bit annoying for her, but she did never had a conversation with me about that, she just straight up pushed me away one night and told me that i would not sleep with her anymore. I felt like my mother didn't like me and didn't want me around. Yes this is one situation only, but there were plenty other things that made me think as such, if i describe everything here the text would get really long, so i won't. I would also like to make the statement that in between those situations with my parents i can't remember them telling anything such as ""I love you"" and i did never learn to tell them that, up to this day i don't tell them i love them, and both of them have already complained about me not saying ""I love you"".

When i turned 12 my mother made me change schools. I really don't remember the reason but i was really emotionally attached with the school i had to leave, so i automatically started to hate the new school (even before classes began). I just got in my own bubble, didn't want to talk to anybody, i just wanted the class to end for me to go back home, eventually i made 3 friends, and that was it.

At that time i started watching a lot of anime and started playing some online games. i would literally get back from school, take a nap, turn the computer on and then spend all day long watching something or playing something. At one point that made my grades fall down a cliff and my mom started telling me everyday that i was worthless, that i would never be anything in my life. And let me tell you this: that wasn't a one time thing when she got mad, when i tell you she would *everyday* say how worthless i was **i really mean everyday.** At that moment i would always just hope time could go faster so it would be night already i would go to sleep and not have to interact with anybody. That was the first time i ever thought about killing myself, it wasn't a huge thought in my head, but it would think that if i'm [REDACTED_NAME] i don't got any problems right? I hid it from everyone an dealt the situation alone. I wouldn't talk to anybody, i didn't know how to talk to anyone. Even with those 3 friends i previously said i had, i didn't know how to reach out for help, all i would talk to them was about anime and stuff like that.

Other people in school didn't like me, and i don't fully blame them. I don't think being 100% immersed on anime and games is good for a teenager, up to today i don't really know how to express my thoughts to other people, and for a majority of time people missunderstand me, eventually 1 friend of mine moved out of town and the other two had a discussion because of a girl, one of them started dating the girl (that then made him stop hanging out with me) and the other one just stopped talking to everyone, i was alone once again (that happaned when i was like 15). Just for an extra specification the schedule of my vacations were always as follows: i would wake up around 11am, use the computer till around 2am and then go to bed.

Life goes on and you know, at that point i was used to not knowing how to talk to people and being alone, so i didn't really care about that and just kept living.

I used to go to a local anime convention and somehow when i was 16 i met my first ever ""girlfriend"" on this convention (lets put that word in between quotation marks because i did only see her 3 times and she broke up with me by facebook). It was a strange thing, and yes, i did formally get on knee and asked her to date me, thats why i call her first ever girlfriend. When i got to school and people heard i had a girlfriend everyone told me ""You got a girlfriend because she hasn't had the time to acctually know you"". We saw each other 3 times in the time course of 1 month and as said before she broke up with me, which made me feel like people in my school were right, no one would ever date me.

At that point i had never felt so bad: from when i was a kid i did not believe i could find love inside my family, and then i just realized that it would also never happen outside it.

Two dudes from my class started talking to me after they knew my relationship was over, they would tell me to go to the gym and work out as much as i could, so i did. Coincidentally one of them lived really close to me, so i joined his gym, he would work out with me and boy let me tell you what: that was the first ever time in my life i had a purpose, i would think all day long that i wanted to go to the gym. At first i couldn't do a single push up, and after a couple of months i could do like [REDACTED_ADDRESS]arted noticing some visual changes in my body, boy did it feel good. (Just for the record, at that time i was like 68kg \~ 150lbs) But then the gym shutted down, and as i didn't know any other gym and had to do the college entrance test i just 100% stopped working out and focused on studying.

I started my bachelor's degree in physics in 2017, and boy things couldn't go any worse for me. I met around 5 guys that were in my class, and you know they were pretty nice folks, for like the first time ever i didn't have problems on talking to other people.

Remember that first ever ""girlfriend""? I was thinking about her and i was like ""Dude, i barely knew that girl and asked her out to start a relationship with me, if i'm [REDACTED_NAME] gonna do that again it will be to someone that i acctually know"". I met a girl at college, we were ""good"" friends. Let me explain the quotation marks: I used to do everything for that girl, i used to buy things for her, make her laught at all time, i would even search up new jokes on the internet to make her intertained all time, i would take her to everywhere she wanted to go and the list goes on. No i wasn't her friend, i was her puppy, but was too blind to notice it.

In february 2018 for the second time in my life i got on knee and asked a girl to become my girlfriend, she said yes.

The first month of relationship was really good, it felt great and i was happy, however, the next 7 months were hell. This girl started telling me how i had to get dressed, she told me i would always have to speak politely even between friends otherwise she would break up with me (today i can't believe that b\*ch told me she did never wanna hear me say a ""f\*\*k"" even when speaking with a friend) she lied to me, her mother lied to me, she made complete psychological terror out of our relationship and the list goes on, but i kept there because i didn't think i would find love any other place. Joke is on me, that wasn't love that was just she abusing me.

I tried to break up with her many times, and she would always do something against it. One time she just jumped into me and hugged me with all her strength and i remember she said ""No, this is not happening, this is not what's the best for me and we are not breaking up"" i didn't know what to do, i didn't know what to feel, and i didn't break up with her that day. Today i look back and think like, what about me? did she ever consider what was best for me?

She and her sister started convincing me that there wasn't anything wrong with our relationship, but that there was something wrong with me. They made an appointment at a psychiatrist that was a friend of them, my then girlfriend took me there, and the psychiatrist prescribed me some meds. I took the meds for like 2 months, i felt like garbage everyday all day long, but i really thought that i was the problem, therefore i had to take them. That was the second time i considered killing myself, i couldn't understand what to feel and i couldn't understand what was happening. No one in my family knows about this, i did never tell them.

In november 2018 i finally broke up with her, this time i didn't try it personally because i was afraid she would do something again, i just gave her a call and broke up with her, at that time i also stopped taking the meds.

A month later she would be telling me that she loved me and wanted to get our relationship back, but she would also explicitly tell me i had to change. That happaned for like 2 weeks, i got enought out of it and told her to f\*\*k off. She then wen't to the physics department administration and told them i was harasing her. Her parents came over to talk to the administration. As a result i couldn't go to classes for a whole semester. I didn't tell my mom that, i would just leave my house at the morning and come back at the afternoon so she thought i was taking classes.

After breaking up with her i also joined the gym once again, but unlikely the first time, i'm [REDACTED_NAME] seeing any results. My weight is not dropping (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] at 80kg \~ 176 lbs), i can't do push ups, i don't feel good as i felt back in 2016, and i'm [REDACTED_NAME] out for more than 8 months.

My now ex-girlfriend admitted to me she lied and took advantage of me, but still people stand by her side, for those people i just straight up cut contact with them, and now i'm [REDACTED_NAME] much alone again. I see her everyday on college, and now that i went through all that situation i can see when she's faking her empathy towards other people, and that makes me sick. I feel nothing but hatred for that girl, she mentally abused me for months, and took all the friendships i had made. It's been almost a year and i still feel so tired of it i can't even wonder how to talk to someone knew, i don't know if i'll ever trust someone else, i no longer feel pleasure on doing anything in my life.

Everytime she walks and sees me she puts on an expression that makes me sick, she looks at me like i don't have any reasons for hating her and with a bit of fear, she then ignores me and changes directions. Thats definetly on purpose to make me angry, i know that.

So we get to last week, where i f\*\*ed up once again. I was heading to my class and she was on the hallway, she saw me and started doing that stupid look, please be aware that when i left home i had a problem with my brother and was a bit stressed out, i was also going to a test, so i was a bit nervous. When i got past her i put my left hand on her shoulder and pushed her a bit, i didn't do it with the purpose of hurting her, i didn't put any strength on it, that was just as an act of putting all my feelings away.

I just got a call from the department administration, i don't know exactly what is going to happen, but i'm [REDACTED_NAME] deep sh\*t at the moment. Tomorrow i'll have a meeting with like 7 professors, i don't know what is going to happen, but they had warned me that the second time someone reported me for harassment i would have some problems. I might be a bad person, but i never intented to be one.

Thats my story, i'm a 20 years old male, physics student that never had any luck in life when it comes to relationships. I no longer feel joy on watching anime or playing games, i got no friends, i feel uncomfortable around anybody, i don't know how to say ""i love you"" to my family, i don't even know if i acctually love them. I seek some affection, but at the same time i don't want to be around anyone, because i know how hurtfull it can be.",6
bp8cuq,1557981596.0,2019-05-16 04:39:56,offmychest,Abused by my adoptive mother. Telling my story feels healing," First time I'm [REDACTED_NAME] out this story and I feel like it'd be great to finally get off my chest.
I was adopted through Bethany Christian Services in Pennsylvania. I was 13. Prior to being adopted I was told I'd be lucky if I found anyone to adopt me at my age. I was told I'd get to visit different families and if I liked them we'd move forward. If I didn't I could say so. Being afraid that the first one to come along would possibly the ONLY family to come along, I told the social workers they seemed nice. I mean they did at first, but I distinctly remember finding it odd that they seemed to ignore everything I said. They seemed to completely shut me out like everything I said had no meaning or value to them. That was the first red flag. We went on a couple outings to get to know each other and I found it odd that they wouldn't spend a dime. I didn't expect it, but lunch would come and go on those visits and they wouldn't ask if I ate nor bother to buy lunch before returning me to the agency and my foster parents. I kept it to myself thinking they must just have forgotten. 

Let me give you a bit of an idea what I was like as a kid so you've got some context:
I am [REDACTED_NAME] and didn't know it till adulthood. I'd have hours long screaming and crying fits. During these I didn't break things or hurt other people or need to be restrained but boy, I was LOUD. I am [REDACTED_NAME] sensitive as sensitive gets. I felt it was my only way to have any control. I remember often crying begging her to ""just be nice to me."" I remember feeling like I couldn't do anything to change my situation there because even when I behaved she was awful to me and would find an issue. I feel like I was just acting out because I felt hopeless. 

So, my parents go through with the adoption. I lived in their home a few months prior to the legal date. At first Mom and Dad seemed to be impressed by my work ethic. For example, I'd do a large project they'd told me they'd been meaning to do on the yard while they were away running errands. I wanted to show I could be useful and like any adopted kid, I was hoping by doing these things they'd keep me. Prior to this I'd had a family visit with me when I was 10 and got my hopes up before refusing to adopt me. Why? Because I often lied about doing my homework. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] kidding. I wish I was. I felt like a car on a lot that didn't do well enough to pass a test drive. 

Ok now weird shit starts happening. Mom starts giving me projects around the house and yard to complete whenever I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in school. Fair enough, until I realize outside of church I'm [REDACTED_NAME] allowed to hang with kids my age. Mom would taunt me about being socially ""behind"" yet constantly would not allow me to go to our youth group events that would be away overnight. I wasn't allowed to go to school field trips. I wasn't allowed to go to friend's houses. I wasn't allowed to their birthday parties. Nothing. Anytime I wasn't in school I was weeding, cleaning our blinds with a toothbrush, chopping down trees and cutting them into firewood, scrubbing our toilets, picking weeds out of the cracks in the driveway, and any other mundane task you can think of.  My parents were also health nuts that believed in detox, eating only organic food, not taking prescription medicine, and only taking homeopathic medicine. As soon as I was legally adopted they took me off all the meds I was on. Dumped them down the toilet, and I recall going through terrible withdrawals for about a week and a half. They were also religious, so anything healthy living couldn't cure...prayer certainly would. I SHOULD have been on medicine and attending therapy but instead my mom was trying to diagnose me from things she read on the computer. She came to the conclusion that I had RAD and was ""unable to attach."" Weirdly she never acted maternal towards me. So I think her RAD idea became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Aside from feeding me and making sure I stayed alive, she was my drill sgt. My father was a kind and patient man, but very quiet. Mom wore the pants and he didn't seem to mind. 

It started to become clear that mom had to control everything. Shortly after adoption she started to say weird things to me like, ""I never wanted to adopt a child but your father felt like God was calling us to do it so I went along with it like a good submissive wife."" I wasn't allowed to take food in our home or have seconds. She controlled my portions and I was often hungry. The work she'd have me doing all day easily burned 600+ calories but looking back...I'd say I ate maybe 600 everyday. I often remember lying on my bedroom floor holding my stomach bawling that I was hungry. She'd use locks on the cupboards when she'd go away and bike lock the fridge to the cabinet next to it. Now I've got an eating disorder and weird relationship with food, go figure. 
My clothing was picked and bought for me at Goodwill. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with thrifty clothing but Mom never cared about my personal style nor asked. I was constantly teased and bullied at school for my clothes and other things, so Mom pulled me out to homeschool me. That was a year from Hell. The only thing worse than being bullied at school was more time with her. Anytime she would be mad at me or I didn't respond to something the way she liked she'd body tackle me to the floor, make me lay with my hands stretched far above my head, and cover my mouth with her hand with it wedged up under my nose so I couldn't breathe. She'd scream and spit would fly into my face and she'd swear at me and call me nasty things. I should mention she'd been doing this to punish me when my Dad was at work since the first few months I lived there. It got more frequent when she homeschooled me. She'd do this if I wasn't understanding a math problem as quick as she felt I should, (I suck at math) and she'd do it if she ""didn't like my tone."" It frightened me because I figured she'd suffocate me one of these times. I could beg, cry, say she was going to kill me, it didn't matter. When I was in public school she'd make me stay home if she'd busted my lip or blackened my eye. Sometimes she'd slap me so hard it'd spin me around, and sometimes she'd make me stand with my head against a door while she screamed awful insulting things at me for an hour +. So finally after that year, I suggest a nearby Christian private school that I heard was nice. Didn't seem like much bullying went on there. I'd heard about it through our church. So luckily, they send me there. I liked that school. Problem was it was small and didn't serve lunches so Mom had to pack mine and she'd have other kids spy on me for her to be sure I never ate anything other than what she sent with me. If the principal offered candy to the winner for a contest or a gym event and I won, I couldn't have it or I'd get in trouble. At home I was made to take a laxative every morning and drink half a gallon of water (I had an assigned glass jug) before 5pm or no dinner. All sorts of weird food rules. By this time in their home I'm [REDACTED_NAME], exhausted from all the house and yard work that she'd have me do till the moon was out, and I was contemplating suicide often. After awhile my Dad starts to catch on to what she's been up to with me. He starts trying to talk to me, ask me what's going on and comfort me discreetly. However, at one point she gets paranoid and listens in at my bedroom door without us knowing, KICKS IT IN, and screams at us for talking about her. She proceeds to grab me by my shirt and drag me down the stairs and doesn't give me a chance to stand up. He asks her to stop and an argument between them ensues while I run up to my room to hide. Mom started to tie me to a chair after that during summer break from school when dad wasn't home. She'd stand behind me and scream into my ear asking me what ""lies"" I'd told my father. I often just shook and cried and didn't respond so she'd kick the chair over with me in it, pinning one of my arms to the floor beneath. 
After this Mom finally drags me to a couple different counselors but when they suggest there's anything she could do differently parenting-wise she gets angry and marches us out. She wanted them to tell me I was terrible and what I could do differently. We never go back. The abuse keeps getting worse so my Dad gets my Mom to agree to send me to a nonprofit boarding school when I'm 17. Honestly, even though it ended up being a cult and that's a whole other story, it was great to not have someone controlling every single thing I did without giving me a say.  
After that, my life slowly got significantly better. Mom and I had a couple more run-ins after that making me realize she was so toxic I couldn't have a relationship with her. I shake involuntarily anytime she's near. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of her to this day. I basically can't talk to my Dad without her intercepting any communication. I tried so hard to be good in their home, to please her, to be a part of the family but it felt like she saw me as some sort of live-in servant. 
Getting therapy and medicine for my depression and anxiety now so ...cheers to the road towards healing. ✌

TL;DR My adoption was a nightmare and I regret going with the first family I met :(",2
a0fiui,1543202367.0,2018-11-26 03:19:27,offmychest,"When I was a child, I was molested by my older brother","     
A quick note before I begin, at the time of this I (M) was around 7-9 with my brother being 14-16. I vaulted this away in my memories as a child I assume, because I completely forgot about this until a month ago and completely broke down when I remembered. Anyways onto the story.

   
I grew up in an upper middle class family family, with a seemingly perfect life. My parents were happy, my older brother the over acheiver of the family, me the quiet middle child, and my little brother the baby of the family. Everything was fine until one day when we went grocery shopping. My mother was okay leaving us inside of the car when she went shopping as long as my older brother was there and the doors were locked. Well when we parked and she went in, she took my younger brother with her, leaving me and my brother behind. 

     
This was perfectly normal and it was like that for around 5 minutes, until my brother asked to play truth or dare. Being 7 I didn't see a problem playing,  in fact I was ecstatic because we never did anything together. We messed around saying and doing random things until he finally dared me- Pull down your pants and underwear. I remember thinking that was weird, but did it anyway. (I had literally 0 exposure to sex at this point and had no idea of anything past kissing) So the game went back to normal with us messing around again until, yet again, I chose dare. He dared me to let him suck it. At this point I was COMPLETELY confused, but I let him do it anyway because I did not want to anger him. The for the next 10 minutes I remember him having me look out the car window to see if my mother was coming back and warn him when she did. 

    
 
Life went back to normal after that for about a week. Until one night I woke up to my brother coming into my room telling me to come with him. He lead me into the computer room (all of my family's computers where there) and pulled up the internet. He started a lesbian porn video and told me to watch. He showed me his penis and started to play with it while urging me to do the same to mine. This lasted for about an hour before we went back to bed. We ended up doing this once a week and even developed a safety system incase our parents woke up where I would hide and he would pretend to be getting water since the kitchen was near. 

     
For the last 3 months of this he started leading me to his bedroom and told me to hide opposite from his bed if my parents came in. He started having me suck him while he occasionaly did the same to me. I don't know why but I can still vividly remember the taste and smell of having to do that. He had me do it about 3 times a week for around an hour each time.

   
 Thankfully, after a while everything stopped. Which makes sense since that is around the time he got his first girlfriend. Fast forward 8 years and he is now married with a baby girl. He still comes to our house frequently over the weekend alone since he works away from his family. I hate him. I've hated him for a while but had no idea why until I remembered this. 

     
I have no idea what caused these memories to come flooding back to me. I was staying up late watching television with my friend and it hit me. Randomly I, a 17 year old guy, broke down sobbing into a pillow infront of a friend. He comforted me but I couldn't bring myself to actually tell him what caused the breakdown. It has been bothering me ever since. My family would never believe me if I  came out with my story because it is about their favorite child where it would be my word vs. his, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] afraid of telling my friends about it living in an area where people hate anything gay. Honestly, remembering this has started making me realize things about myself that I didn't really notice before.

I felt like telling anyone about this may help me move past it, so thank you to anyone who read this massive wall of text. Also, sorry if the formatting is weird, I am [REDACTED_NAME] this in the middle of the night on my phone. 

Edit: I feel like I should include, we never went past oral. I think at the time he was too scared and I couldn't get an erection.",2
bu7zqr,1559090473.0,2019-05-29 00:41:13,offmychest,15F Is this sexual abuse? My story.,"When I was 9 I had a friend that I would go to church(awana) with he was 12 and his family were family friends. 

I would go over his house all the time after school or church and we would just hangout and watch his brothers... sometimes. 

It all started as him showing me prom videos that I didn’t really understand or care about then it progressed to him forcing me to sit on his lap while he touched me under my underwear while watching henti. And that’s how things between me and him where. Him touching me and showing me porn. Once he told his friend about how cool it was to dry hump me(I didn’t know that’s what it was at the time) this wasn’t very forced though. I did say no but eventually gave in. And they did that for maybe 30 minutes. I remember the only reason it stopped was because my grandpa came to look for me at there house. He saw me in the position and said nothing. 

Eventually the boy moved and we lost communication 
 (End of the story with him) 
..................................................................

After I had experienced things with him someone on Omegle told me about “body swapping” to this day I do not know what his true intention was. He gave me the account information of this girl I’ll call Hailey and gave me some picture of her and nudes of her. He told me to communicate with people in her life and basically live as this girl. He told me to send pictures of myself so he could see from my “POV” so I did. I asked him if I was supposed to wear clothes and he said no. As this girl I talked to a lot of guys and shared her nudes with them whenever they’d ask. Once I ran out of pics to send them I asked the guy what to do and he said I could say no. And that was the FIRST time I realized that I could say no to things. So I said no to the guy that thought I was Hailey. 
(I’m sooo sorry Hailey) 

..................................................................
(Still 9 or 10) 


I had kik and I would go on a extension of the sight where you could find people to talk to I met MANY MANY guys and they all wanted nudes so I sent them. I also had Omegle and I repeated the same process. If I did not send pictures id hate myself. 

Everntually I started saying no to sending pictures a lot and the men would guilt trip me into doing this I thought that if I didn’t send photos these men would kill themseleves 
But then it progressed to something more. 
Men would ask for pictures and If I didn’t send them I’d seee demons all over my room screaming at me for being a horrible person. 

sending nudes to men stopped for me when I was almost 11 because my sister found a nude on my iPad and took it away.(thankfully)


(I’d like to clarify the reason I sent pics in the first place is because I thought I had no other option) 


....................................................................

Like I said before i felt like I had to send nudes to men but at that age I felt like I had to do a lot of things like: cut my tongue off or break my bones. 
( I tried to break my bones many times by throwing myself off play structure) 
I believe I met have had some type of childhood ocd that I don’t have any more. 

Although. My ex boyfriend who has severe  ocd thinks I do because of some of the things I do now but I highly doubt it. But I am a perfectionist. 

.............,..................................................... 
 
At age 12 I started self harming heavily I self harmed everyday and I’d cry everyday before school because I was terrified of stepping into the building. Sometimes I couldn’t even leave my house out of fear that someone would kill me. I had severe anxiety (at the time I thought I may have anxiety and talked to my grandma about this and she said I was to young to have anxiety and I agreed with her) but now I know that i definitely did. 

I became homeschooled because going to school was way to hard and I stayed homeschooled until the last semester of 7th grade. 

In 8th grade I never ate lunch although I would buy it every single day I just never wanted to eat. 
In the summer before 9th grade I joined the varsity  cheer team and got a concussion during cheer camp (I’m a flyer and fell out of a stunt)(extra background info I started cheering when I was 8) a week after cheer camp I tried to kill myself and was sent to a psych ward for a month

While I was in the psych ward I didn’t eat for 2 weeks so they started making me drink boost because I lost A LOT of weight. Whenever I’d have boost I’d get the urge to purge. (I had tried to back in 8th grade but couldn’t) then I started feeling like I absolutely had to purge so I did i don’t have much of a gag reflux so I’d have to keep my hands in my mouth for about 30 seconds moving then around and stabbing this tongue like thing in the back of my throat. 

At this point I purged everytime I had a boost and they found out and I was diagnosed with bulimia and about a week later they change my diagnosis to anorexia nervosa due to how underweight I was. Whenever I’d eat I’d find something to cut myself with and one time I was so upset I cut myself 101 times because that was my highest weight (I was using blunt plastic objects) 

After a month in the psych ward they send me home because my insurance gave out 5 days later I tried to kms again and got sent to a different psych ward for a month but that month was interrupted due to the fact I refused to eat and was sent to get force fed threw a tube. Once I went back to the psych ward I got send to a residential treatment. After I got out I was sent to partial hospitalization for 2 months and met some amazing people while restoring weight. 

Now I’m about to finsh freshman year with a trash gpa and I’m ready to share my story with the internet (still refuse to tell my therapist) 

Anyway I want opinions on my sexual childhood and how to deal with it. I also want to find someone that can relate to me.",2
1ah075h,1706867822.0,2024-02-02 09:57:02,offmychest,Me and my straight best friend fell in love and were in a secret 'relationship' for years.,"Hi guys, this is my story about how me and my straight best friend fell in love, and how I'm [REDACTED_NAME] struggling with it right now. I can’t really find anything on reddit with the same bizarre situation I found myself in. This all occurred between 2[REDACTED_PHONE]. This is a long story, so strap in.For some context - I'm a (closeted) bi 26 male, my friend is a straight 28 male. Both of us are middle eastern men and have traditional middle eastern families where it is expected to get married to a woman (will become relevant). We are stereotypical middle eastern men, both around 6-foot, beard, muscles.  
  
I met my friend, James, in the gym in August of 2016. I was 19, he was 21. We would train every day at the exact same times and would notice each other but not talk at all, just the occasional 'bro nod' if we made eye contact. I thought he was handsome, he was buff and had a cute smile, but no intention to get romantic or intimate with him. There was always some weird tension in the air that each one of us wanted to talk to one another, but no one made the first move. Then one day at the gym while I was training legs, I noticed him doing deadlifts. The deadlift platforms are right next to the squat racks, so we were just a few metres away from each other. He was struggling to remove the weights from the bar, so I went and offered some help. From that moment we started talking and just instantly clicked. We set up some training days, which would then lead into us going to get post workout meals and going out together and eventually becoming best friends pretty fast. And that's all it was at first - two bros that met in the gym and became best friends.James was a cool, fun, caring, considerate, innocent guy. He didn't have any friends really. He left school at 15 or 16, fell out of contact with his school friends and just would spend his time in the gym or gaming. His family situation at home was not what you'd call ordinary, but I wouldn't t want to share those details. I learned that he was quite the trouble maker in his late teens - getting into fights, getting arrested etc. James was a hot head and that never changed throughout the years. After his teens, he started the gym and just focusing on bettering himself. It's something that I really admired of him. As a result of him working on himself, he didn't socialize with people much, didn't go out at all, heck, he didn't even know there was such things as different types of coffees! (cappuccino, latte's etc.) Regardless, he had a heart of gold. He would randomly message me ""Good morning bro, have a great day"" or message me throughout the day hoping my day is going well. It was great having a friend like him.As time went on, we grew closer, we practically spent every day together, whether it be at the gym, or at each other’s houses, family BBQ's, beaches, restaurants, partying - you name it. We became inseparable, honestly felt like a brother. We would talk for hours about our what we wanted in the future, our love for cars, gaming, foods etc. A couple months after first talking, it was his birthday. I love getting presents for my friends, so I surprised him with a gaming headset and a tub of creatine. His reaction was priceless, seeing him so happy was just great. It’s important to note, up until now, all feelings were just brotherly love, there were no romantic feelings.  
  
In December of 2016, I met a guy that I would eventually date. This was my first boyfriend, so it was quite exciting, having had many girlfriends before it just felt like a different thrill. We dated for about 6 months, but in this time, me and James drifted a little. I couldn't find the time to catch up as much, and I was now training with my boyfriend instead. James thought my boyfriend was just another friend, and I'd still see James at the gym regularly and speak to him quite often, but it wasn't the same as before. Eventually me and my boyfriend broke up in May of 2017. Me and James started hanging out more after this.I was struggling after the break up with my boyfriend (he cheated on me), and being closeted, had no one I could talk to. I felt James knew something was up, but never really questioned anything. Eventually, I felt like I just needed to tell someone, and James was the only person I felt like I could trust. I picked him up to go for a drive (we usually would just enjoy going for drives, listening to music and just talking). We parked at a lookout spot that we would usually chill at, and we started talking then I just started crying. I told him I needed to tell him something, and that I hope he didn't see me any different or feel any different about me (this was my biggest fear, being abandoned for something I had no control over i.e. my sexuality). He just kept telling me to tell him, that its fine that he's not going to judge. So I eventually told him that my ""friend"" that he saw me training with at the gym, wasn't just a friend, he was more than that. His response, which I will never forget, was ""so he was your best friend?"". This made me burst out laughing because he wasn't trying to be funny, he genuinely couldn't pick up on what I was trying to insinuate. I told him no, he was my boyfriend, and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. He just looked at me and told met that's fine, and that it doesn't change how he thinks of me or anything. He hugged me and told me it’s going to be ok.  
  
Me and James started training together again, would spend each weekend together, and basically did everything together, again. This time, it felt as if we were much closer. I could feel myself getting feelings for him, both emotionally and sexually. Since coming out to him, he made me feel safe and accepted. I now found him really attractive, and at times he'd catch me staring at him or giving him shy looks. I sometimes got the vibe that maybe he liked me back, but I would always try to downplay the feelings because I genuinely didn't want to ruin our friendship. Plus, he was completely straight, and I knew there was no chance he would go for anything - or so I thought.James had gotten his arm sleeve tattooed - and being a fresh tattoo, his arms were much more sensitive. He would randomly tell me to run my fingers along his arms because it felt really good - which I used to love doing, and to be honest, just made me want him really bad. However one night, James was staying the night (he usually would stay over on the odd weekend). My family was out of town on vacation, and it was just me and James. He was laying down on my bed and we were just talking, then he asked me to run my fingers along his arm. I was sweating after a couple of minutes. Eventually, I started running my finger up his arm, along his shoulder and down his body. He didn't say anything or move, he just had his eyes closed. One thing led to another, and I ended up pulling his pants off and giving him a blowjob. He had his eyes closed and would randomly say that the cant believe this is happening and that he's not into guys but he doesn't know what's going on. We spent all night kissing and fooling around. The next day, things were normal between us, we talked about what happened, about how he's not gay but he enjoyed it, and it became sort of frequent. At this stage, our relationship was more sexual rather than emotional (albeit there was still strong emotion there) - we were both still talking to other people. I would see the odd guy for a hookup, but it just felt off, so I stopped seeing or talking to people all together. James also expressed that it did hurt him that I was seeing other guys. James continued to speak to and see other girls, which did hurt me a lot, but I wasn't ever in a position to tell him he had to stop. I knew he was a straight guy that had urges, which didn't make it any easier to deal with. Every time James would go out and see a girl, he would tell me how wrong it felt and that he didn't want to hurt me. Honestly, it broke me more and more each time. This is what began the cycle of the most intense, profound happiness, and the most heartbreaking of pain.  
  
So fast forward a few months (late 2017), the feelings became more emotional and intense. Even though he was still randomly seeing women (once every few months), I couldn't stop loving him. I didn't know how to stop. We would hold hands when no one was looking, kiss secretly, we stopped talking to other people. We basically were in an unofficial relationship. It felt amazing but in the back of my mind, I felt like crap. I saw that James had days where he struggled, he questioned if he was gay or bi, he would try to explore (gay porn, looking at other guys) but he couldn't figure out why he felt the way he did for me, and I could see it really bothered him. Eventually we came across pansexuality, and once he learned about it, he thought that he may be Pan. This brought him some closure, but it never felt like it would last forever.You could say we 'unofficially' dated after late 2017. We both didn't talk to others for a few months, and it was just us two together. We would go on dates, mini vacations and get aways, sleep at each other’s houses (our families still thought we were just friends), still trained together, and honestly life in those months felt perfect. He felt like he was the perfect guy for me. We told each other we loved each other frequently and would talk about how we want to spend the rest of our life with each other. I thought I was in love in my previous relationships, but this was far and above any of those. The feelings were so intense both ways. I was always the more dominant one in all my previous relationships, but with James, he made me feel safe, that he could take care of me, he would give me butterflies just by seeing him. I was madly in love with him and he too with me. It was almost perfect, but we both struggled. We both knew deep down that this would never really work out.  
  
There was always the pressure from family, especially for me, to get married to a woman and have kids. I struggled because I felt like I had to try and pursue someone, just to keep my family happy and remove any suspicion of me being gay/bi (sounds stupid, I know). Eventually mid 2018 an old female friend from school came into my life again, and she had told me how she always had feelings for me. I tried for a month or so to talk to her (James knew), but it never worked out. I was talking to her, whilst being in love with James, it was beyond selfish on my part, and it was just a disaster waiting to happen and well that disaster did happen, on my 21st birthday.On my 21st birthday, mid 2018, I hired a hotel room, and my female friend came. I had a ton of other friends there, along with James. I guess to put up the charade of me being straight to the rest of my friends, I was kissing and around my female friend all night. The female friend slept in the same bed as me, and we ended up having sex. While we were doing it, James walked in and yeh... it ended up really messy. It was probably my biggest regret I've had until this day. I knew I shouldn't. In that moment I was scared if she would suspect I was Bi or gay and out me to my friends, especially since she would already question mine and James' relationship. Eventually after a couple of weeks, I told my female friend it’s not going to work out, and just focused on fixing things with James. I had really hurt him and honestly felt like absolute crap. I knew he loved me, and I still chose to sleep with her, and then for him to walk in and see that, it just makes me sick knowing I caused him that pain. This female would also be the last person I would see intimately until January of 2024. We eventually moved past this, and things more or less went back to how they were, where me and James were just doing life together.For the next couple of years (2[REDACTED_PHONE]), things were mostly good. We would be okay for months on end, where we both acted oblivious to the future and knowing we would probably never work out, but we were both in love and enjoying life, enjoying the moment. Then James would go through the same struggles with our situation where he began questioning himself again, he didn't feel 'normal' (his words), and in turn, would go out and see other girls. We were both not in positions to come out or let anyone know about us. Eventually there was a night that we argued, and he stopped answering all calls and texts. Turns out he went and had met up with a woman and slept with her. This broke me, much harder than previous times. We didn't talk for a few days, but as the toxic cycle goes, he contacted me after a couple of days, and I caved. I still loved and cared for him dearly.When we did begin talking after a few days, he kept saying he's sorry, that he was just craving a woman's body, that his head is all messed up and he's struggling because he's in love with me, a man, but is straight. I really understood his struggles, and I know how much he was giving up for me (a straight, attractive 24-25 year old, choosing to spend his time with me instead of women). I loved him so much; I knew that this was a big struggle for him. I tried to end things multiple times just so it stops playing with his head so much, but every time one of us would go back to the other. In hindsight, I don't know why each of us kept going back, especially since we both knew it would never work between us. All we would both ever say is that we wish things were different (i.e. different family situations, I was a female etc.).From mid-2018, I hadn't seen anyone else, and James continued to see women once every 3-6 months, the last being mid-2021. We would constantly fight about this, but not being in an actual relationship, it just felt impossible to tell not to. He begged to have a threesome when he had urges to see a woman, and at first I wanted to, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt as if it would hurt too much to see him with a woman. I never told him he couldn't see other woman, but he made it very clear that if I saw another man and had sex with another man, that would be the end of us. James was ok if I were to occasionally see women, but to see another man was completely off limits. Sounds ridiculous, I know.This cycle continued for the following years (2[REDACTED_PHONE]). It was disgustingly toxic and yet, when blocking out all the trauma, was the most amazing time together. We both knew this would never work, we both knew neither could stop each other from moving on to other people, yet neither one of us wanted to end things. Me and James were in love. We became part of each other’s families, we went to each other’s family weddings, family events, went on vacations. We made love, we spoke about our fantasy future with one another, we spoke about how we want to grow old together. We went and bought one of his dream cars together, we helped each other start our own businesses, he made me feel safe, cared about, valued, like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only man in this world. He made me feel what true love feels like. He would wish me a good morning or good night every day, just as he did when we first met as friends. He would tell me he loved me every day, and I too him. I wanted to give him the world. We spoke every single day; we told each other we loved each other every day and every day we wished things were different.  
  
In May of 2022, everything would change. We had planned to spend a Friday night at my place, with some pizza and watch movies/sport. When James was picking up the pizza in his aforementioned dream car, he popped a tyre. He came to mine; my dad woke up from his sleep and fixed it. However, you can imagine, a grumpy middle eastern dad just woken up from his sleep, and a hot headed 26-year-old does not make for a good mix. After my dad fixed the tyre and went inside, I told him that he needed to relax and show some respect, which made James flip out. he left the pizza, got in the car and drove off. We didn't speak until that Monday. I called him on the Monday, and he seemed off. He was saying things like we really shouldn't speak anymore and to just forget about him. I kept pressing and asked if he had slept with anyone. He said he did, which of course then had that usual feel of heart break that I was slowly becoming numb to, but then he still seemed really off. I kept pressing and asked who. He didn't want to tell me, he kept putting it off, kept telling me to hang up and forget about him. I felt myself getting sick, and I begged him to please tell me. He then said, ""your aunty"". My heart sank. I fell silent and started quivering. I asked ""what? what did you say?"". He started apologizing and repeated ""your aunty"". I then started screaming, asking which aunt and what he was talking about. He then said her name. This was my aunty who was only a few years older than me and was basically an older sister to me. I burst out into tears and hung up. I was hyperventilating and felt like the walls were caving in. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't go outside of my room as my entire family were home, I couldn't make noise, I couldn't scream, shout, punch anything. It felt as if time had stopped and I couldn't hear, smell, taste or see anything. All I could feel is my throat clogging up and my eyes not being able to produce tears fast enough. I felt like I was in a corner, I ended up finding the phone number of an old guy I had met online, we hadn't spoken for over 5 years, and just called him and told him what was going on. Poor guy probably in a state of shock, but I seriously didn't know how to react to that. My best friend/lover sleeping with my aunt who is like an older sister to me. I became an absolute wreck. I immediately deleted James off social media and blocked his number and ended up leaving the house and driving to mine and James look out spot where I had come out to him, and stayed there all night. I cried myself to sleep in the car. I had never felt that type of pain before.  
  
Some more context - growing up in a middle eastern family, we are very close with one another. I would see my grandparents about 3 times a week and said aunt every 2nd day. Family is everything in our culture and something like this is just completely foreign to me. It hurt especially more because James was literally part of our family, even before things got intimate/romantic. There wouldn't be a family event run where my family didn't invite him. So this betrayal both felt like a betrayal of me and my family. It was also a betrayal from my aunt. It takes two to tango, so I knew that a lot of the blame fell on her also for going through with that situation. (Again, it might be ok for some people to have their friends hook up with their relatives, but in our culture and from what I have grown up with, it was completely foreign and absurd.)  
  
I ended up going no contact with James for the weeks that followed. My aunt also found out that I knew and initially apologized which quickly turned into a threat, saying that if anyone else found out in our family, I'd ""have to be the one to explain to her son why he's growing up without a mother"". To put it plainly, I was a complete wreck. I didn't know how to deal with the situation, I didn't know how to process it, I tried to block out emotions, deal with emotions, meditate, do something that was interesting, but it felt like nothing was working. I couldn't focus for the next 2 weeks at all, would find myself crying while driving. I couldn't eat at all, didn't respond to any of my other friends, didn't see family, couldn't train at the gym, nothing was enjoyable. It really was a dark and miserable time, and honestly, I don't know how I got through it. What was crazy though, was that I remember thinking that maybe it was my fault. Maybe that because he was in this situation with me, and that he felt so bad seeing women that he forced himself not to, that I drove him to the point of doing something like this. He hadn't seen a woman for about a year before this incident, so I feel like if I had maybe encouraged him to go and satisfy his urges, he wouldn't have slept with my aunt? (Side note - Wow, writing this now, and reflecting, it really shows how little I valued myself. I was willing to go through that pain of him sleeping with a woman, just so I can continue loving him and feeling loved?)  
  
James' sister contacted me within those 2 weeks, asking what's going on. James' sister was the one of the only people I liked in his family, she really cared and looked after James, and made me feel accepted into their family. She said she noticed James seemed off, and when she asked him, he just said that him and I had a fight and that he, (James), fucked up. I told her what happened, and she just said have your space and how messed up that situation is. We spoke for about 20 minutes, before hanging up. It was really hard to forget about James. My family would constantly ask about him, my grandparents would demand he come over, my siblings all missed him. It just sucked. Everything and everyone reminded me of him. It was just a really difficult time These two weeks were the longest I hadn't seen or spoken to him for about 5 years.After about 5 weeks in July of 2022, James started trying to contact me begging to see me. He called me off private numbers and his sister’s number. There was a weekend he tried to call over 100 times. In the end, being the weak miserable person I was at the time, I answered. He wanted to meet in person to talk and be able to say goodbye properly. He kept telling me how sorry he was, and how he didn't know what happened that night, he just asked my aunt to go for a drive and then they ended up meeting up in our lookout spot (yes, where I came out to him and where I cried all night!) and one thing led to another, and they had sex. He kept telling me it’s the biggest mistake of his life and that he loves me and he's sorry. Part of me just wanted to hug him (pathetic, I know), but in the end I just told him what a pig I thought he was and to just leave me alone. It’s weird, because at the time I seriously blamed both of them, but there was still a part of me that blamed myself for causing this entire situation. In hindsight, I remember my aunt being very touchy feely with him at family events, and James would always try and stay away from her (I always thought that's just because James is a sort of introvert and my aunt is very extrovert, so he wanted to get away from her).James in that same week came to my home. It was night time and he knocked on the door and refused to leave, begging to talk. I didn't want to make a scene at home, so I just put on some shoes and went with him. He spoke about how sorry he was, and asked how I was doing and basic small talk. I didn't really respond to him, just asking what the fuck he wanted and that I just want to be left alone. He kept apologizing, saying he doesn't know how to stay away and that he just gets nights like these where he tries his hardest not to contact me but can’t help it. I honestly can’t remember that night well, I just remember going to park somewhere and we just spoke, and he just wanted this opportunity to say goodbye properly. After a couple of hours, he dropped my off at home and that was that, or so I thought.  
  
I went no contact for a few months, until about November of 2022. I had started going to the gym with my friend, X. One day when driving him home from the gym, we were at a traffic light and James pulls up next to me in his car. He looks inside and then starts going crazy in the car. He pulls down his window and is screaming and making hand gestures for me to wind the window down. I just drive off and he proceeds to follow me. The drive back to my friend’s home is about 10 minutes, he follows me for about 6 minutes, the entire time speeding up and racing past me, then slowing down and waiting for me to catch up to him. We end up at another traffic light and my friend is now freaking out. James proceeds to scream and tells me to wind my window down, which I do now. He starts asking ""who's that?"" and ""are you already seeing another guy"". I then tell him to calm the fuck down, it’s just X. (James knows X, he just couldn't recognize him because it was night time and windows are tinted). He then clearly breathes a sigh of relief and then begs if we can just talk. I didn't want to freak my friend out anymore, so I told him to wait in the side street and I would come back. I dropped my poor friend off and ended up returning to the side street to speak to James.I got into his car and immediately I looked at him and he looked really bad. He looked like he hadn't been sleeping much, he had lost weight, he didn't have a clean haircut (we would go cut our hair together every week). I just asked him how he was, and he broke down crying. I couldn't help it and hugged him. He kept apologizing and saying it’s the biggest mistake of his life and because of his fuck up he had lost me. It’s one of the very few times I saw James cry. As fucked up as it sounds, I felt heartbreak for him. I gave him another hug and all I could smell was him. His smell. It drove me insane. I had missed him so much and just for a few minutes, time stood still and it felt like nothing mattered again. We ended up talking for a few minutes, and then out of no where we locked eyes and ended up kissing. In the moment I didn't realize how wrong this was, but I don't think I really ever accepted that I wanted to lose him? That kiss felt like the kiss we had on the first night, its really hard to put into words the feelings that were going on. I ended up suggesting to get a hotel room, which he went and booked and we ended up spending the night together. We kissed, made love, cuddled. It felt like nothing else mattered in that moment. It was the wrong thing to do, and should have never happened, but I wasn't strong enough to stop it. I don't know if I regret this, but I know it wasn't the right thing to do. I woke up the next morning and we went our separate ways. I remember feeling like trash while driving home, like what the hell did I just do? But then there was a part of me that enjoyed it, enjoyed him, enjoyed feeling cared for and safe in his arms. It was just a really confusing time.This I guess then led into us trying to talk again (Again, I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for this). Up until this moment, I had just been dealing with it alone, hadn't spoken to anyone, bar that guy I called the night I found out about the situation with James and my aunt. It was a really lonely time and maybe I should have seen a therapist, but I never really understood how that works or if it works at all. So I guess I just allowed James back into my life, and we became really close again. We weren't doing much intimate stuff together, but he was really trying with me. He would constantly tell me he loves me, he was being really affectionate and was trying hard, but for me, it just never really felt the same. I still loved him so much, and still struggled to imagine him with someone else or me without him, but it just didn't feel the same.From late 2022 until late 2023, we tried to make it work. He never came to my home or any family events after the incident in May of 2022, I went to his home a few times but felt like I shouldn't be there, especially with his sister knowing what happened. I ended up telling my friend, X, about the incident with my aunt. I didn't tell him the full story with James and I. It felt as if it was wrong for other people to see us talking again, even though to 99% of people, they just knew us as best friends/brothers. I felt pressure to try and keep me and James talking a secret. It was just a difficult period. Things just weren't the same, we knew the trauma was too much, but no one wanted to end things for good. I did eventually tell him I love him again. I did really love him, I don't think I ever stopped, but it just felt different. Even when he told me he loved me, it felt different. We tried to make it work but it never really clicked again.  
  
In 2023, I had booked a trip to travel overseas into from late 2023 into January of 2024. It had been my dream to travel, since my last trip in 2019 I had cut 2 weeks short for James (a completely separate side story). This trip would be with me and X. James hated the idea of me travelling, just because he was afraid I would meet another guy (his words, not mine). However I just didn't care anymore and booked the trip. About 2 months before the trip, me and James had a big fight. As like most others, it was because he was sick of feeling like he was not able to be with women. He kept saying that he is a straight guy and he feels bad to even talk to a woman, and he hates that. He kept saying he doesn't blame me, its himself, but he cant help it. In the end, I just told him to go do whatever made him happy, which I have always done, and to just leave me alone and just to go our separate ways. It was a longer conversation with that but I honestly cant remember the details, I just know I was so over the fighting.So for the first time, he did leave me alone, he didn't contact me for those months. We'd see each other at the gym every night (same gym as we first met in, poetic hey?), and just act like strangers. We constantly made eye contact, but we both knew we couldn't go back to one another. It felt really sad, but honestly I don't think I had accepted those feelings yet. He messaged me a couple days before I was meant to leave, wishing me a great trip and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] getting to fulfil one of my dreams of travelling. I honestly wanted to hug him after this but instead just replied ""Thanks"".I went on said trip, I was travelling throughout Europe for 2 months. I met a few guys, but I couldn't bring myself to do anything intimate with them. I finally understood what James meant when he said that it felt wrong to talk to someone else, even though you are attracted to them. It felt like I was betraying James. My loyalty for him was so embedded into my existence that I forgot how to interact with other people in an intimate/romantic setting. Overall, the trip was amazing and I had a great time, I just figured out pretty early on in the trip that I don't want to be meeting anyone, I don't think I was ready yet. (Side note - I was posting stories on my Instagram throughout my trip, and James would view every single one, even though we don't follow each other, so he was still actively checking my account)  
  
Fast forward to now, January of 2024. I arrived home a few weeks ago, and after a few days went to see my barber. This barber was one both me and James went to every single week (I introduced James to him). James would usually go on Wednesdays, so I made sure to go on Thursday to avoid him. However, as chance would have it, after sitting on the barber chair for about 5 minutes, I see James' vehicle pull into the parking lot. I instantly feel nervous, I felt heavy in my seat, and started sweating. Not sure what made me feel this way, but I couldn't help it. He walks in and is stunned, because just a few days ago I had posted a photo on my Instagram story of me in London, and I know he had seen it. He walks up to me in the barber chair, and shakes my hand and welcomes me back. He asked how my trip was, I respond ""great"", and then he went and took a seat on the couch. Throughout the entire haircut, we would catch each other staring at one another through the mirror.That week that followed, I couldn't really get him out of my head. I really wanted to see him and talk to him. I really missed him. So come the following Thursday, I was working and planning to get a haircut that day. I stopped by home to spray some cologne, and went to the barber shop. James wasn't there, but if he were to come it would be around 4-5pm, as he finished work around 3 to 3.30pm. So I sat, and after about 30 minutes, James walks in, only this time he doesn't say hi to me. He just goes and sits down on the couch. We made eye contact a few times, before I said to myself screw it, and messaged him ""stop looking so angry"" (James had a resting b\*\*\*\* face lol). He immediately burst into laughter lol, and couldn't contain his smile. I then signalled to him to come sit near me, so he did.  
  
We started talking, him asking about my trip, me asking how he has been, and we both knew we wanted to ask each other if we had met someone. He then looked at me and told me ""I know you want to ask something"" so I just did. I asked if he had a girlfriend now (in a joking way), I was really expecting him to say no, especially since our last argument, he made it clear he doesn't want a relationship or anything, however, he just looked at me and said yeh. He saw my heart drop through my eyes. I thought even if he said yes, I was prepared for it, but realizing he is dating a woman now, it really stunned me. He saw this, and told me to come outside so we can continue talking. He told me how he met this girl as a hookup, and she's my age, and tried to push her away multiple times. He mentioned how she just kept pushing to spend time with him, and then they just clicked when he gave her a chance. The entire time he was explaining this, I kept looking enthusiastic but he knew deep down I was breaking. He apologized and said that it just happened, that he couldn't control how he felt for her and that they got into a relationship only a few weeks prior. She's already met his family, and he said he really loves her. I just kept telling him ""good for you"" and told him in happy for him. I told him that I met a guy, and I lied to him saying we slept together, just to hurt him. He looked at me and told me he wish I didn't, and that how could I etc. I just looked at him like ""what the hell, really?"" Like his got a girlfriend now, and he's telling me off for sleeping with a guy? Regardless, it didn't really help the pain I started to feel. It only really hit me once I finished my haircut and left the barber. I got into the car and immediately burst out into tears. I hadn't dealt with the feelings I think of actually losing James, and now that he was dating someone, it was really over. I don't know what stupid fantasy world I was living in, maybe thinking there's a chance? I got home and was a wreck all night, just looking through old photos, videos, texts and crying.I messaged him the next day and told him the truth, that I never slept with any guys and only said that to hurt him. (An important note - me and James were always truthful to each other, we never ever hid anything from each other, no matter how messed up or humiliating it might have been, so its just important that I told him the truth.) He then called me and we then spoke for a couple hours on the phone, and I told him that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] struggling, he just kept apologizing, saying what we had was amazing, and to be strong and put myself out there. I told him I don't know how I can, I cant just get up and love someone else after a few months? I told him that I hadn't moved on from him, that every night I still think of him, everything still reminds me of him, it was just hard and it really sucked. He told me how he's always battling with his mental state, as to how he slept with a man even though he is straight. He says it gets hard for him but he deals with it. He told me he still loves me, and there will always be a part of him that loves me. He kept telling me that he's always here, no matter what, and he really wants to be friends. He wants to be friends, hang out just like we did when we first met, and as much as I wish it could happen, I just told him, for now, no, I just need space. We then spoke about old times, old memories, how things evolved from best friends to lovers. We cried a little. He told me that for him to love another man, its a special type of love because he's a straight guy. He said he will never ever experience what we had with someone else, but we both knew it would never work out. Which we did, we both knew it wouldn't work.What became really apparent over the years, was how shitty I felt for doing this to my best friend, whilst also feeling betrayed by him for all the times he would go see other people, even though I know he couldn't help it. I cant help but blame myself for not being able to control myself that night where we first became intimate, or backing off when I knew I was getting feelings for him. Writing this is the first time I've been able to let it out completely to anyone or anything. I've had to stop and cry multiple times.  
  
So now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a stage of not being sure on how to move on, the situation was doomed from the start but alas we are here now. Upon writing this and reflecting, I notice how much I've changed, and how much I lost myself throughout this entire experience. I was always the type of guy that could get through anything alone, I always saw myself as someone who is strong willed, can tough through life's challenges and come out on top every time, however I guess I was wrong, and here I am, not sure where to go from here, what to do, how to move on, how to love someone else or how to find contentment again. Because that's the thing, I haven't felt genuine contentment like I had when I was in James' presence. Happiness, yes, but contentment, no. It is only now that I realize it’s really over, and only now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to see how fucked I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I feel broken. I not only lost my soul mate, but my best friend. Before all of this we were just friends, and at times I wish it were still that way, but then I think about all the good times and reminisce.In the end, we loved each other, no matter how fucked up the situation was, or how badly we hurt each other. It's crazy how someone can break your heart, and yet you still find a way to love them with all the small pieces.I know that life is long, and it’s not the be all and end all, but I just don't know where to go from here.If you made it this far, thanks everyone for reading. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, and the way it’s written is probably rubbish, but it’s the first time I've ever done something like this, and I really just needed an avenue to let everything out. I couldn't possibly fit everything in here, it would turn into a twilight series.

apvq29,1549992225.0,2019-02-12 17:23:45,offmychest,Sitting in a therapist waiting room and I’m not being checked in so I guess I’ll post my story,"I’ve been wanting to unload my kind of sad life for a while on here because it seems like very few people really understand my situation and I think writing it all out will help me.

My childhood was very tame and kind of boring, relatively healthy family life with occasional arguments. I really only played video games and went to school when I was young since I didn’t really have a lot of friends that lived near me and I rarely got to invite people to come over.

My dad graduated from college when I was 12 years old and he began seeking a job as a teacher. My mom runs a business providing karaoke and dj services to restaurants and bars in my area. This is when things started getting bad at home. Mom would be out until 2, 3, or 4 in the morning and come home drunk often. Dad couldn’t sleep because he would worry about her. My dads anger would build up and he would become very irritable. He didn’t want to upset her so he would take it out on me since I was the oldest of two children and as a boy I’m supposed to “take it”. I remember he would pin me against a wall and slam his fist into the wall beside my head. He also once thought I stole his keys so he grabbed me and slung me around and threw me, only to later find his keys in his belt loop.

I started dating a girl when I was 15 and quickly fell in love with her and dated her for almost 2 years, she cheated and lied a lot. She ended up having sex with 2 or 3 of my best friends and it kind of emotionally destroyed me. I know a two year relationship isn’t exactly a huge deal but it was my first girlfriend and I was fairly torn up. Around the time that she first had sex with one of my best friends my dad left. That was in the early summer of 2017. I broke up with her in October of 2017. She attempted suicide and I had to have a friend drive to her house to stop her, she then dropped out of school.

When my dad left he took a job as a truck driver and only came home once every couple months, meaning I only really saw him around 12 times that first year he drove. Things started to fall apart with my mother and her best friend moved in with us. My mom swears her friend never acts like my parent but she gives her full access to my belongings and my room which I don’t think is appropriate. I had smoked weed a little bit after my parents separated and my mom knows about it and she basically tried controlling me in every way she could. I stopped smoking completely until I turned 18.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] 18 and I smoked a bit on my birthday and was smoking maybe every other day for about a month (it’s not legal where I live but with everything going on I needed something to take my mind off of my problems). She ended up finding out about it and basically tearing apart everything I owned to try to find everything I did (she found a klonopin that a dealer had thrown in my bag that I didn’t want, pills just aren’t my thing).

Moving out I finally realized how controlling she was, I was homeless for a week, and she took every cent I had. She ended up taking about 5 grand out of the bank so I couldn’t access it. She believes I just want to run away and go crazy which is not how it is at all. When my dad left I had to take over a lot of his responsibilities including taking care of my sister every night making it impossible to get a real job. She also held the things she paid for over my head, saying she paid for my insurance and my tuition for school, when in reality my dad paid for half of all of those expensive on top of the child support he paid.

In moms mind, even though dad paid half, she put the stamp on the envelope and therefore paid for it. She says how she is entitled to everything I own and I deserve no privacy because she paid for what I use. I’m now living with my father just because I was becoming so depressed I felt suicidal at home and couldn’t leave because I had to watch my sister.

Sorry this is really long, I just have been dealing with a lot.",1

","This is probably one of the hardest things I've ever done.  I don't normally talk to anyone about what is going on in my head and especially not what happened in my past but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the two have come full circle and I just need someone to listen, even if it is strangers on the internet, and I thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.  *Also should clarify [F] here*

The earliest memories I have are of living with my mom and my grandparents, around the age of 4, my parents split when I was less than a year old.  They never got into many of the details as to why the split happened but I think I have it figured out now.  But I digress, anyways, those were the last truly happy memories of my life.

The worst/cause of it started when I was 4, my mom met and married a new guy and we moved almost an hour away from my grandparents to go live with him.  I had met him and I believe we lived with him for a little while before the wedding (fuzzy on some details) but it all changed after the wedding.  My mom was working to support all three of us because her new husband was too lazy to find a job.  

About the time things seemed to fall into a routine, my (now ex) step-dad came into my room one morning after my mom left for work.  He was completely naked and woke me up and crawled into bed with me.  He touched me and made me touch him.  After it was all over, he grabbed me by my hair and drug me to a closet in the hallway, he got a box and made me stand on it so my head was a few inches below the bar used to hang things off of and he took a metal coat hanger and twisted it into a noose of sorts, and put it over my head while he wrapped the other end around the bar.  He made me stand there for what seemed like hours, naked and scared while he yelled at me about how he would kill me and my mom if I ever told anyone what he did/what he was going to do to me.  He had me completely terrified, then for both my mom and I.

After that, it started happening every day after my mom left for work, I started feeling sick to my stomach and every morning I would throw up in this trashcan I kept by my bed when I heard the door shut when my mom left, I remember it was always pinkish/red and tasted like what I now know as heartburn, if that makes sense.  

I think he really broke me the summer before I started kindergarten.  Looking back now, I realize it was because he was scared I would tell someone once I got to school.  He started making me 'touch' him more and he got more violent every time after it was over.  We have this wooden knife block that my mom still keep on her counter (she doesn't know any of this) and he would grab the biggest knife and hold it to my throat and used the tip to trace over my naked body while he described in detail the way he would torture and kill me and my mom and slice us to pieces if I ever told anyone. Something similar happened almost every day (save for Sundays when my mom was off).

This was about the time I noticed that he was abusive towards my mom as well, I never saw him hit her, but looking back now, that was probably going on by this time.  He was mainly just controlling and verbally abusive as fuck in front of me towards her, but he never hit her in front of me at this point.

After I started school, he would make me do things to him or do things to me every morning or else he wouldn't take me to school.  School became my escape from the living hell that was my home.  I never really had a lot of friends, I think the other kids could sense I was different from them and I spent a lot of time just reading or eventually in the gifted class.

Fast forward to March of my kindergarten year.  Things really haven't changed at all at home, if anything they have gotten worse.  But I started throwing up in school, like a few times a day, and my stomach hurt really badly all the time, but I thought it was from the abuse so I didn't say anything.  The nurse sent me home, after I begged her not to, for a week straight.  My step-dad had my mom convinced that I was just faking it to stay home but he stopped being as violent.  After another few days of me not eating/getting better, my mom made the executive decision to take me to the doctor.  The nurses/doctor looked me over and made me pee in a cup.  Turns out I had appendicitis, and it was apparently pretty bad.  My doctor told my mom to take me to the hospital NOW.  I remember passing out on the ride there and the next thing I remember is waking up in recovery and crying my eyes out because I was still alive and I knew things would eventually go back to the way they were.  Also turns out my appendix had ruptured, drs gave me a few days if I hadn't come in when I did.

I'll make the rest a bit more abridged for the reader's sake.  Basically the abuse continued even when his sons from another marriage moved in with us (Until then it had been just my mom, step-dad and me).  this is one part of the story no one knows. One night his oldest son came into my room while I was putting together a puzzle, he said I shouldn't be up so late on my own (it was like 1am and my mom and step-dad were asleep).  He told me to come into his room and he made me crawl under the covers with him and touch him.  I remember after it was over he told me that his dad said not to tell anyone 'or else' and I went back to my room and cried.  He never seemed the same after that and he never did it again.  I felt so betrayed that he knew what was going on and instead of stopping it, made it worse.  He moved back with his mom a few months after that and so did his younger brother (who by my standards was a saint, a man who didn't abuse me, not once, not ever).

My mom ended up getting pregnant around the time his kids left with my little brother.  I remember he seemed really happy about the pregnancy, especially when they found out it was a boy.  I remember one day before school asking him if he was going to do the same thing to my brother he was doing to me and begging him not to, to just do it to me and leave him alone.  He responded with something like 'Don't worry no son of mine is going to turn out to be a faggot'.  I think that is when I realized that none of this would be happening if I were a boy.

Things continued as normal, as sickening of a routine as it is, until one night my mom and him got into a really bad fight over something, I can't even remember if I ever knew what.  I was laying in my bad and I could hear them in the other room, yelling and screaming, way worse than normal.  I snuck out of my room and crept down the hallway, I crawled on all fours to the living room and watched as he threw my mom, 8 or 9 mos pregnant onto the couch and threw a laundry basket at her, she struggled and eventually got up and tried to make her way into the kitchen to call the cops, he ripped the phone out of the wall and grabbed her by her hair and yelled at her.  I went back into my room and cried myself to sleep scared to death I was going to lose my brother before he was born.

Fast forward a month or so, my mom had my brother, everything was normal and they were both sent home on time.  The happiest time of my life, while they were married, was while my mom was on maternity leave, I got to hang out with my mom and little brother and I didn't have to touch my step-dad nearly as much.  He still came into my room at night after my mom went to sleep sometimes.

After my mom went back to work, things went back to the way they used to be although not for long.  A month or so after she went back to work, she picked me up from school and said we were moving in with one of her friends from work and that we were never going back to the house we used to live in ever again.  I have never been so happy as in that moment and I will forever love and respect my mother for having the courage to leave an abusive situation, even if she didn't know the half of it, which I am [REDACTED_NAME] she knew nothing about the abuse, I have one hell of a pokerface when I feel the life of a loved one depends on it, especially my mom.

There is the first part of my life story, I will post more later.  Even if no one reads this, it feels amazing just to type it out.

Also, if you have read this massive wall o' text, I thank you kindly, it really does mean a lot to me.  ",45
2b7g6r,1405860847.0,2014-07-20 12:54:07,offmychest,I had sort of a 'relationship' with a 28 years old man when I was around 15 and now at 19 I still don't know how I feel about it (Please help?),"Ok so I’m a 19 years old girl and this happened when I was 15/16 so around three years ago. I’ve never told anyone and I feel like I’m never gonna be completely over it until I get it off my chest. I lurk this subreddit pretty often so I thought it’d be appropriate to write my story and post it. 


This is reeeally long, so if you read the whole thing, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Also I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for any mistakes, English is not my first language.  


I was a really shy and quiet child that enjoyed being alone, always reading, and didn’t make friends easily. I was bullied pretty badly at school and my self-esteem was terrible. I used to sit and hang out with a big group of girls but only after the teachers saw me alone all the time and talked to them and convinced them to become my “friends”. They were nice enough, but I didn’t even liked them because we had nothing in common. That went on for two years before I just couldn’t bear it and started sitting alone again and stopped talking to them (I’d be nice if they tried to talk to me but it was clear that I wanted to be left alone and they didn’t care that much anyway), so I spent the next year alone, reading all the time. It was a little lonely, but nice. Then I started making friends with some of the more “alternative” crowd, so to speak. Me and another girl started to sit with these two guys, an (both self-proclaimed) anarchist and a fascist/neo-nazi who were best friends. Yeah, I know. We had some lively arguments. 


Then I went to another high school and lost contact with all of them. I was very lonely, and this was when I met the man that this post is about on Facebook. I commented on a post by a younger girl I knew (I think it was a pic of her new bunny or something cute like that?) and he commented too and started talking to me. He soon sent me a private message and we kept talking. We seemed to have an unbelievable amount of things in common. Our favourite author was the same, and it was one that wasn’t popular at all in my country, he was actually the first person that I met that had read his books too. It was amazing. He asked me for my email to keep talking and I gave it to him without hesitation. In no time at all he sent me a really long email and I responded in the same way, starting an email conversation that lasted a couple of weeks. The emails were extremely long and we usually exchanged one each day, if not more. He was extremely friendly and made me feel really great. We talked about everything, and he complimented me a lot, but not in an inappropriate way. We kept discovering things we had in common - We were both atheists (I was surrounded by really religious people and this was amazing to me), we both loved the English language (he had actually lived in England for a few years, which I was enchanted by, since it had been a dream of mine for a very long time… off topic but I’m currently living there whooo) and much more… We exchanged pictures, and he said I was very beautiful. No one had said that about me before. When we talked about our ages he kept saying how ‘age is just a number’ and talking about how mature I was and stuff like that, but also said that if I wasn’t comfortable being friends with an adult man like him he’d understand and stop talking to me. He was 28. I of course said I didn’t care and that I didn’t want to stop talking to him. Then we kept getting closer. I told him about how I never wanted to have kids and didn’t believe in marriage and all that and he said that he didn’t believe in soulmates but if he did he would think that I was his soulmate. Of course, I was extremely flattered.


For this couple of weeks all I could think about was our emails, literally all the time. I was consumed by it. I didn’t pay attention at school, I went to the laptop straight away when I got home and I spent hours crafting my reply to his latest email and then anxiously waiting for him to respond. I went to bed late and slept little. 


He lived in my same city, so of course soon we started to talk about meeting up in person. Finally we decided to go to the cinema together. Basically I was a fucking idiot and didn’t think about my safety even once. At least I got the ‘meeting in a public place’ part right, but I knew that my parents wouldn’t let me meet up with someone like him in a million years (they didn’t know about him obviously) so I lied and said that I was going to go to the cinema with some girls from school. I was really lucky that nothing went wrong, but if something had happened to me my family wouldn’t even know, I’d have just disappeared. I regret taking such a risk - If you’re meeting someone from the internet, remember to be safe! Tell a friend or something! 


Anyway, I tried to make myself look pretty and went to meet him. He hugged me tight at soon as he saw me and I laughed a little awkwardly because I was terribly nervous (almost shaking, really) and we went to see our movie, Sucker Punch. After that, we went for a walk and then into a coffee shop. He gave me a present, a really nice edition of the Sin City movie, that we both loved. I was so incredibly happy and thanked him profusely. We didn’t talk much because I was (and still am) very awkward and find difficult to keep conversations going. But he said he didn’t care. He gave me a very long hug when we said goodbye (as he always did every time after that, also when we said hello) and as soon as I got home I saw that I already had an email from him telling me that he missed me.


We started seeing each other at least once a week. I guess it never really was a relationship, not properly, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] from an outside perspective we looked like a couple. He taught me to play Magic The Gathering and gave me one of his old decks. I didn’t want to accept it because it was rare and valuable but he put it in my bag when I wasn’t looking and I discovered when I got home. We lent each other books (I got him to read the hunger games, which he told me he loved, he got me to read ender’s game which honestly i didn’t like at all). He also bought some books that he knew I wanted to read for me, he paid for coffee and other small stuff when we went out, and gave me a few more gifts… to the point where I started to be uncomfortable with it. I tried to reject them most times and pay for myself when I could, but I was (still am, kind of, but got much better) very bad at communicating how I feel, specifically negative emotions, and I didn’t want to seem ungrateful. 


By now I was going out a lot more often than I had a few months before, and of course my parents noticed and wanted to know who I was hanging out with. I told them a little about him but just enough so they wouldn’t worry, and lied saying that he was only a couple years older than me. My mother never saw him, my father only once, when he came to pick me up from a park we had been walking around in after it started storming really bad. The rain was heavy and he couldn’t see him clearly from inside the car, and we left immediately. 


Sometimes when we met at the center of the city he went with me on the bus back home and then walked back to his own house, which was almost an hour away on foot. I told him he didn’t need to do that but he said he wanted to make sure I was safe. He was really big on the ‘being a gentleman’ thing. He held doors open for me, always walked on the side that was closer to the road and sometimes even grabbed my arm/waist to move me out of the way or held my hand to cross the street and stuff like that. He held my hand a lot when we were walking anywhere. He called me pretty or beautiful *a lot* (also said stuff like ‘you’re not like other girls’ and other things that today would seem kinda sexist to me /: ) and stuff like princess, etc. When we were sitting in a bench he always got very close to me and tried to cuddle me and sometimes touch my face and kissed my hand a lot. To his credit he told me that if I was uncomfortable I only had to tell him to stop, but as I said before, I had trouble communicating stuff and I found that impossible even when I did have a problem with it. I think I was visibly uncomfortable sometimes though, but maybe he never realized. He claimed to be very awkward and bad at social interaction, just like me. 


A few times he surprised me by waiting for me at the door of my high school to see me when I got out of my classes, he walked me home (around 10 minutes) and then he’d go back to his house by bike. Some people in my class even asked me if he was my father. I said no, just a friend, and that was it. 


At that time I was the admin of a forum for young writers (we had a couple of boys but mostly it was teenage girls) and because he also liked to write, I let him join. I regret this decision a lot. He was nice and polite to everyone but he clearly didn’t belong to that kind of space. He posted some of his stories, a couple of which had some strong sexual content, and only asked if that kind of thing was ok after posting. Before that we only had only had one other writer that wrote some mild slash/yaoi from time to time, but I said sure, we were ok with it. 


He worked on a video store, and had studied something related to filmmaking. He said that he really liked one of my stories that I posted on the forum and talked a lot about turning it into a short film. I was excited but wary, and honestly now I think it was bullshit. He made a few claims that were pretty unbelievable from time to time, like that he was a master at karate and had worked as a bodyguard for a few years, but he was quite skinny and honestly didn't look very strong.


One day he took me to his house to show me something. He still lived with his parents in a pretty big house on the old part of the city. His room was full of anime posters and figurines. There were soda cans everywhere too. He explained that it wasn’t normally like that and that he was saving them for a ‘project.’ Then he took me to a storage room they had and showed me some katanas he had. Honestly it was all really weird, and I started to be seriously uncomfortable around him. 


We met up again and I felt gross and disgusted every time he touched me. After less than an hour where I was really cold towards him he asked me if I was ok and I said that I hadn’t slept much that night (I had serious problems with sleep and he knew this, but it was just an excuse) and that I wanted to go home. I insisted on taking the bus alone. By then I believe he knew something wasn’t right, and tried to talk to me about it by email, but I wouldn’t admit anything was wrong. I just couldn’t stand his presence anymore. I was totally repulsed by his smell, his voice, how he treated me, everything that I once liked. I didn’t want to see him anymore but I still had one book of his, so I told him to come to my house one afternoon my parents weren’t there, so I could return it. Once he was there he tried to make me keep the book and give me another one, maybe so we’d have to see each other again, but I didn’t want to and refused it. I told him he had to go because my parents were coming back, but in reality they were gone until the next day, I just was very anxious and wanted him gone. He asked me if I was angry at him or something and I said I wasn’t. I let him hug me for a second before pulling away and closing the door on him, and that was the last time I saw him. 


He sent me a few emails after that but I never read them. I sent him one a few days later saying that my parents didn’t want me to talk to him anymore because I needed to focus on studying. Just a bunch of excuses that I hoped were convincing enough so he’d leave me alone. I then made a filter so any emails of his went directly to the bin, I deleted all the emails we had exchanged, I unfriended him on facebook and deleted his account on my forum and all his stories and comments, etc. I just wanted him out of my life. 



I was quite anxious for a few weeks, but he never contacted me again. I just tried to go on with my life and not think about it. For the longest time I couldn’t think about the whole thing without feeling terrible, and I was so confused about it. Sometimes I even missed him, but I knew I had done the right thing, even if sometimes I couldn’t help but wonder if I was too harsh. He never tried to even kiss me and never made any overtly sexual advances (though I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and kinda oblivious to that sort of thing so I don't even knowl...), but looking back at it, his behaviour does seem kinda predatory to me. Maybe he was sincere, though immature, or maybe it was just a question of time until it escalated into something worse and I was lucky that I got out early. The whole thing was just maybe half a year I think? And the fact is that he helped my self-esteem a lot and introduced me to some stuff that I still love today, so I don’t quite feel like I could say that I was taken advantage of… But man, when I think about it now I just can’t think that it was healthy. I was just a kid! And I’m sure I looked like one too, I’ve always looked younger than I am. I still feel like I’m so young.


I guess I just really need someone’s else perspective to help me stop mulling over it, and sort out my feelings about the past so I can really move on with my life and forget it.

1xkznx,1392090450.0,2014-02-11 03:47:30,offmychest,"Had to make a new account just to post this. I've been trying to tell my story for years, and i can't stomach what people would think of me.","Sorry Reddit, this is a long one.

My dad and I have had a horrible relationship for no reason and the last time I talked to him was when I was ten. We originally saw each other very often and my memories with him are fantastic.

One night he tucked me in my room at his house (parents never wed) and put on Fantasia because it helped me sleep. He woke me up in the middle of the night drunk off his ass and told me he couldn't sleep alone and asked if I wanted to come in his bed. I said yes and trudged behind him, tired as hell. 

When we got into bed he told me that ""every girl is going to be touched my a man"" and he wanted to be the first, because he was the most important male in my life. I didn't really understand because I was so young, maybe 7 or 8, and to be honest I was afraid of him because he was so large. Tall and muscular that is, not fat.

He slid off my pants and started touching me. Just sliding his fingers around not inserting them or anything. While he did it, he told me the name each part that he touched; clitoris...labia....you get the point. 

I had to take breaks while he was going about whatever it was he thought he was accomplishing, to go to the bathroom. I would try to pee and nothing would come out, but as I grew up I realized it must have been the first time I felt horny. Right? 

Each time I returned from the bathroom he seemed more and more aggressive. He touched my anus and told me it was my ""goose hole"" and to never let anyone touch it because it was his. What the fuck is a goose hole. He then inserted his finger. Probably pinky because it didn't hurt that bad but I remember a little pain. 

He began touching my clitoris while his finger was sort of in my anus. Then his finger went into my vagina. He began rapidly rubbing around and sticking his fingers inside me while I choked back tears because it hurt so bad. He kept telling me I was a good girl to let him be first. Then he asked if I wanted to touch him.

I shook my head because words wouldn't come out. He stood up pulled his boxers right down. I stared at a penis for the first time. He then knelt on the bed so I was laying and his dick was right by my face. ""You still don't want to touch me?"" 

I stood my 7 or 8 year old ground and said no and buried my face in the pillow. It was wrong. It was all wrong. He said fine and just laid next to me. Both our pants off. Both of us facing the same way, his hand cupping my waist. 

I woke up the next morning hoping it was a dream. I lifted up the covers so slowly and saw my underwear but not pants on my body. And next to be was a bare penis. 

I tried to creep out of the bed and immediately as I go to swing my legs onto the floor, I feel a pair of fingers reach into the back of my underwear, and drag me back against his body. 

""It never happened"" he whispered in my ear. It was venom.

I laid quiet for a minute, and mumbled something like breakfast and went out into the kitchen to join my grandparents in eating pancakes.

He came out about an hour later happy as a clam. We never spoke of it again.

It only happened once, and I still went over there often. But then he stopped communicating with me when I was ten. I've tried to hunt him down but he moved and changed every number and remains a mystery. But for some reason I wan to go to the same college he did. I cry very day because he wants nothing to do with me. 

Why am I so desperate for the attention of someone who molested me and scarred me for life? It doesn't make sense. And to this day I haven't told anyone. But for some reason, writing it all down made me feel like I ""had to go to the bathroom"". Which makes even less sense.

I fucking hate myself for wanting him in my life and feeling like that as I wrote that down. He is a vile excuse of a man, but I still love him. I need his love and I don't know why. I don't even know how to end this. 

Sorry it was so long. I'm 18 now, and just need some advice. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sorry if this was the wrong sub to post to. This is a big step for me, even though it's just a post on Reddit. Thanks for reading. ",4
4z4cea,1471920539.0,2016-08-23 02:48:59,offmychest,I was almost murdered. I've never told anyone. I need to own my story. **Trigger warning domestic violence & rape,"Firstly, a foreward:


It's been a long road leading me to type this right now. If you've ever heard of Brene Brown, you'll know where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] from. She's the researcher on shame, guilt, fear, vulnerability. I suffer from severe PTSD. She preaches that in order to overcome shame, we must own our story. It was only recently I realized I even felt ashamed. But I'm [REDACTED_NAME], deeply ashamed. So ashamed, I can't speak of this to anyone I know personally. So off my chest is goes, and I tell my story. For the first time, for no other point than to tell it. Here goes.


Hi reddit,
I'm a 25 year old UX designer (I make websites pretty). I'm a single mother to a 4 year old boy. He rocks. He's my whole world. I live in a nice city, a small one. I grew up in los angeles. I lived there for 20 years.


Actually, I came here in the first place because I fled. I fled my abuser, my home, my friends. You see after a while, they all become one. So inextricably intertwined. I couldn't tell one from the other, my face from my nose. I ran. I was forced. I was kidnapped. I left. These are all true, it just depends how you want to look at it.


You see when I was 17 I met a guy. Not a nice guy necessarily, but a really really cool guy. He was so handsome. He had the dopest tattoos. He had a new york accent. He was so...different. Exactly what I was looking for. And he liked me too! Oh how he liked me.
After we were dating, things were fine for about a month. He was controlling and jealous, but not enough to break up over. Just enough to barely blip on my radar. Then one day, we were having friends over. You see we lived in the place to live. If this was NY, imagine we lived in the center of times square. People came up to party with us all the time. Strangers, randoms, all was welcome.
So one night we have people over, one friend of mine and some randoms/acquaintances. 


One random guy is super nice, he's a cop (I confirmed, he was off-duty). He tells me he's rolling. I offer to give him a massage, because I used to take ecstasy too and I know how nice it is. I ask my bf for permission first, he says go ahead.


At some point the guy put his head in my lap. My bf walked over and slapped me. He doesn't deserve privacy, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to call him by his name. His name was Chase. At least that's what he went by. It was his middle name, really his first name was Connor.



He just slapped me right in the fucking face. I was appalled, in shock, and everybody silently left. Everybody, silently, left. When I type that I feel hot knives searing my stomach. Fuck you guys. They were all men. All much bigger and braver than I was. I remember the cop saying ""I feel like I should leave you guys alone now..""
and that was it. They left. And I stayed. I stayed. It was a light slap after all. It didn't hurt. It just surprised me. I guess I'd crossed a line that I never saw drawn in the sand. Of course I shouldn't have done that. What woman in her right mind would've let that guy put his head in my lap? I was acting afool. I was lowering myself. He was just lifting me up to the standards I should be holding myself too. Plus, he apologized. He was deeply sorry that he lost his temper.
I mean, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] perfect? How can he be? Plus his slap didn't even hurt. It's not like I'm a battered woman. It's not like I could possibly ever become that. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] no risk. I forgave a one time mistake and that's it. It ever happens again and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you. You bet your ass I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you.



And it didn't happen again for a long time. But I just kept fucking up. I didn't know what was wrong with me, but I just kept fucking up. I was getting reminders. I looked at the delivery guy too long when he brought our pizza. My old guy friend texted me to see how I was doing. I exchanged pleasantries with our doorman. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was really fucking up. He told me all about it afterwards. I didn't realize how I was disrespecting him, but the way I talked to other guys made them think I was into them you see? They all thought I liked them! And the ones that liked me, well that was because I made them think that. Even if I said nothing, I looked like a ""w**re"" so they thought I was easy.


It's funny, they never liked me because I was smart, funny, pretty, or interesting. But only because I looked easy. I took note and changed the way I dressed. Started averting my eyes. I stared at my shoes. I forgot people's names. There's no point when they're all the same.



You see to him I was the tornado. He was the volcano. Yeah -- he loved that song.


I started to learn my lessons. I grew to adapt. I was a chameleon in a chameleon's world. I learned my place. I looked down. I spoke when spoken to. I knew the look. The look that said it all. The look that chills me to my bones as I type this.


But then came the big day. The one you're probably reading this for. The ""juicy bits."" It was August 6th of 2010. (My son was born on this exact day 2 years later.)


He bought pills that day - xanax. 2 mg. I remember. He took a lot. I took a few too. We sat by the pool at our apartment complex, in sweltering heat, our shirts sticking to our skin. We made plans for the day, for the evening, everything seemed so bright.


My memory is spotty here, so bare with me please. At some point, we argued about something. He demanded we go up to my room. I refused, I stayed behind with friends. I took a stand. Finally.
You could see the pool from my room, and vice versa. He stormed up. I could see him watching me. I watched the lights flicker on and off - you see it was night, so he could only see me with the lights off.
Eventually I say, hey I'll go up, I'll see what's wrong. I go up and he's dranken a fifth of vodka to himself. He seems passed out on the couch. I go near to see if he's okay, and he bursts up, pointing a knife at me.


I don't remember what he said. But it was scary enough that I backed out the door, and ran to the elevator. He caught up with me. He was bigger, taller, faster, stronger. I frantically pushed the down button. I punched that button with all my might. He made it first.
I felt a sharp blow to my upper thigh and I was on the floor. Then my keys flew into the wall, lodging just above my eye, sticking straight out. I grasped my leg, already bruising, and tried to get to my feet. He kicked me. He fucking kicked me with all his force.
I ran back into the apartment. I grabbed a kitchen knife. I remember saying ""You think you're the only one that can pull a knife?"" I don't remember what he said.


Next I remember trying to flee the apartment. He grabbed me so hard, caught my clothes that he tore them clean off me. I didn't even think that was possible. At some point I made it downstairs and ran to a friend's apartment. From there I ran to the apartment complex across the street. Our weed dealer lived there. I trusted him.
He saw how fucked up I was. I was crying and my nose was bleeding. I had a black eye too. The first words out of his mouth will be burned into my memory forever. He said ""Alice...I've wanted you from the moment I saw you."" I said ""Chase beat me"" and he ushered me to his bed ready to tuck me in and comfort me. He gave me a pill to help me feel better.


The next thing I remember is waking up and he's trying to have sex with me. He's trying to shove it in, I have my legs shut tight. I'm [REDACTED_NAME], so, so hard. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] no. The next thing I remember he is getting up to throw away the condom.


He carries me home. Lays me down in my bed. Chase bursts out from the bathroom (he was hiding in there, why? only makes sense to him I'm [REDACTED_NAME]). He grabbed my bong and smashed it. And then he walked over and punched me in the head as hard as he could (he admitted that later). I saw stars, colors, heard noises, and I was out. When I woke up Alex (dealer) was gone. It must've just been a few minutes. He threw me out of the bed. He choked me up against the wall. He punched me in the face. Over and over. I was crawling. Trying to get away. He grabbed two butcher knives. He cut my throat with one, the other he poked at my stomach, stabbing at my flesh.


I screamed as loud as I could. I cried for my mommy, my daddy, the police, god. I was about to die and I knew it.


I keep crawling. Finally I'm [REDACTED_NAME] some progress. I've reached the door. Thank fucking god. If I can just reach the handle. But he's back again. And I feel a blow to my head so hard I think my brain is leaking out. He kicked my head. He's kicking my head. Over and over. Against the bathroom door frame. My cheek is broken, I can feel it. My brain is swelling, I swear I can feel it. And I'll never get away.


Then he does the unthinkable. Yanks my dress up and starts jamming his fingers into me while screaming ""is this what alex did to you is this what you want you fucking slut."" I guess Alex told him we had sex. They fucking smoked a cigarette together before abusing me.


Alex saw him punch me. He fucking left. A rapist and a coward.
The last thing I remember is my head getting kicked in. The next thing I remember is waking up the next morning with 12 officers at my door. They arrest him. I look in the mirror. I look like an alien. I collapse. I have no memory. They take me to the hospital. I have severe concussions. Fractures. My throat was slit. I look like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] dead.


He's arraigned.

Sometimes I feel like I forgive you Chase, and sometimes I feel like strangling you slowly while watching the life calmly leave your eyes and furiously masturbating to the sight of it. 

And I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I just can't anymore. If anyone reads this, I can tell the rest of the story tomorrow. But not tonight. Not tonight.
Anyone going through the same thing I know you feel the same way, but you're NOT alone and you ARE strong and capable and beautiful. Please, if you're in need, reach out to me and I'll be here night and day for you. It only gets worse my babies.


I doubt anyone read this, but if you did, you're a trooper, thanks for hearing my story.",5
mzljd,1322987744.0,2011-12-04 08:35:44,offmychest,My story.,"I just want to get my story out.  It’s going to be a long post and I don’t expect it to be read.  But I just want to get it out me.  

I was born almost twenty one years ago.  My dad bailed before I was born so my mom being young, moved back home halfway across the country to live with my grandparents and they helped raise me.  My mom went to college to become a nurse.  

When I was in the fourth grade, my friend’s cousin who was only two years older than me told me about a club that he was in and told me that he wanted to initiate me into it.  I wanted to fit in so badly.  So I said okay.  He took me to the side of the house and sexually assaulted me.  I felt uncomfortable about it, but I didn’t think it was wrong.  It took a while to realize what really happened that day.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] going to go into further discussion about this topic.

My grandpa was an alcoholic.  He lost his job when I was nine.  My grandma had to go to work in his place.  He was incredibly depressed after losing his job.  He rarely left the bed and drank heavily.  Nearly a year after losing his job, he told my grandma that she should probably take him to the hospital.  He had grown so weak that he couldn’t walk to the car.  He was too tall for my grandma or mom to carry, he was about six foot and my mom and grandma are five foot six and five foot four.  My mom sent me out to the neighbors house.  The neighbor kids asked me what was happening and if he was going to die.  I don’t remember what I said.

I remember visiting him in the hospital.  One day I thought he was getting a lot better because when I walked in he called me by my nickname, something he hadn’t done in a long time, and I was so happy that he was going better I started crying tears of joy.

Two weeks after being submitted to the hospital he died from liver failure.  We didn’t have a funeral, having recently filed for bankruptcy. 

The rest of that year was a blur.  I was bullied a lot.  It started because for class we watched Where The Red Fern Grows and I started crying because of deaths.  My grandpa was a huge sucker for dog movies and I was still struggling with the concept of death.  My teacher pulled me aside to talk about it.  My friend and her friend wrote me an email calling me pathetic for crying at the movie and told me I was poorly dressed and that they didn’t want to be my friend anymore.  I spent a lot of that year alone.  My grades suffered greatly.  

Things got a lot better during sixth grade.  I made friends and was doing a lot better.  My grandma moved to live with my great-grandmother, which I was okay with.  I missed her, but I was fine.

My mom was severely depressed for a while.  I didn’t realize it at the time.  She took care of my grandma when my grandpa had died and she was the one who called everyone and she didn’t really get time to grieve.  

I suffered from low self-esteem in middle school.  I started burning and cutting myself in ninth grade.  I went through long bouts of suicidal thoughts.  I was once ready to do it, but my mom came home early from work that day and I realized what I was about to do, so ran outside and hugged her, crying.  She asked me why I was crying, I told her I just missed her.  

I started talking to my dad when I was fourteen.  We met when I was fifteen.  We talk infrequently because he’s in and out of jail for DUIs quite a bit.  

My junior year was the first I had been happy in a long time.  I liked my job, I had a great group of friends and I was even on honor roll.  I was happy for about six months.  Then one day it just came crashing down.  Nothing really changed except I was happy, and then I wasn’t.  My mom realized what was going on this time and took me the counselor that she went to when she was depressed.  I was put on an anti-depressant.  It didn’t make me happy, but made me feel like I could be happy one day.

My senior year didn’t start out well.  I was supposed to visit my dad, but I had to cancel the trip because he was arrested for failure to follow court orders after his previous DUI charge.  My friends had started getting into drinking and smoking pot.  The anniversary of my grandfather’s death was coming up.  My friends started drinking and I freaked out because of my dad’s DUI and my grandpa’s alcohol-related death and had to be taken home by a sober friend there when I was supposed to be spending the night.  

While my Dad was in jail he sent me the lyrics of “Hate Me” by Blue October.  

I told my mom about why I came home early.  She and one of my friend’s moms were talking about it one day and there was a misunderstanding.  Group of friends started bullying and excluding me.  I went through another suicidal period.  I made good friends with one of my coworkers.  He helped me out a lot during that time.  He’s still one of my closest friends.  I stopped cutting and burning myself.

I spent my lunches during my senior year hanging out with various teachers.  Teachers have always liked me which I thought was odd because I’ve never been great at turning in school work.  But that’s where I spent my time.

I went to university near me after I graduated.  I moved into the dorms and I was doing okay.  My Dad and I were talking again and I visited him before I started college.  I did poorly in my classes.  I’m still ashamed of this.  My mom took me back to the counselor.  I was diagnosed with ADD.  

I began dating someone whom I had a crush on since I was sixteen.  Things were great for a while, but then he grew distant and cold.  We dated for a couple months and broke up.  Then we got back together a month later.  I switched to a community college because I still didn’t know what I wanted to do and didn’t want to waste any more money just drifting through college classes.  I was not doing well.  I was going through another suicidal period and told the boyfriend.  He didn’t do anything about it.  He then used me to get off.  That was the last time I saw him.  I saw my counselor again.  She told me to break up with him asap.  I tried getting ahold of him, but I couldn’t.  So I wrote him a letter and packed up his stuff and left it on a box on his doorstep.

I struggled with things for a while, but after a while I was doing a lot better.  I haven’t talked to my Dad in over nine months.  His phone has been disconnected and I haven’t got another way to reach him.

I have a great set of friends.  My mom is dating someone who is a nerd and got me involved with his rpg-ing group.  I brought my coworker friend and the nine to eleven of us play Pathfinder every week.  I reconnected with some of my better friends from high school.  Over all, I’m not complaining too much about life right now.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] introverted and introspective because of how  much time I spent alone growing up.  I’m comfortable that way.  I’ve dated a bit since my ex, but nothing significant.  I’m pretty self-sufficient.  I use humor as a way of coping with things.  It takes a while for me to trust people.  Men a little bit more than women.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] better about letting people get closer to me.  ",6

3bofde,1435698609.0,2015-06-30 21:10:09,offmychest,"My story of addiction, naivety, and hell. If you are going to use drugs, Know what you're using!!","This is my first reddit post EVER so please go easy on me. Let me start off by saying that I am 23 now, but at the time I was 19, freshly moved out of Mom and Dad's house. I have always had every opportunity I could imagine, lived in a wealthy area, I was what MOST would consider spoiled. I had always been curious about drugs but never had the balls to actually try them. I had absolutely no experience with drugs other than my incredibly naive second hand knowledge about them. I had grown up believing that all drugs were the devil and you should never get close to them, if you made eye contact with someone on drugs you immediately drop dead and your puppy has to be put down. Ok maybe not that intense but it's the same kind of small town-esque perspective on drugs that you are picturing in your head right now. So to me, there was weed, ecstasy, coke, heroin, and meth. Those were drugs stay away from them. 

     This is where the story begins. When I was about 16, I was walking past my mother inside of our home when i noticed she had an orange pill bottle full of hexagon shaped little pinkish orange pills, and watched her take one. My teenage curiosity reared its head, and although I had never taken or even had a thought about taking someone else's Rx, i figured why the hell not. No clue what it was, or what it was for but my mom took them, so obviously it wasn't going to kill me. That was my reasoning. So later that night I went into the cabinet where she kept these pills and I opened the bottle, and swallowed one. This was at about 7PM. A couple hours later it was bedtime for me and I honestly had forgotten all about taking the pill, so i curled up and went to bed like normal. At some point in the middle of the night, I woke up from a dead sleep. I noticed that I had waves of euphoria rushing over me, a glowing ball of happiness emanating from the pit of my stomach, and my nose was itchy. I would scratch it and more waves of euphoria. It was like I had woken up in heaven. I fell back asleep and then I woke up in the morning feeling normal but i remembered the events in the middle of the night, still not registering that it was from the pill I had taken, I chalked it up to the idea that I was just dreaming, half awake or some nonsense that I told my self. 

     Weeks had passed since that incident, and out of the blue the thought of those little orange pills popped into my head again. Thats when all of the pieces came together and i hypothesized that it was the pills that had given me that heavenly euphoria. When I got home from school that day, I immediately went to the cupboard and tossed a pill down my throat. It dawned on me, hmm maybe I should look at the bottle. The drug was called suboxone, and I had never heard of it, all i knew was that my mom had a steady supply and she obviously didn't notice when they went missing. 

    For those of you that don't know, Suboxone is basically a synthetic Opiate that is given to people who are trying to quit heroin or other opiates to relieve the withdrawal symptoms, then they slowly ween off of the suboxone until their body is completely non-dependant on drugs. Or at least that's the idea. Something that is not very well known is that doctors back in 2002?-2005? (don't quote me on that, best guess) were actually prescribing this drug as an anti-depressant, but it was only if EVERY other Rx had failed. It was the last ditch effort Rx. put two and two together and my Mother was a Very depressed person. At the time I didn't know this, and I didn't know what suboxone was, I was just about as in the dark as you could get. 

     about 30 mins after I popped that pill, I felt tingles from the base of my spine up to the top of my head, and immediately felt light and energetic. I had that glowing ball of radiating ecstasy coming from my stomach, and it was as strong as ever. Keep in mind, this drug is given to heroin users to relieve withdrawal, and if it is strong enough to relieve withdrawal, then it was definitely strong enough to send 16 year old drug-virgin me to the straight to the sky. That night, even though I was as relaxed as I had ever felt in my life, I couldn't fall asleep. I laid in my bed just basking in the glow, thinking thoughts that fed into my happiness. I watched the sun rise at about 6:00 am and decided I should get up. For not having slept all night, I had an incredible amount of energy and I was in an unbelievably great mood. As the day came to an end, I still had that feeling, but it had reduced itself to a ""content"" feeling. I slept that night and woke up the next day feeling pretty normal, no craving for the pills, not even a thought about it. Weeks later, I told my my friend Brooks about this miracle pill. He was just as drug-naive as I was and he agreed to try it out. Brooks spent the night, we popped the orange dream pills and were hit with euphoria. Brooks told me that he felt like he had to puke, but he didn't even care because he was so happy. 

     That was the last time I had taken the drug for a while. Until about 3 years later, after i moved out on my own. One day, I randomly got the urge to pop and orange dream pill. No matter, go to my parent's house, check the cupboard. This time, there weren't pills in a bottle, but rather thin paper-like strips, same orange color. The first and only smart decision that I made during this escapade . I went hope, carefully cut off a tiny corner of the strip, put it in my mouth and felt that familiar feeling. This time it was intensified. I stayed up all night playing video games, listening to music, and generally just being happy. 

     Before long, I was stealing a strip every couple of weeks. Then it turned into once a week. Then twice a week. pretty soon I realized that this was probably not a good idea. This thought was provoked by the fact that I was starting to notice in the days when i hadn't taken this, I felt.... Off. Not quite sad, but definitely not normal. I also realized that I had built up an incredible tolerance when I put an entire strip in my mouth, and this time, I didn't get that creeping glow of euphoria. I just felt bleh. I really need to stop doing this, I thought. This is the last time. 

     About a week later, I still hadn't taken any more and I was feeling off. At the time, I didn't quite realize I was feeling different, and I definitely didn't think it was from the drugs, because I had stopped, and they are safe right? they're from the doctor. They can't be that bad. Boy was I wrong. after a night of partying at a friend's house about a week and a half later, I had an exceptionally brutal hangover, which was weird because I didn't drink near as much as I was used to drinking.  I went home and went back to bed. I woke up at about noon, I had a pounding headache and I had that anxious feeling in my stomach, but this wasn't just physical. I was off. not right. I couldn't explain it. That night, I still didn't feel normal. But i brushed it off. That night I fell asleep, and I had a dream that I would never forget. I was going out to dinner with family and co-workers, everyone around me was happy, smiling, enjoying life. But as I sat at the restaurant table, I was not feeling the same. I felt sick. Tired. Sad. But not the normal kind, this was different. It had a hint of evil. it was like in this dream, I was in a parallel universe, where I was void of happiness, but i couldn't convey or get anyone to see what It was that I felt, and everyone around me was so blissful, I felt like I was missing out on some secret that everyone knew but me, I felt left behind. 

     I assume that this dream was the beginning of my body starting to go into withdrawal. I had never felt like that before. It was horrible. I woke up that morning feeling like I was ready to cry. For no reason. I didn't feel rested, I was tired. I had a headache, a backache, no energy or appetite. I felt horrible. maybe I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sick? I thought. In the next couple days realized two things. One-Maybe it was those feel good pills that caused this? Two- I really think it was those feel good pills, because i feel like death. Finally, it made sense. I knew why i was feeling the way I was. It was withdrawal. but not just any withdrawal, Opiate withdrawal. Constant shivers, sweating, sneezing, aches the whole shebang. These withdrawals were not as intense as what i believe Heroin withdrawals would be like, but here's my best attempt at describing the over-all feeling:

     Picture that you are at the one place in the world where you feel most comfortable, most safe. Maybe it's your home, maybe grandmas house, whatever. Now picture you are there in that place, but its not quite right. Things are a little bit dull, a little bit fuzzy. The normal green lush beautiful vegetation looks worn, maybe even brown. Like at the end of fall when plants start to shrivel as the temperatures drop. Now you realize that you don't feel right in your safe place, you don't even feel comfortable. In fact, you need to go to your safe place just to get rid of the feelings you have in this progressively dull, sad version of the place where you used to come to refresh your soul. But the thing is, you can't go to your safe place. you're already there. 

     I felt homesick, even though I hadn't gone anywhere. I had barely slept in days, and the absolute worst part of it all was that I did not tell ONE person about what I was going through, what I had done to get myself there. I was alone in this sense, and that added to the depression. As far as I was concerned, this was my problem, I put myself there, now it was my responsibility to fix it. After researching on the internet, I discovered that Suboxone has a half-life of 24-48 hours. That means that each time i took a dose, it stayed in my system for give or take 4 days. That meant that the withdrawal and recovery process would also be longer than normal. Some reports I've read had said that after 4 months people were still feeling this way. I was terrified. But i thought to myself, I don't have a choice. I have to just deal with it. I didn't have any meds, no weed, no nothing to help cope with the symptoms. for 3 months, my life was:
1. Wake up feeling like I hadn't slept in days, back and neck are in immense amount of pain causing an incurable headache. 
2. No appetite, sneeze, runny nose, sneeze, stuffy nose. I feel like crying right now. 
3. I don't want to get up today, I don't want to talk to anyone, do anything, Im tired but I can't sleep
4. I am [REDACTED_NAME] people that I am [REDACTED_NAME] this from, I have to pretend to be normal. 
5. I am [REDACTED_NAME] out of my skin. It's an itch you can't scratch. Every minute feels like an hour. I can't wait until this is over. 

My family started to notice that I was tired all of the time. I had also lost weight. It was hard to hide the symptoms. My mother talked me into making a doctor's appointment which i went to, lied my ass off saying i didn't know why I had these symptoms, they took some blood tests and to my surprise ended up telling me that they thought I had a virus, so I was able to excuse my symptoms and behavior with that. Still, no one knew. As time went on, I slowly got better. I could fall asleep on melatonin instead of a mass dose of nyquil. I was trying to get out of the house more, but still depressed. I told myself that if I could just hang in there a little bit longer, I would feel normal again eventually. 
     Finally, after about 4 and a half months of slowly progressing out of withdrawal, I almost felt normal. During that time I did not crave or think about the suboxone other than for the fact that I could take my symptoms away for a couple days, but it wasn't like waking up thinking about a fix and going to bed thinking about a fix. 

     It has now been 4 years since then and I haven't touched the drug since. It scares me to death even thinking about it. I still think that the worst part of the whole thing was choosing to hide it, and not tell anyone what I was going through. I have learned tremendous amounts through this experience, The most important being that I need to use this knowledge and experience to help others. I made a one stupid decision not to educate myself on the dangers and effects of a drug that i became addicted to. I have since learned everything I could about drugs, but I do not currently take any drugs at all, nor did I ever try anything else of that nature. Reading and learning about drug culture fascinates me, even though I have absolutely no desire to actually do these drugs. I do smoke pot daily but it's legal here. I am [REDACTED_NAME] coming up on 2 years of marriage to my beautiful wife, we own a house and run a business.

If you take nothing else away from this, Please just remember this: DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!!!!!

If this could save even 1 person from the Misery and hell that I went through, than it is worth it to me. Sorry about the long story, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I was able to get that off my chest.

I feel like i have to get this full story off of my chest as it's been weighing me down for months and i just want it out there so people know, I'll give you from the beginning to end so if you can't be bothered to read it all I understand. Small synopsis, met a girl abroad, fell in love she went back to australia, I went back to Uk, I ended up going to australia and things were never the same and now I've got huge regrets anxiety and maybe even depression plus suicidal thoughts. This post may not sound serious at first but bear with it because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] high on valium at the moment and without it I just end up beating myself up and wanting to hurt myself.

Last year I was working in a place called Lagos in Portugal after recently completing the Camino De Santiago ( a giant walk across France and Spain). I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the keen and eager traveler and love life a lot. We ended up hitchhiking down through Portugal to Lagos and I got work in a bar. Now Lagos is quite the party place and while there I ended up sleeping with quite a few girls however I met one called Lucy towards the end of my time there and things just clicked. She came to work at the bar for one trial shift, we ended up getting super wasted (drink and mdma) and went to a club afterwards. Upon leaving the club I was like ""do you want to come back to mine and smoke some weed?"" (I knew I didn't have any weed) and she was super up for it, so we went back bought a load of munchies on the way, skittles, mars bars you name it. Anyway we got back to mine still pretty drunk and I walk over to the draw where the weed was supposedly kept and turn around like ""oh shit, there's none here, jake must of smoked it.... what do we do now?"" with that look in my eyes like 'shall we have sex eyes'. Next thing you know we're having drunken wild sex, hardly remember anything and wake up next to her thinking holy jesus she's beautiful. She looked at me different to how any girls looked at me in my entire life and I found out further down the line that she actually fell in love with me that first day. We had sex quite a few times that day, there were condoms and skittles all around my room and she even put a finger up my bum at one point (she was the first girl I ever let do this, I didn't enjoy it but at the same time at least I can say I've tried it). Anyhow after a wild sex filled day we left the apartment at like 16:00 and I bought her breakfast then I had to go off to work and she had to go back to her hostel to sleep. I couldn't stop thinking about her after she left and messaged her quite a few times on facebook to come round that night. At this point I knew i liked her but at the same time, and not to sound like an arrogant douchebag but I had been sleeping with a lot of girls there and it was hard for me to develop feelings for her as I was still in the mindset it was just a holiday fling.

She messaged me back saying ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about it, it will be fun, but i'm [REDACTED_NAME]'s just rally now what I was expecting to happen...I don't mean that I wanted to come  over here and sleep with every guy that try's but I mean that I didn't expect to meet someone where things clicked"". 
Now this was a huge eye opener to me, i was 23 years old at the time and had never had a relationship or met a girl who properly liked me in my life. Well maybe I had met girls who had liked me but I had never met a girl like this who was like things had clicked and was obviously looking further ahead. I was like, holy shit this beautiful ass girl who I have no idea how I even managed to coax into bed has actually developed feelings for me. This proper changed my whole perspective on everything and that night I got really drunk and all I wanted to do was see her. I ended up getting really drunk and heading round to the hostel where she was staying. I had no idea what room she was in so banged on various doors until the manager got up, got angry and pointed me to her room. She was shocked to see me, let me in and the room was a really low ceiling so I ended up hitting my head on the roof. It really hurt so I lay down, passed out and then woke up it was morning, she had shit to do and I pretty much got the feeling she wanted me to leave. So I left and was kind of gutted to be honest, I tried again the same night to go round and woke up the manager again who got real pissed off so I wasn't let in this time and that's when I was just like i give up. I thought she liked me but obviously had changed her mind so the next couple of nights i just went back to my old self of getting drunk and chatting up different girls. Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a pimp or anything but in that scenario where you work in a bar at a party place, picking up girls is fairly easy compred to real life and I managed to sleep with a different girl in the two following nights. However at 5 o clock in the morning the second night there's a ring at the doorbell. This was quite the common occurrence in my house as I lived with two other guys who partied hard and were always out until the early hours. So leaving the girl I just slept with in bed, I get up butt naked, wrap a sheet around me and go answer the door. Who do i find standing there other than Lucy.  She had been knocking on the wrong door for ages which was pretty funny but then asked one of my friends and eventually found my room in a drunken state. I was like, look you can't come in there was a big party here last night and everybody is asleep in the living room ( that was my bedroom at the time and now looking back that was such a shit unbelieveable excuse but still I'd rather say that than yeah there's this girl in my bed). So I said wait two seconds I'll get changed and come out for a walk. I went back into my room, left a note for the girl in bed saying I'd gone shopping for milk ( i'm [REDACTED_NAME] bad at excuses) and put some clothes on and went for a walk with Lucy. We walked down to the beach and sat together leaning up a palm tree and I remember she said, ' i think I really like you Jordan' and I looked at her and said ' I really like you too'. We spoke about various other things but that's really the only thing I remember, I walked her back to her hostel and went back to mine feeling so happy that for the first time in my life a girl had actually said that she likes me and meant it. i got back to my room and the girl I had slept with had gone so I got back in bed and fell asleep with a smile on my face. From then on for like a month Lucy came round pretty much everyday and we  had such a good time, it was pretty much just sex all the time we never really spoke much but it just worked and things just clicked. I still don't think i loved her at this point but there was definately something there.

Towards the end of the trip I fell over and cracked my head open in a drunken state and Lucy ( who was supposed to be going to some wild party that night) instead came round and looked after me. She got cream, washed the blood off of me and cleaned my cut and we spent the next 4 days lying in bed together and watching David Attenborough documentaries. This is when I properly thought this girl is special. However I still refused to let myself get attached to her as I thought it would be just a holiday fling and that it was pointless getting attached. She had to leave pretty soon so I decided I was going to leave too as I really had no interest in being there after she had gone. We had one last big night, got super wasted which ended up with me passing out in a sink then I got up and went to say goodbye to her as she got on a coach to go to Lisbon. ( I gave her a bottle of blue powerade as a gift to say bye, this was kind of our thing).

Anyway she left to Lisbon and the following day or night ( I can't remember) I went home for a day then onto Oktoberfest. Another party place. As soon as Lucy had left though, all I could think bout was her. We spoke pretty much every single day on facebook and this is when I really got to know her as a person. We skyped sometimes for like 5 hours and just basically had a great relationship. It wasn't like a long distance relationship as we both were sleeping with other people but we knew something was there. The first time we spoke on skype was in germany and I actually broke down in tears and couldn't even explain why, I just missed her so much but still i was telling myself I didn't love her.

A few months pass and Oktoberfest is over, me and lucy have returned to our normal lives but yet we still skype pretty much every week and talk on facebook every day. I'd wake up in the morning looking forward to reading her messages then couldn't wait until the night to talk to her again (Australian and uk timezones are pretty fucked up). Anyway it worked out. However this is where I made my first proper mistake.

Now like I said, I have a hard time believing girls generally like me, I don't know why i just do. Maybe it's a self esteem issue I don't know but in the past every time i truly liked a girl I always got knocked back, so it was hard for me to believe Lucy generally liked me. My original plan was to save up over winter and go to Australia but I had various other friends asking me to do other things and to be honest they were tempting. I was still talking to Lucy quite regularly and she had her hopes up that i would be coming to Australia shortly, but my friends had asked me to go and do a ski season in France which I was really tempted by and I spoke to lucy about it and she was like yeah you should do it if that's what you want. She was actually putting a brave face on like the amazing girl she is, when I said I was going to France this actually made her so upset that she had to have the day off work. I didn't know about any of this. As soon as I told her I was going to France my mind went into the mode like have I made the right decision here and over the course of a day, I think it might of been my birthday, I went through so many mind changes but then spoke to Lucy about it. She was honest with me and said that when I told her I was going to France it actually really upset her. This broke me, I was like here I am [REDACTED_NAME] a beautiful girl across the world who wants me to come over and see her and instead I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to upset her by going to France and just partying again like i did in the Summer. So I changed my mind I said something chessy like ' I've thought about it, and instead of going to france I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to come to Australia, I just can't bear to go another 6 months without seeing you' . She was super happy again but at this point she had already cried her tears for me and begun to try to get over me so the feeling of love she had for me had changed. however this was the opposite with me, as soon as I had commited to Australia I practically began obsessing with her. Hanging on every message she sent, wondering why it took her so long to reply sometimes just being that general weirdo in your own head. I knew I was worrying over nothing but at the same time something was telling me I really like this girl, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to fly across the world to her and she's not going to like me as much as i like her. I was nevervous, anxious and didn't really sleep well the few nights before flying. I never told my Mom and Dad about her as if it didn't work out I didn't want them to know really. However I flew there, she met me at the airport and was in tears when she saw me which was nice, we went back to hers had great sex then had lasagne for dinner. (Lasagnes like my favourite and she made it especially for my arrival :)) 

For the first month things were pretty good however like any holiday romance things were never really the same. The first week i had serious jetlag and just wanted to cuddle her when I couldn't sleep however she just got annoyed with me because she can't sleep when someones touching her ( this wasn't the case in Lagos so this confused me). I'm a very affectionate person so with the combination of not sleeping, lack of affection from a person you flew across the world to see and just generally being in a random place not really having any mates i think is how I first began to develop anxiety. I met one of her best friends Hannah in one of the first two weeks and got really drunk on jaeger at lucys place. I don't know what happened but me and lucy argued over something because I was really drunk and I remember having a drunken flashback to thinking ' oh fuck, I've fucked everything up with her, i HAVE TO KILL MYSELf'. i woke up in her bed the next day obviously not dead but she wasn't there and I spoke to hannah and she said we argued and that I should speak to lucy and apologise. She said she had never saw me like that and that i had scared her, this made me sad so I cut down on my drinking quite a lot. The following month went good, I met her two roommates and they all liked me enough to ask me to move in. I was originally going to find my own place but I thought things are going well I might aswell stay here. People had warned me and her about moving in too soon but we both thought it was fine. That was until towards like the end of the second month. I'd been through a bit of a shit period, I'd left a waiting job to get a Graphic Design job which I ended up hating, I'd gone through the stress of buying a new car and I had generally just been acting quite panicky and rushed compared to how i normally am. I remember physically shaking when I was going to buy the car and was rushing around for money and different things not really thinking straight. I had also had my first proper panic attack i think when it came to making a meal for lucy. I was trying to be a perfectionist, the perfect boyfriend, putting a shit load of pressure on myself to get things right and beating myself up a lot if I said or did something she didn't like instead of just being like the cool easy going guy I was in Lagos, I had began hanging on every word she said. I planned Valentines meticulously and that went great to be honest but apart from that I was always putting a huge amount of pressure on myself to be the best boyfriend ever. Towards the end of the second month I had left the design job, got a bricklayers labourer job which I got fired from then managed to get another job doing the same thing but for more money and closer to home. Things were looking up for me but at the same time me and lucy felt weird, we weren't having sex that often at all, not Like Lagos. It was maybe once a week if I was lucky. I wanted to have sex all the time but she told me Lagos was different and she's just not that sort of sexual person in Australia. I decided to just deal with it, she meant to much to me so I was willing to deal with the no cuddles and lack of sex and just wanted to be there for her. I didn't realise this was actually taking it's toll on me mentally. We were showering together one day and the thought just crossed my mind that we hadn't been having sex and that something was up so I just asked ' do you want me to move out?' and she was like ' I don't know, maybe?'. This broke me, I don't know why but it brought me back to the first time I truly liked a girl and she knocked me back. I felt like I had to run away but I didn't, I just got really sad and then told her I loved her, which looking back was a bit stupid, even though I did love her I kind of didn't want to tell her until I knew it was right. 

Anyway, we got past that, things were a bit weird but I ended up finding a mates to move into ( happened to be a drug dealer) and we moved on from there. She'd come round occasionally and watch a movie and have dinner and i'd do the same round hers, things were nice. I still hadn't really managed to establish myself in Australia though as i didn't really have a group of friends I hung around with, I was always relying on Lucy to do something. I was also getting real itchy feet to travel and see the country which is what I imagined we would do, ( I would complain quite a lot that I wanted to get out of Melbourne and see the country). We went on little daytrips that were nice but our relationship wasn't exactly going fantastic, the spark had kind of gone and we weren't really having sex at all. I loved her hugely but didn't think she felt the same and she didn't but we never really brought it up. I think she didn't want to say anything at the risk of breaking my heart. one thing I have failed to mention also is that we still used to party, quite a bit. We'd go to various clubs and bars and get drunk and take mdma quite often, the drug of choice over in australia. I dabbled with drugs in Lagos a lot but never really felt any ill effects. The combination of drugs in australia that increase serotonin then dump it massively combined with a relationship where I felt I wasn't good enough and the stress of constantly finding a new place to live and working a  job i didn't really enjoy all kind of culminated in increased anxiety and eventually led me to have a breakdown in tears in her car. (I'd been waking up quite regularly shaking, having trouble sleeping, not wanting to go to work, worrying constantly about things i had no control over like does lucy still like me, and whats going to happen about my tax and the governments out to get me). So the breakdown happened, we decided i should see a psychologist and try and get my shit together.

Side note: In regards to the drugs, a lot of people are going to think yeah you did this to yourself and have no symptahy. And yeah they probably played a part in it, but to be honest it was never the drugs I was addicted to. it was th way me and Lucy were when we were both on drugs. It took me back to Lagos, she said things to me like ""you're amazing"", ""whatever happens lets always be friends"" and she was just the wild sexual girl i remember. We even had sex in the toilets of a nightclub at one point and this as dirty as it sounds actually turned me on massively, this was what i wanted all the time. So whenever we went out, if she was taking drugs I'd want them too so we could feel that connection however sometimes she would push me away and that would affect me more. Plus the comedowns really had started to take their toll on me and I just couldn't do it anymore.

I started seeing the psychologist and explained a lot of my issues with work, anxiety, moving country having a new relationship that wasn't exactly going as well as I imagined and we worked on various techniques for a few weeks. During this time we went to a house party and after a 30 day break on drugs, I got really drunk, smoked some weed and took some MD and Lucy saw me. She broke down in tears, this was the first time in ages that I realized she actually cared about me. I apologised and she called me an idiot for doing those things to me because i knew they weren't good for me. She was so sad and I couldn't make her happy and this killed me. She stopped crying eventually and we spoke and I called her a cab home and I got a cab back to my place. I was up all night feeling like I'd ruined everything between us and being an idiot for not beleiving she cared about me. At 3:00 in the afternoon I still hadn't slept but we spoke and I ended up around hers where she was throwing up from drunkness the night before. I gave her a rub on the back and stayed with her all day while she was sick then got some much needed sleep while i cuddled her. It was as much for me as it was for her. 

After that I found a new place to live with a guy called Russell, staying in a pretty big house with two dogs and a friend from work. It was a nice place but me and Lucy still weren't the best. i was convinced she should break up with me, that other boys were better for her than me and all other sorts of stupid shit. ( I really have stupid mood swings, sometimes everythings great, sometimes it's the end of the world). Everytime she mentioned going out and doing drugs i just thought I can't be that guy anymore she wants me to be, and just basically beat myself up into not thinking i was good enough for her. on top of that the psychologist i had been seeing had been telling me he felt I secretly wanted to break up with her, quit my job and go travel. Well the plan turned out that i was going to quit my job, I had stopped enjoying it and to be honest felt like i was breaking the law due to being classed as running my own business even though I worked for someone ( my emplyer made me do this to get paid). So I quit my job and felt super happy,  Lucy asked me to go to a gathering with her and her friends and i was like ok I'll drive so i don't drink. Went to the gathering and things were nice, I felt like a bit of a tag along still because they were all her mates but oh well, also I still hadn't found my own proper group of mates but this was something I was trying to work on. On the drive home, I went through a speeding camera and this really pissed me off. it was the second time i had done that and i was so angry with myself I just wanted to hit myself but Lucy hates it when I get angry so I tried my best to keep it in. i dropped her friends off then we got back to hers and we sat down and spoke. We hadn't had sex for like 3 weeks, we just felt weird and i just asked her what she thought was happening to us. She broke down in tears and i knew that we were gonna breakup. I broke down in tears too and knew it was over. We spoke about lots of stuff, and left on realy good terms but the next day and following 5 days I was so low and depressed (not suicidal just low). I'd been acting pretty crazy too, not able to make my mind up about whether to stay or leave Melbourne, not able to force myself to make a decision. This whole time in Australia I'd been skyping my Parents and they were worried about me too, my anxiety had really been affecting me the last few months and they didn't think I was having a very good time. Anyway, me and Lucy met up a few days later and spoke things through, it was heart breaking. She told me she had fell in love with me in lagos but when i said I was going to france her feelings were never the same. I regret that but at the same time never knew how she felt. We cried, went out for a meal as a last goodbye thing then we went back to mine. I wanted her to come in, she didn't think it was a good idea and I kind of agreed, I just didn't want to let go. I went inside, and had been thinking of leaving to go Sydney but just couldn't bring myself to do it at that point. Following morning I packed all of my shit in my car and left without really saying goodbye to anyone. I had had the opportunity to sell my car too instead as i felt it would lead to problems down the line but I just needed to escape. I went to pick up this girl i met online who wanted a rideshare but i was just so shaky and nervous that I had to drop her off and say I didn't feel safe driving her so decided to head up to sydney on my own. I drove from 5:30 in the morning until 21:00 the same night and it felt pretty great. I managed to crash with a girl and a family who I met abroad travelling and they were super kind a sweet to me. 

I was very low the night after getting there and told Lolly the girl i was staying with what I'd been going through, I also went to the doctors and was prescribed Citalopram which I think has made me pretty crazy to be honest. It's an antidepressant which makes you worse before you get better. I didn't even know if i was depressed or not i was just panicked. I'd go for walks on my own listening to sad songs with tears in my eyes and i just couldn't stop thinking about her, looking back I suppose this is pretty normal for an initial relationship breakup but it's my frist so gimme a break. I'd been practicing meditation and stuff which helped and i felt like I was slowly getting over her but after they upped my dose of citalopram things took even more of a shit turn. So when i arrived in Sydney i'd been crashing at this familys house, was nice having a place to chill and that but I kind of just hung around. I got to see Sydney for the first few days and then got a little side job but still was pretty down. I had a few day where i felt great but then they went away and i was on a downer, after upping my citalopram I was really weird. Getting really panicky when driving places, was trying to sell my car and stuff but couldn't think rationally or bring myself to do the things i need to do in order to sell it. Also my friend was asking me to drive up the coast with him to do some agricultural work ( if you do this in australia you can get your visa extended by one year ) and also to add to this Lucy had just arrived in Sydney to meet her sister and we had been texting about meeting up. Now all these things were normal and seemed like things I could handle however I'd been panicking, my Mom and Dad had been telling me to come home, everyone around me saying go home, the doctors saying go home and so instead of meeting up with lucy, or going to do my farmwork. I panicked, booked a flight home via China and got on a plane the same day. As soon as I arrived at the airport and my bag went away on the conveyor belt I knew i'd fucked up. I should of just saw Lucy, then gone and did my farmwork for 3 months while getting a psychologist sorted and selling my car during that period. However instead I've paid 1500$ to go on a flight home via China on the most depressing plane trip every. I got on the plane feeling mega out of it, couldn't really concentrate stressing out. Went to the toilet about 50 times to piss and would look at myself in the mirror and punch myself for being such an idiot. It was like I figured out the solution to all of my problems over there but by that time i was already on a plane ride home via fucking china and now I was fucked. Arrived in China, and what do I see, a flight back to Sydney. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] holy shit i could totally go back! Turns out there was no seats on the plane and to be honest my suitcase was on the other plane going back to the UK so I would of returned to sydney 1500$ down with no stuff either. So I tried to make the sensible option and go home.

Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME], when I landed after no sleep I actually felt alright, I saw the family went for a run and generally just chilled out. I went to sleep at the night for about an hour then began the freakouts and thoughts of killing myself. Apparently Citalopram can cause these thoughts, a few of my friends who have been on them have had the same thing but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] like how stupid is it that an antidepressant can cause suicidal thoughts / tendancies. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a suicidal person, I know there's so much i want to do in my life but all the mistakes i've made make me want to hurt myself too and it's really frustrating. Like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] some sort on consience battle. I'll cross the road and see a truck and think I could easily jump in front of that etc. I've spoke to my family about it and i got doctors coming out to see me quite often. The thing that pisses me off the mot is the fact I didn't have the balls to go and see Lucy again while she was in Sydney and wanted to see me, we ended it on good terms but I just freaked out. Anyhow now we come to this point, where I've took a valium but only slept 3 hours and instead spent the last 4 hours writing up a 5000 word essay as my first post on Reddit. Anyhow yeah, I don't know what I want you guys to say or even if i expect you to read any of this shit at all but yeah it's off my chest now and here and I can come back to it and add stuff.

In regards to suicide, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to do it. There's too much for me to live for, it's just I ran away from a lot of problems in Australia and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of myself for doing that, i should of been able to man up and deal with them while I was there but I just obviously haven't been thinking straight and just want to get my head back to how it used to be. I have these thoughts of hurting myself but am convinced it's the meds which is why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to get the docs to sort it out! My ultimate aim is to fix all of my problems I've left there but for now I need to rest. I've wrote this all from what I remember happening and there's probably somethings i missed out but yeah I Think this post went a bit manic at the end so I'll end it here and try get back to sleep, if any of you guys do end up reading this, well done! Hope it brought some entertainment to your day. Look forward to hearing what you got to say! Any views / advice / opinions appreciated. I want to fix all the shit I've done wrong. I've left a car there, fucked things up with the first love of my life, missed the opportunity to do farmwork with a friend, am $1500 down and need to fix this! Also apologies for the bad grammar, I've been writing this the last 4 hours and am pretty wired with no sleep, goodnight.",2
3c9t1c,1436160965.0,2015-07-06 05:36:05,offmychest,My story of emotional abuse and my struggle to forgive and forget,"A year ago, I was pretty naive and unsure of what I was doing in terms of relationships.  I came across this guy who I will refer to as Carlos for the sake of anonymity.  When we first met, we mostly chatted on Facebook.  Initially, I was fascinated with him.  He seemed like a nice guy.  He also seemed Bohemian, artistic, open-minded, ambitious, and very peaceful.  The downsides?  He was/is an illegal immigrant from Mexico and he was eight years older than me.  I met him when I was 18 and he was 26. 

Shortly after, we started dating.  Initially, I told him I didn't really want a serious relationship, but he beckoned me into it.  At the time, I was a pretty casual person and didn't mind a fling here and there.  He, on the other hand, wanted more.  The first time we got together for a date was also the first time I slept with him.  Thinking about it, the situation was really stupid.  For all I know, I could have been killed that night in a hotel room half an hour away from the college campus I lived at.  I don't think ""foolish"" even amounts to how bad of a decision that could have been.  Regardless, it happened and the next day at lunch, he started to talk seriously.  I was casually playing a game on my phone at the time when he took it out of my hands, put it facedown on the table, and showed me pictures from his life.  At the time, I passed it off as ""a little rude"" but ""shame on me for playing on my phone at a lunch date.""  He then said he expected loyalty from me.  I told him I wasn't looking for a serious relationship.  He repeated himself again.  I don't remember much after that but I know now his behavior should have been a red flag right then and there for his rude insistence.  I'll emphasize again: I was pretty stupid.

A few weeks later, I ended up dating him.  Things seemed fine.  For the most part, he was artsy and really sweet.  Then, after about a month, things started to go downhill.  All of a sudden, he wasn't so sweet anymore.  If anything, he had an insistence for things to go his way - whether or not it was an inconvenience for me.  On top of that, I noticed he talked too much - especially about himself and his accomplishments - like how far he had come from being a beggar on the street to now having a job, his own lawn care business, and goes to college.  I think I heard that story way too many times.  

But, what started to occur that was really distressful was his urge to get control of me.  For instance, the first time we fought was on the phone over birth control.  Mr. Pursuit-of-Knowledge himself didn't quite understand biology.  I was and still am a pharmacy major and had just finished and passed intensive biology and chemistry courses.  Nonetheless, he insisted birth control was another drug that was bad and can lead to addiction and wanted me off of it.  I refused and tried to educate him about how birth control works and how it doesn't harm me at all.  Then, he started screaming at me about how birth control was like crack cocaine and how it'll ruin me.  I ended up crying and he threatened to break up with me unless I stopped my birth control.  I told him I would do it to get him to stop yelling at me and because I didn't want to lose him.  I thought I must have done something wrong to anger him because it never happened before.  Something I did just HAD to have set him off because he never yells.  Ever.  

Well, I didn't discontinue it.  I told him my parents wouldn't let me stop taking birth control and I didn't want to make them angry.  This was partially true.  The other part was that I didn't want to come off of it because he didn't like using condoms.  Oh, speaking of which, the sex?  Looking back on it, he had an insistence that every time we did it, we were ""making love.""  Not ""fucking"", not ""banging"", not even ""sex"", but ""making love.""  Because of him, to this day, I despise that term.  His version of ""making love"" was not on par with its definition.  It seemed to me like raw sex, rougher than any other partner I had been with.  The guy had no real sense of what it meant to be gentle.  Quite a few times, I have bled from the occasion of him being too rough.  Why did I continue screwing this guy, you may ask?  Because I thought eventually I would get used to it and my body would adjust.  Again, I still wanted to believe this person was still the nice Bohemian man trying to live a good and peaceful life.

I was with this horrible person for four months.  Do I sound like a bitter ex girlfriend?  Because I definitely am.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] as hell that I wasted so much time and energy with this monster.  For the duration of last summer, he fought with me on any topic he could find an excuse to fight me with.  Defending myself was out of the question even when I tried to keep things calm.  He would still resort to screaming and cursing at me if I didn't agree with him.  And crying wouldn't get him to stop.  Instead, he'd scream even more.

""Stop fucking crying!"" He would yell, ""What the fuck are you crying  for, huh?""  

Whether in person having an argument with him in his vehicle or on the phone, this moment would have me sobbing with my head in between my knees or buried in my hands begging for him to stop yelling at me.  I had to beg to get him to comfort me.  Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.  But if I acted cold afterwards, it would then be his turn to beg - like all of a sudden he was a victim.  He would never truly apologize for his actions, but rather remind me how much he loved me and wanted me to be strong and knew I was still young but he would help me grow.  And it would somehow work almost every time.

The guilt tripping was like a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card for him.  Every time I would try to break up with him, he would rapidly send pictures of us together, reminding me of how happy we were, he would promise to be the Sweet Carlos I fell in love with, and he would tell me how much he loved me, wanted to marry me as soon as I graduated, had big plans for our life together, was crying so much and so much more.  At some point, I don't know if I stayed with him because I wanted to change him, felt sorry for him, or because I was afraid of him.  I've felt all three at some point in the relationship.

He also hated some of my hobbies too.  For instance, I love video games.  I always have.  Him?  He hated video games.  If I was playing a game and he called me, he would get angry if I try to have a conversation with him and play at the same time.  One time, on my birthday, I invited him over to my dorm room where some friends and I hung out to play games together.  Instead of participating with us, he played on his phone the entire time.  Sometimes, he would use that hobby against me in arguments to demonstrate how lazy I was compared to his hardworking self who gardened and mowed lawns for a living.  Did it ever occur to him that I was still a college student with only a part time job?

But what he hated more than that were the people I interacted with.  He hated my father for not approving of him because he's an illegal immigrant.  He said my father was an ignorant racist for not sympathizing with his situation.  Keep in mind, my father is married to my mother who's an immigrant from the Philippines.  He worked hard to bring her and my grandmother here into the country legally.  In my dad's eyes, Carlos had no excuse not to wait in line like everyone else.  Carlos, on the other hand, couldn't wait to sweep me away from my family and have me all to himself.

But more so, Carlos hated any male I interacted with: whether it be a childhood friend, a college friend, a coworker, or even my manager: he was always - ALWAYS - extremely jealous.  If I simply talked to a guy friend and mentioned it later, he had to know what we talked about and would get angry that we talked in the first place.  To him, every male figure was trying to get into my pants or steal me away.  To him, I was a potential cheater.  And no matter how many times I would reassure him that I would not cheat on him, he was always suspicious of me - for even the littlest of things like browsing Facebook late at night or listening to the same music my coworkers would listen to (it didn't matter I had that Reggaeton playlist on Spotify years before I met him - I was still ""influenced"" by the Central American guys at work who were trying to ""hit on me"").

In general, I felt trapped with him - tied down in a relationship I didn't want to be involved with in the first place.  And he would continue to use personal things I told him against me.  That thing about cheating?  Well before him, I cheated on my last boyfriend.  I stayed single for a while because I felt like I needed a lot of time before getting into another relationship.  On top of that, I felt extremely guilty for what I had done.  My last boyfriend may have pushed me away on many levels, but at least he wasn't unfaithful (to my knowledge) and I hurt him and destroyed whatever was left of our relationship.  So, when Carlos used the fact I cheated on my last boyfriend against me as a reason why I am [REDACTED_NAME] allowed to interact with any men...I felt like I deserved it as punishment for my vile sin.  In a way, staying with Carlos was like a punishment I deserved for what I did to my last boyfriend.  Who was I to complain about a bad guy when quite frankly, I wasn't a good person to begin with?  I had started to accept my fate.

I had two wake-up calls that had me reconsidering the relationship.

The first was during sex.  At this time, we were in a hotel room and he was performing oral sex on me to try to get me to climax.  I just happen to be a difficult person when it comes to climaxing thanks to other people.  Solo, I do just fine.  Others, however, have to learn and adjust to my body to satisfy me.  I didn't choose it.  It's how I am.  However, after ten minutes and still no result, he threw my legs aside and started yelling at me for not coming.  I didn't know what to do.  There I was, naked and vulnerable before him, and he wanted to hurt me emotionally right then and there because my inability to climax with him was somehow my fault.  I remember how he put his hands on his hips, looked distastefully at my genitals, then demanded I show him how I ""do myself.""  I refused and I started crying, going back to fetal position once again, and wanting to know why he was acting like this.  After a minute or two, I got off the bed and tried to put my clothes on.  He came over and yanked them away from me.

""Stop!  I don't want it."" I told him.

His reply?  ""I'll make you want it.""  He then threw me onto the bed and started performing oral sex on me again.  Initially, I tried to struggle but then I gave up.  After a few minutes, he stopped, admitting he spoiled it and left it at that.  He never truly apologized. 

 Later that night, I tried to talk with him about the incident on the phone.  He wouldn't discuss it.  Instead, he got angry at me for bringing up something already done and over with and wanted to get a good night's sleep.  This was the first and only time I ever said, ""Fuck you, Carlos."" before hanging up on him.  Later on, he would text me that I crossed the line.  Then, he called me with his voice thundering once more at how I was wrong in the first place and how I ""fucked up his night.""  This would be the first time I relished his anger.  But despite that, he always wanted the last word.  After he hung up, I had a breakdown.  I wanted answers.  I wanted to know why he treated me the way he did earlier.  I didn't give two shits about his beauty sleep because too many nights he had left me restless.  He refused to answer and texted me that he was going to sleep whether I liked it or not.  I remember asking how can sleep like nothing happened.  His answer:

""Because I am [REDACTED_NAME] peace.  There is nothing that disturbs me right now.""

It was like a shameful mockery of the peaceful man I thought he was, slammed into my face in the wake of an admission he would never feel sorry for how he treated me.  No amount of making me cry or making me suffer at night would faze him.  Because somehow he felt perfectly fine treating me like he owned me.  That's when I really became afraid of him.  How was I supposed to marry this guy?  If this is how he treats me now, how would I be treated if he was legally entitled to me?  It's safe to say that for the last month, I had already broken up with him in my head and was finding ways to do the same in real life.

The second incident occurred in a restaurant he invited me out to lunch to.  Considering the date was his idea, I thought he would pay.  However, he said our check would be separate because he's having financial issues.  This annoyed me but I took a moment to check my bank account to make sure I had enough funds and then decided to treat myself with a nice lunch.  He somehow saw the amount I had in my savings and was surprised I had $600 saved up.  I shrugged it off and admitted I did because I regularly save at least %75 of my paycheck every time I get one.  Keep in mind, this was done over the whole summer with one job and then another - both part time and both just about minimum wage.  

Then, he insisted I pay for both of us.  Why?  Because I had the money to do so.  I refused, explaining I was only paid $60 because I didn't work a lot of hours the past two weeks and I needed to save the rest of my money.  He then criticized me for not being considerate to his situation.  When we got our meals, I tried to change the subject, but he remained cold to me throughout the entire meal.  It didn't matter that he had two jobs and was paid more than me.  He had more to pay for like gas, bills, and college.  To him, I was a spoiled middle class girl who could afford to spend half her paycheck on a meal he invited me out to.  So, the pressure continued until I eventually gave in and payed $30 for both of us.  It was then that he started being sweet to me all of a sudden, without saying as much of a thank you.  Just another, ""I love you, cosita.""  

I stormed out of the restaurant and he followed me, asking about my attitude.  I raged at him, telling him that pressuring me to pay for him was unnecessary and rude and that he should never do that to me.  He laughed it off like I was joking.  This infuriated me more and I told him he was selfish and I was sick of him using me.  He then turned serious and said, ""Oh, it's always about money with you!  You American people are so obsessed with it!  Take your fucking money!""  He opened his wallet - full of cash - and tried to toss $40 at me.  I refused it because the damage was already done.  He had manipulated me and that was the issue - not money. 

That night, I finally broke up with him for good.  It took advice from my parents to really push me to do it, but they told me that there are way better men out there who would treat me better.  My father suspected he was trying to get at our family's money and the incident at the restaurant only confirmed his beliefs.  

And how he raged.  First, Carlos was cold and angry.  Then, anger turned into hateful - calling me a heartless ""b----"" in the process and hoping I would wake up someday and realize my mistake.  Unfortunately for him, my only mistake was dating him in the first place.  After enough insults, I blocked him on my phone and on Facebook.  However, he had another Facebook account linked to his Lawn Care company that he used to continue messaging me the next day - begging me back, telling me how much he loved me, how he doesn't understand why I had to break his heart like this, etc.  And let's not forget the pictures he sent of us together or him crying.  He was so pathetic I almost felt sorry for him.  He wanted to know so bad what he did to make me leave him so I gave him a good hard list of all he had done to hurt me.  His answer?  There wasn't any.  He kept trying to change the subject.  The man was a coward and too prideful to admit he was wrong.  The issue was never him, but more along the lines of me being too young to understand his ""good intentions"" or me not appreciative of his ""love"" or other bullshit.  I blocked him for good after.  Then, I was able to make my way back to my university to start a new year and hopefully, a new beginning.  My friends were very supportive and understanding of what I had just gone through.  

A few months later, he managed to message me on WhatsApp after I set up an account to talk with a friend.  He talked about how he was still in love with me and how I was a true woman who straightened him out.  Still no apology.  I ignored it as I was dating another guy at the time and had no interest in even addressing my ex.

Fast forward another month and he surprises me by showing up to my workplace in my hometown.  I don't even address him.  Instead, I hide in the back room until he leaves and I call my father and my current boyfriend for support.  My father came to escort me back home to make sure my ex didn't follow me.  My current boyfriend helped me calm down and reassured me that things will be okay.

A couple weeks later and he messages me on Facebook.  I had unblocked him for the intention of sending him a warning that I would file a restraining order if he didn't leave me alone but never got around to it.  It was on New Years day and he said, ""Hope 2015 is better than 2014 for all it's worth.""  At this time, I was with my current boyfriend in a big city enjoying the celebration.  I didn't respond and yet I didn't send a warning.  He was only wishing a happy new year so there wasn't much harm. 

Two weeks after that, he sent pictures of an art piece he worked on ""in my honor"" of this Japanese woman with a pastel background.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Japanese.  And I don't see how that was in my honor in any way.  Either way, I was fed up with his messages and my current boyfriend noticed it too.  

Eventually I mustered the strength to write him a warning.  Either he leave me alone or I take legal action.  I wrote especially, ""Considering the status of your lack of citizenship, I wouldn't push this boundary any further if I were you."" 
I sent it through Facebook and blocked him forever more.  I did this with the help of my best friend and my current boyfriend.  At the moment, I felt relieved and at the same time, free.

But now, I still struggle to this day with forgetting my abusive ex.  Emotional abuse isn't always taken seriously, but many scars are left behind and my experience was traumatizing.  There are still moments where I have flashbacks of last year and I just feel all this rage within me.  I have also had to deal with issues of insecurity.  Luckily, my current boyfriend has been and still is wonderful to me.  He has helped me heal and has shown me what true love really is.  

But how can I let go of all this hatred I have for my ex?  He's gone but I feel there wasn't enough justice done.  Part of me truly wants him to suffer like I did, part of me wants him deported, and the darkest part of me wouldn't care if he was dead.  I feel so happy in my current relationship but I can't forget my ex abuser.  The memories still haunt me to this day and all I feel is the pure hatred I have towards him for hurting me and ultimately turning me into a much darker person than I used to be.  I used to be carefree and hopeful for a fairy tale relationship.  That monster took my hopes and trapped me in a relationship that would scar me with trust issues, insecurity, prejudice for illegal immigrants, and cynicism.  

I want to let it all go, and maybe I want to find it in myself to forgive him.  But I can't.  I just can't.  How do I fix this?

Tl;dr:  Story of ex abuser and it's been a year and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a very good person now.  It' just that I struggle to forgive and forget the experience altogether.

I have to admit though.  Writing this out helped a lot.",1
1i9qjl,1373796990.0,2013-07-14 10:16:30,offmychest,"I'm judgmental, discriminating, cold and I'm going to die alone rather than change. Enjoy my story of worthlessness.","Everyone seems to be able to lead healthy, successful lives while choosing dates and partners they're attracted to, but being nice to those with less fortunate looks who are probably lonely and desperate, **far more than me.**

In my school days I was always a bit awkward around girls and over the last couple of years I started to understand why: I was always worried that if I'd be too nice to the girls I was not attracted to, **and I wanted to be nice to them**, I could end up finding them so interesting and attractive that I'd date them. In other words, not be a **shallow dick**. That said, many of them had a lack of confidence which made them even less attractive, which is sad and understandable, but I don't fault myself for not being able to see past that then. It takes maturity to be able to see the *potential* in someone. Nevertheless, I was so averse to the thought of being physical with them and I didn't know how to deal with that conflict in me.

What are the obvious culprits. I never had a good relationship with my mother. *She* never had a good relationship with her father. He, by the way, molested my sister who has borderline personality disorder and became a heroin addict which, in turn, lead to her getting raped. My mother was bulimic and divorced my gay father when I was about 3 years young. I love it.

At age 12 or younger I started viewing porn. Lightly at first, however, already with a curiosity for pierced vaginas, my first perversion. Over the years my porn use *gradually* increased and I found more and more enjoyment in it. It was even a bit of a substitute for my deprived social life, because I remember idealizing certain porn stars and certain ""aesthetics"". It was more than an escape or addiction.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to quit porn now, 10 years later. It's over.

Ever since around 12 years old I was cruelly abusive towards cats. This is my biggest burden. There is zero sympathy or understanding for perpetrators of abuse, still I think it's **necessary** for me to be able to confess that to someone in order to find reconciliation. But confessing it is hard when the response would likely be ""so why do you think you tortured your cats?"" or ""do you feel shame and guilt for what you did?"". HOW CAN I NOT!? As they continue to sit in their chair, ostensibly caring and understanding, but not facilitating the emotional repairing that I need. **I don't want to talk about it because it's terrible.** ^((Clarification: The reason I want to confess is so that I can be forgiven, and so that somebody *understands* that I have this guilt in the first place. I don't want to talk about the abuse itself!)^) I don't minimize the seriousness of my crime. I wish I could offer my insight in a useful context, but much more than that, I wish this wasn't even a part of me. **I don't want to be ‘Paul the heartless monster’.**

In somewhat of a ""miracle"" I forced myself to stop abusing my last cat. It didn't make me feel any better, but, I suppose, it made my cat feel a lot better and enjoy his life. I took a little bit, just a little bit of happiness from that. Although I wish I could have been a better father, shown genuine affection, stopping the abuse was all I could do. Fortunately, he's with a better family now and from what I hear he's doing great, he's absolutely charming, and... gentle.

Getting back to my original point, as I stopped abusing my cat I started researching about mental, neurological and personality disorders in the hopes that I would find something that described me so that I could seek the right treatment. I looked at many different disorders and checked symptoms. Often I found a handful of symptoms that matched up witch what I was thinking and feeling, but not enough that I would think I had a given illness. I'm a critical thinker and I made sure, as best as I could, that I thoroughly understood the symptoms and the nature of a given illness. I tried to account for different interpretations due to our somewhat subjective use of language (stemming from the fact that we have subjective experiences in general, and that those affect how we learn a language and to which emotions and underlying concepts we relate words with. It's all very vague of course and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to sound smart. Language and meaning evolves in a very fluid way, much like culture, and the world as a whole). The one personality disorder I felt was the most consistent with my experiences was psychopathy/ASPD and narcissism and it really worried me. My concern was that I might be on the path to becoming a sick, conscienceless murderer or worse. Anyway, what I wanted to get at is that I did *a lot* of reflecting during that time and for the first time in my life I actually tried to **understand myself**. A big part of that was trying to understand others, too, because that's obviously central to being human and to how I relate to others and *through others* back to myself. I started to compulsively ""self talk"", meaning that I simulated interactions with other people and while doing so analyze body language, eye contact, use of emphasis and pauses in speech, the role of sarcasm, conversation patterns, control of emotions and what makes someone an ""alpha"" person, etc. I tried to understand my **self-image** during all of this, too. Over time I simply developed a better understanding of my own emotions and my thought patterns and how they change, ""metacognition"" if you want to call it that. Finally, I philosophized and hypothesized about the universe, time, consciousness, death, and so on, which gave me some interesting insights... but which seem utterly and disappointingly useless now.

Nobody is probably reading this anymore so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to finish up.

After that period of change I felt like I could be anyone I wanted to be, in a sense. However, I was still worried that my conscience and my newfound understanding could disappear again and I could become abusive and out-of-control again. Furthermore, I still hadn't achieved anything in life, was still a boring person, and I could barely express my profound thoughts to another person. (I guess that's simply because there are more pressing issues in this world and most people haven't had the luxury to think so deeply about life, which is also kind of a solitary pursuit that doesn't lend itself well to conversation). By the way, I know I sound like a really disgusting self-declared ivory tower intellectual, especially when I say things like ""most people haven't had the luxury to think so deeply about life"". Pointing it out probably doesn't help either. ^((being so meta also doesn't)^) The truth is I don't want to be this way. I don't want to write this shit anymore but I feel like I have to. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going in fucking circles when deciding what to write and how to write it and I end up just spewing everything out, perhaps to avoid not writing anything and figuring I should just close this window, because then I couldn't pretend that someone was reading about me, which would make me feel even more isolated.

I just want to get back to my original point and finish this quickly. One of the things I realized was that I used to be very prejudiced and discriminating against others, in particular due to appearances. I was literally the shallowest asshole. And recently someone sent me their picture and when I saw their face I was put off by their unattractiveness. It just made me realize that I was still the old me and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] never going to change, and thus going to die alone and bitter ^((and a fucking virgin)^). Yes, I know what I am. You wouldn't like me in person unless I pretended to be nice again like I used to. Deep down I want to be genuinely nice and do my best for everyone to get along well, but it doesn't matter because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and when I meet attractive women my age all I can think about is wanting to be intimate with them. I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. A fucking sad loser. I know everybody just wants me to die, not consciously, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] longer appreciated and that just means I should die. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to die yet but if I kill myself I don't want to be alone when I die. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to find a random person and cry on their shoulder as I bleed out and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for that in advance. It's the only way I can feel again.

I guess I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to die alone then, after all.",1
1ltiwqe,1751855587.0,2025-07-07 02:33:07,offmychest,My first time was with a married man,"I commented my story on another post but I decided to just make my own post. This is not something I have told people in my real life about so here it goes …

When I was 17 I formed a friendship with a 34yo married man with kids. I’m not gonna say how because it’s a very specific situation and it’s be too obvious who I am (this isn’t my main account). We would see each other sometimes and he was very helpful when I was getting ready for college and needed rides to work. Obviously my parents had no idea.

I turned 18 right before my high school graduation, and suddenly he confessed his feelings for me. He would tell me that he had to stay married for his kids, but he didn’t really love her and that he only loved me. I ate it up. After our first time having sex he told me he was proud of me for doing a good job. He also liked to bring me around his friends, to “show off” he would tell me to wear certain clothes, and I’m not gonna lie it made me feel sexy and wanted. We continued our relationship through the summer. We would have certain times we were allowed to text, we’d go somewhere to hangout and get food and then go to a motel to have sex. He would tell me that what we had was true love, that he wished things could’ve been different for us and all that good stuff.

I remember being in bed with him after having sex and cuddling when his wife called. He answered and talked to her like nothing was going on at all, asked to speak to the kids and then told her he loved her and hung up and we had sex again. This was something that has stuck with me for the rest of my life, how easily someone could lie and feel nothing. At the time hearing their voices I felt awful, but he would always wipe my tears away and tell me that it wasn’t our fault we were in love.

Eventually I started going to college and got more busy with midterms and finals; and by winter break I had ended things. There wasn’t any kind of big fight or anything, I just think I woke up one morning and I knew that this wasn’t real. He was more annoyed than anything and made me swear never to contact him or his family. He actually threatened me at one point - he kept texting me after I ended things and it would go from a casual ‘how are you’ to ‘you better never contact me or my family’.

The biggest kicker, when I went to him and told him I couldn’t do this anymore and he realized I was serious, he told me - he hopes that this wouldn’t make me go crazy or become a girl who has a lot of casual sex. Like what.

Anyways, this is something I don’t tell people. I don’t want to be judged for being an affair partner, but it felt good to write.",9
1lsq92u,1751768017.0,2025-07-06 02:13:37,offmychest,Happy 30th birthday!,"**Hi all.**  
I don't know why I decided to share this. I guess it becomes pretty hard for me to keep quiet about what's going on with me, but I don't want to break the hearts of my close ones and tell them. So, hear me out, everyone who reads this, if anyone gives a sht about my story at all.

I'm a relatively healthy man with a good job and salary. A year ago, I relocated to Canada with a woman who is the love of my life. But also, I'm a gambling addict.

My gambling story started when I was studying at a university in my hometown. I was seventeen years old when I made my first bet. By then, I had been a football (soccer) player for 10 years, playing as a semi-pro. As it usually happens, it takes some time for you to recognize yourself as an addict. It took a year or maybe two in my case.

About six years ago, when I was twenty-four, I reached my lowest point when I was lying to everyone, stealing money, and other stuff. I lost all the money I could find through sports betting then. I couldn't stop myself, and it took a lot of effort, pain, and other resources from my family to help me with that. But as far as I remember, the main reason I stopped and changed was my girlfriend and the love and support she gave me, even though we had just started dating by then, and I stole her money and some of her things, too. I was humiliated by what I'd done, and I didn't expect her to help me out or to be with me after my actions, even though I was genuinely sorry about that.

Anyway, somehow I was able to stop and start a new life. She helped me find a job, and I have worked for this company ever since. We loved each other and went through a lot of hard times together, like the deaths of our family members and friends. We also left our home because of the war started by our government. We lived in four different countries and had all the difficulties such situations brought to the table. It doesn't matter how difficult it was, but we always had each other because we were best friends.

Still, we had our issues. Mainly because of me, I realize that now. I mean, I wasn't cheating or beating her or even gambling behind her back. Nothing like that at all. I just wasn't attentive to her, and I didn't give her the love she wanted the way she wanted, even though she tried to talk with me about it many times to solve this together. But I always recognized all her attempts as attacks, so I only defended and didn't really listen to her and her pain.

So, six months after we relocated to Canada, our relationship got seriously ill. We didn't fight or anything, everything was pretty quiet and friendly. By the time we technically broke up, we were still living together. When she started dating someone, things got pretty bad for me. I still think she didn't do anything wrong, considering the fact that we broke up, but when she left for a few days with her date just a few days before the New Year Eve, I felt so dead that this thought finally appeared in my mind:  
*""Fck, it couldn't be worse than that, let's bet some money.""*  
I guess I did it to feel alive again and get distracted from the pain I felt. So, within a few days, I've lost all my savings. It wasn't a significant amount, something like my two-month salary.

When she returned home, she told me that she had decided to stop dating the guy she had been dating and give us another chance. I had dreamt of hearing this for the last couple of months. Still, I had to tell her what I did because I didn't want to lie to her, especially after what she said. I don't think you'd be surprised that the news struck her and made her change her mind about us eventually. But again, it wasn't her fault; it was mine.

I know that for sure because she supported me for the next couple of months, even though she occasionally dated that guy. But in those days, I was alone, and I felt so bad that I kept betting and losing money. So I lied to her about how I feel and didn't tell her I couldn't stop. Then, when things got really bad and I didn't have money to pay my half of the rent, I told her, of course. She was pissed off — which is totally fine, I'd be pissed off too.

Right now, it's almost two months since we moved apart. We are still trying to be friends. She found a new guy, and at least she looks happy as far as I can see.

What about me? Well, things got only worse. I have more than 5k in debt. I lost not only the love of my life but myself, too. I don't even mention all of the electronics I've had (TV, PS5, Apple Watch, EarPods, etc.) — I pawned all of that to have extra cash, which I eventually lost. Tomorrow I should pay a fee for the PS5 and watches, and I won't be able to do it, even though the amount is not that big. I just don't have any cash. Again. I guess, the only good thing is that I still have a job and am alive, right?  
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] so sure.

Ten days ago, it was my 30th birthday and I met it alone. That was the worst birthday of my life, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure about that. Even worse, the only reason for that is me.",1
1lshmzc,1751742867.0,2025-07-05 19:14:27,offmychest,Broke up with my ex again,"
**Throwaway account because some of my friends know my Reddit and would kill me if they saw this.**

I F(20) and my ex (19) and I met on Instagram when I was 15 and he was 14. We started talking in DMs, and after a while, we began dating. We broke up after 4–5 months because he used to flirt with other girls online just to make me jealous. This happened a few times while we were dating.

A few months later, he texted me again, apologized for everything, and of course, I had to be a saint and forgive him. But I didn’t date him again. We stayed friends, and he kept flirting with me, trying to win me back.

Then, on New Year’s Eve that year, he suddenly blocked me. He said he couldn’t move on if we stayed friends and wished me good luck in life. I was actually happy he finally realized it wasn’t going anywhere and decided to move on.

In 2022, I met my current boyfriend, and I’m still with him. He’s really sweet and helped me love myself again. He supports me, listens without judging, and is always there for me. He’s been my biggest cheerleader since the day we met.

I have a public Instagram art account, and I’m kind of active there. I noticed an account watching my stories that had the same name as my ex. I figured he might just be stalking a little. Since he didn’t text me, I ignored it. About two weeks ago, I saw a message request and realized it was from him. Being the gossip queen I am, I replied. I did tell my boyfriend, and he was chill about it.

My ex and I chatted a little. I kept my replies short and straight to the point so he wouldn’t get any ideas. I stopped replying four days ago because I started to feel like it was wrong to talk to him while being in a relationship.

Today, he messaged asking why my replies were so short when he was sending long, nice messages. I told him he sounded really desperate and reminded him that I’m in a relationship. Then I asked if he ever actually moved on. He said no, he tried, but it was hard because he couldn’t forget about me.

We ended up talking about our past, and honestly, it felt kind of nice to remember my first “love” (if I can even call it that). He told me he got influenced by his friends and flirted with other girls to make me jealous because he thought that would make me more possessive of him. He said he regrets how he acted when we were kids.

I realized I never really hated him, even though he made me feel terrible. Maybe it’s because he was the first guy I ever liked. Then he asked me to give him a proper breakup message, with all the anger and emotions I felt back then. I couldn’t write anything mean, but I still tried.

While I was typing, he texted again saying he loved me back then and maybe still does. He thanked me for the memories and said he’ll try to fall in love again, though he doesn’t think it’s possible right now. He wished me good luck.

I didn’t reply to that. I sent the breakup message (which wasn’t even angry), and before he could respond, I blocked him.

After that, I felt sad. I started thinking about how things might’ve been if he had just communicated better when we were dating. But then I thought about my current boyfriend. Maybe he doesn’t bring the same thrill, but he makes me feel safe. With him, I don’t have to pretend to be someone I’m not.

I don’t think I’ll tell my boyfriend about this,at least not right now,because I know I’m too emotional at the moment.

( I just wanted to rant it out somewhere, and also, i used chatgpt to frame my sentences, English is not my first language and I didn't wanted to sound too stupid)

1l8ohfx,1749635092.0,2025-06-11 09:44:52,offmychest,I Don't Miss My Mother and I Do Not Feel Guilty About It,"Hi. I'm 22, a student, and a mom to a beautiful 4-year-old girl. I’ve never shared this part of my story publicly, but I think I need to finally do so.

My mother passed away, and when it happened… I felt more relieved than sad. I don't talk about it much because when people who knew her speak about her, they describe her like she was this strong, wonderful, fiery woman. And I just smile and nod. But inside, I remember the beatings. I remember the time she broke my arm with a metal rod because I burnt food. I remember the spade she used when my little sister stained her clothes, and she blamed me for “not watching her child.”

I was never at peace around her. Even when I was with my cousins, I’d sometimes tell them to be quiet just so I could listen for her voice, to hear if she was calling me. Because if I didn’t answer fast enough… I’d pay for it.

I’m angry at her. Not because she’s gone, but because she never got to be the mother I needed. I was scared of her. I never felt protected. I never felt truly loved. She was not the kind of mother I want to be.

Now, as an adult, it shows up in ways I never expected. I struggle with setting boundaries because I’m scared that if I say “no,” people will get angry and leave me. I people-please without even realizing it. I crave parental love from romantic partners, which I know is unfair to them and to me. I shrink myself just to be accepted. I walk on eggshells with everyone, even when I’m safe, like my brain is always scanning for danger that isn’t there.

And now that I have my daughter, that fear lingers. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of becoming my mother. I shout sometimes, and my daughter just laughs and kisses me, like she knows I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not to fall apart. I want her to feel safe with me. I want her to be able to tell me everything. I want to be her person, her safe place, the way I never had one.

Sometimes I cry when I’m alone, not from sadness, but from the weight of everything I never got. I don’t miss my mother. I don’t love her in the way people expect me to. And honestly? I don’t feel guilty about that anymore. She was supposed to be my best friend. My haven. And she wasn’t.

If you've ever felt this, this relief after a parent's death, or this fear of turning into them, you're not alone. I don’t know what healing looks like yet, but I know it started the moment I allowed myself to admit this truth.

Thank you for reading.",0

**Prologue**

“I never knew when was the last time he looked at me like he did at the beginning. Only one day did he stop doing it…”

I want to reiterate this is my truth about all the events that happened so far in my life...

This kind of experience, I need to share with someone, to externalize everything that happened to me so far, it's been difficult so far. All I can think of is that every heartbreak is proof that I can love again... I’m thankfull for all the pain.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to start by the present moment, listening music using this app as a diary, trying journaling -- not very successful at it. So this is it…

It is past midnight, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] on the floor of my kitchen, my back resting against the fridge, legs stretched in silence. In my hand, a half-full lass of wine. Next to me, a crumpled napkin with almond crumbs and a folded note I never managed to throw away in my journal. It’s the one he left me with the first Valentine we spent together. I told myself I kept it out of absentmindedness, but the truth is more dangerous than that: I kept it because it gave shape to something I once believed in. I don’t even know what I’m hoping for now...

I’ve been trying to write tis story for a while. Not because I want revenge, not because I want pity. But because if I don’t take this pain out of my chest, I’m afraid it will become a permanent scar that doesn’t heal. I am [REDACTED_NAME] writing this for him. I’m writing this for the version of me that keeps showing up at 5 a.m. with a hole in his stomach, gasping for air, wondering…. Why do someone who promised care chose brutal and complete silence instead.

This story is not just about “him”.  It’s  all the ghost that came before him. The ones I kissed. The ones I forgave. The one I waited for at stations they never arrived to. This is my way of making sure that I do not become the sum of who left me. Feeding my open wounded traumas that I once thought they healed.

Some people confuse heartbreak and vulnerability with weakness. I no longer do… Every heartbreak is a proof that I can still love. Deeply. Completely. Even if I have to learn again how to love myself after it. It is a proof that I am [REDACTED_NAME] in this world.

So here it goes. My story. In fragments of what I recall. In wounds that still burns. In the little acts of courage that came from holding someone’s hand without fear of people’s gaze, and in the even greater ones of letting it go.

And if one day someone finds this story and sees their own reflection in it then maybe all this mattered. Learn from me, learn from my feelings and my pain...

**Chapter I: Before Loving**

# 1. A Sensitive Childhood

I remember the softness of the white sheets and the smell of soap on Mom’s T-shirt when she hugged me before bed. My childhood was happy, sheltered by the warmth of a small family in which Mom was the center of everything. Mom—so young and strong—was both refuge and heroine; in her arms I felt protected from the world. I was a profoundly sensitive child: I cried at sad movies, was moved by lullabies, and needed physical affection the way plants need the sun.

From a very young age I developed a vivid imagination. I spent hours watching the clouds, inventing stories about the shapes only I could see in the sky or in the stains on the ceiling. I played in my room, silently, while Mom watched me with a smile.

There were few luxuries at home, but hugs and sweet words were abundant. Whenever sadness or incomprehension knocked at the door of my small chest, I sought comfort in a soft plush bear that always slept with me. I would stroke its fabric ears and press it against my racing heart, finding secret solace in that toy embrace. Mom often found me asleep with the teddy bear trapped between my arms and would tuck me in tenderly without waking me. To me, that stuffed animal and my mother’s hugs were synonymous with home and safety.

# 2. Loss and the Move

The year 2004 marked a rupture that split my life in two. On an autumn dawn my sister’s short life suddenly went out forever. Her sudden death struck us like lightning from a clear sky, leaving us stunned and torn apart. I remember Mom crying silently that night, believing I was asleep, but her sobs reached me through the wall. I was only a child and couldn’t fully grasp what death meant; I only felt an icy void in my stomach and a new fear—the fear of realizing that the people we love can disappear from one day to the next.

After the funeral, Mom decided that moving would be the best option, and my father—who had found another opportunity—accepted it without protest. Our home, once full of laughter and happy memories, had become a painful museum in which every corner whispered my absent sister’s name. We packed our lives into cardboard boxes amid silent tears. I remember putting my teddy bear into one of those boxes, afraid that in the new house it would no longer smell like our old life. We moved to another city in search of a new beginning, though I felt we left a piece of our soul behind those walls.

The move didn’t just mean a change of scenery—arriving in the Chilean desert—it also marked the beginning of a profound loneliness. In the new city I felt lost, friendless, with a mother carrying her own pain while trying to be strong for me, and I trying to be strong for her. Dad got a job and spent long hours away supporting us, so many afternoons I came back to a silent, empty house, while Mom, when she was home, devoted herself entirely to me.

One night, shortly after settling into the new house, I broke down in tears, clutching my pillow. Memories of my sister invaded the darkness of my unfamiliar room and the anguish overwhelmed me. Mom heard my sobs and rushed in. She sat on my bed and wrapped me in her protective arms.

*“I know, my love, I know…”* Mom whispered, cradling me against her chest.  
I buried my face in her T-shirt and let her tears mix with mine.  
*“Why did she leave?”* I cried, my voice breaking. *“I miss her so much…”*  
*“I don’t know, sweetheart,”* she replied, her voice trembling slightly. *“Sometimes things happen that we don’t understand. But I’m here with you. You’re not alone—never forget that.”*

Her words, spoken with such love, were an anchor amid my pain. That night I fell asleep in her arms, listening to her heartbeat, and I silently promised myself to be strong for both of us—for Mom and for my sister’s memory.

# 3. Refuge in Imagination

Over time I learned to hide my sadness and my sense of strangeness behind a shy smile and a rich inner world. The words of my primary-school teacher echoed in my head as I matured so quickly after the loss: *“The pain you feel will never disappear, but each day it will be easier to carry.”*

I had always been prone to daydreaming, but after the loss it intensified. At school I was the quiet kid who drew in the margins of his notebooks and got lost staring out the window. While the other boys played soccer at recess, I preferred to sit under a tree reading or simply imagining stories.

My classmates’ inability to understand my sensitivity made me feel isolated. Some called me “weird” behind my back because I sometimes got too emotional in class or because I preferred talking about books instead of sports. Little by little, my refuge became my own mind. If I felt lonely at lunchtime, I pretended to talk with imaginary friends who always listened. On silent afternoons at home I invented conversations and fantastic adventures so I wouldn’t feel so alone. Mom would come to collect me, and I waited for her, telling stories to the air until I heard the key in the door and then recounted my day in detail.

Every night when I went to bed I still needed a hug to fall asleep. As I grew, my stuffed animals were relegated to the closet, replaced by a pillow that I hugged tightly to my chest. I missed human warmth, and by squeezing the pillow I could fool loneliness for a moment; I imagined it was someone holding me back in the darkness. That intimate habit became my best-kept secret—a small routine that let me feel safe, just as when Mom used to slip in quietly to tuck me in during childhood.

# 4. Secrets of the Heart

When puberty arrived, it brought more questions than answers. At the new school I made one or two friends—quiet boys with whom I shared comics and study sessions. Yet I began to realize I was different from them in a way I didn’t know how to name. I discovered it almost unintentionally, through a silent, deep attraction to a classmate. His name was Adrien; he had an easy laugh and honey-colored eyes that sparkled when he talked about what he loved. At first I thought what I felt for Adrien was admiration: I wanted to spend all my time beside him, I worried if he missed class, and I memorized each of his gestures without meaning to.

One afternoon, while we were doing homework in his room, I noticed myself tracing the line of his jaw when he looked away, or the way a lock of his brown hair fell across his forehead. My heart beat so fast I feared he could hear it in the silence around us.

That afternoon, back home, I replayed every moment of the day with a mix of excitement and shame. Why did my friend seem so handsome? Why did I want to hug him when he was sad, or simply stay over so I could wake up beside him? No other boy spoke of such things; they joked about girls while I nodded silently, feeling I carried an immense secret. With terror I began to understand that what I felt was not admiration but attraction—a yearning that not only cherished his good soul or the way he made me laugh, but also urged me to brush his hand, to be close in a way that frightened me.

Guilt accompanied me for months as I struggled to understand my feelings. Whenever I heard at church that true love could exist only between a man and a woman, my stomach knotted and I wondered if what I felt was wrong.

I was barely thirteen and already bore a secret that felt too heavy: I liked boys. Or rather, I liked one boy—Adrien—and I didn’t know whether that meant my whole being was different from everyone else’s. I said nothing. I didn’t tell Mom, afraid of disappointing her or losing her love. I confessed to no one. I learned to smile and pretend everything was normal while inside I wrestled with the piercing joy of feeling something beautiful and the terror of feeling something forbidden.

To cope, I returned to writing and fantasy. I filled secret diaries with letters I never dared to deliver, addressed to that friend to whom I never confessed the truth. In my stories, sometimes two princes fell in love in a distant kingdom, and I could give them the happy ending I didn’t believe possible for myself in reality. Those tales hidden under the mattress were my way of easing the pressure of an adolescent heart flooded with silences.

# 6. A Glance at the Airport

I was fourteen when I first experienced a clear and unmistakable desire—the kind that suddenly ignites the body. It happened in a Brazilian airport during a long layover on a trip with Mom and Dad. We were in the waiting lounge, surrounded by strangers and the distant murmur of loudspeakers. Bored, I let my gaze wander when my eyes met those of another boy, about my age, waiting across the room. He had dark hair, sun-bronzed skin, and an intent expression, as if he too were studying the travelers’ faces.

It was only an instant—a fraction of a second that felt outside of time: a sustained look that said everything without a single word. Heat surged up my neck to my cheeks. My chest leapt, and something inside me woke with force. In those unknown eyes I discovered desire. It wasn’t just that he was handsome—he was, with a fragile, captivating beauty—but the way my body reacted: an electric tingling over my skin, my palms sweating, and a new need to approach him, to hear his voice, to smell his T-shirt up close, to feel our arms brush.

He held my gaze, and for a moment the airport din vanished. Did he feel something similar? I’ll never know. A voice announced his flight; I watched him rise with his family and knew I would never see him again. Yet as he walked away, he turned his head once more toward me. He was still looking. I sat petrified, heart pounding. I held his gaze until the last second, until he vanished into the crowd. Then I exhaled, realizing I’d been holding my breath. I felt both dazed and euphoric.

Mom, sitting beside me, noticed nothing; she was reading a magazine, unaware of the silent revolution that had just shaken me. That brief encounter confirmed what I already suspected: it wasn’t just Adrien, it wasn’t a passing idea. My desire—my love—was directed toward other boys. And for the first time, instead of guilt, I felt a spark of pure authenticity ignite inside me.

# 6. Mom’s Comfort

That spark of self-acceptance wasn’t enough to dispel all my fears. Back home, I resumed my routine of silences and forced smiles. Adrien had changed schools and almost stopped seeing me; our friendship faded with distance, leaving the bittersweet taste of a first love that slips away before it is born. At fifteen I was a reserved boy with a secret world beating beneath a calm exterior. Mom sometimes saw an unnamed sadness in my eyes. Intuitive as ever, she sensed something was wrong, but she respected my silence.

One early morning I could no longer contain the pressure in my chest. I had spent the day feeling especially alone—maybe adolescence, hormones, or simply the weight of so many hidden thoughts. I sought refuge in my room and tried to sleep, hugging my pillow as usual, but that night the usual comfort never came. Tears began to fall and I couldn’t stop them. It was a low, almost silent cry, but in the stillness of the night any sob is deafening.

Mom opened my door carefully, lit only by the hallway’s dim light. She found me curled up on the bed, clutching a tear-soaked pillow. Without a word she slipped into bed beside me, as she did when I was little, and wrapped me in a warm embrace.

*“Do you want to tell me?”* she whispered, using the soft voice that always chased my storms away.  
I shook my head, unable to meet her eyes. How could I explain the whirlwind inside me? I feared the truth would hurt her—or worse, disappoint her. But being there, in her arms, gave me back the sense that nothing bad could happen.

*“It’s okay if you don’t want to talk,”* she said, kissing my forehead. *“I just want you to know that I love you exactly as you are, son. Nothing could change that, do you hear? Nothing.”*

Her voice broke on the last word, showing she was speaking from the heart. I clung to her tighter, feeling the words I didn’t dare say spill into that embrace. In silence I asked forgiveness for not being the perfect son she might have imagined; in silence I begged her never to let me go.

*“I love you, Mom,”* I finally murmured in a whisper.  
Her hand traced slow circles on my back, just as when I was a child frightened by nightmares, her thumb making a cross on my forehead.  
*“And I love you, my life. Always,”* she answered, resting her cheek on my head.

We spoke no more—there was no need. I fell asleep with my face against her chest, exhausted but at peace, listening to the steady beating of her heart. Before drifting off, her last words echoed in my mind: *I love you exactly as you are.* Mom didn’t know it, but that was precisely what I needed to keep from collapsing—the certainty that, whatever my truth, her love would remain intact. That certainty became the compass guiding my idea of love in the years that followed me into adulthood.

The next morning no secret was revealed, no question asked. Mom smiled gently at breakfast, and I understood her complicit silence was her way of giving me space. I realized that, too, was a form of love.

That same morning, before heading to school, I paused at my bedroom door. I looked at the rumpled bed: the pillow still damp with night-time tears and, on the wrinkled sheets, timidly poking out, the old plush toy of my childhood that I had rescued from the closet sometime in the night. The sight overwhelmed me. For a moment, the child I had been and the young man I was becoming met in that reflection: both hugging something so as not to feel so alone, both silently longing for a love that had not yet arrived.

The scene repeated itself years later, tinged with more bitterness. Just as in childhood I had fallen asleep clutching my teddy bear for safety, as an adult I found myself crying in the early hours, hugging a pillow in a cold bed.",1
1jwzjv4,1744402781.0,2025-04-11 20:19:41,offmychest,"I am worried about my sexuality, think something is wrong with me, and fear I will be alone","This will undoubtedly be one of the hardest things I've ever written. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if I am [REDACTED_NAME] this to seek reassurance, get an idea of what people feel, or some combination of the two.

This fear started when I was probably 24-25 (I am 35 now). It was around the time the Woody Allen sexual assault news came out. I remember thinking that some part of me was like Woody Allen and that I could commit something like that. I don't know where the thought came from or why it came there, but I think I was feeling guilty about two relationships:

1. When I was a senior in college (21), I dated a 16-year-old girl (turned 17 when dating), whom I worked with. This was for a few months over the summer/beginning of my last semester in college. We got to 1st/2nd base to the best of my memory. I remember liking and being interested in her, and at the time (I swear to you), I didn't think it too weird. We worked together, and I felt more like a peer to her. That is not to say that I feel this way now- I have a lot of regret and shame about doing this, and for most of what I am [REDACTED_NAME] here.
2. After this, I had another relationship with a girl who was 17 and I was 22. To the best of my memory, this relationship lasted for around four months. This relationship was more serious in terms of what we did—while we didn't have sex, we probably got somewhere between second and third base. This was someone I knew who went to my high school, whom I met when seeing some friends/acquaintances there. This ended for many reasons, mainly because I was unsure about the relationship.

These two events mostly stayed out of my conscious awareness until the time mentioned above. I thought this meant that there was something seriously wrong with me. I also noticed that my crushes were usually, if not always, younger than me. I cannot remember how, but this led me to search all sorts of things and possible reasons why, and it eventually corresponded to an article about prenatal testosterone influencing the ratio of a person's index and ring finger. Basically, people have longer ring fingers than index fingers, and this ratio is more pronounced in men because they were exposed to greater testosterone in the womb.

I then started measuring my fingers and found that my ratio was abnormal. In other words, I wish(ed) my ring finger were longer. I think I also found an article that said that men with high digit ratios were more likely to be pedophiles. However, I now think I misread it and instead read an article that said they were more likely to endorse paraphilic tendencies. Needless to say, I would spend a lot of time measuring my fingers-- first with a ruler, then with a picture on my phone, and finally, I would make photocopies of my hand to measure or digital scans of my hand to measure them digitally. I can't tell you how much time I spent on this. Hours and hours. I also developed a severe anxiety being around children, my libido in general tanked, and I started checking to see who I was even attracted to. This all led to the point of me holding a knife in my living room and seriously considering killing myself for being this way.

Fortunately, I didn't do that. Another thing happened during this time, and I became extremely anxious about being in relationships. During this time, I got into an on-again/off-again relationship and became so anxious about whether this person was right for me. This ended badly (she basically cheated on me). The pain from this was extreme. I remember crying at 1 AM on some random street. I started smoking and was probably at my lowest point.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure how, but I think the pain from the relationship, a career change, and a long-distance move slowly took my mind away from the stuff around my sexuality. I moved halfway across the country to start grad school and soon met someone of a similar age. We dated for almost two years, with the same fears about it being ""right"" or ""good enough."" This relationship felt very safe and was my longest relationship to date; however, I felt something was missing, even though I didn't know what. I was attracted to this person, so that wasn't it, although sex was a bit boring sometimes. I also really didn't like her nipples (I know this is random, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to be as transparent as possible).

By the time I finished my master's and moved again for my doctoral program, I had ended this relationship and the stuff around my sexuality and hands was gone. I didn't think about it; it didn't worry me. I met various girls off-and-on for 1.5 years before meeting my next girlfriend, who was 25 when I was 28. I found her attractive and was pretty smitten with her the first few weeks, but slowly, the same anxieties came around this relationship. Mainly not feeling ""in love"" enough, worrying about fit, etc. We dated on and off for two years. I cared about and loved this person, and this relationship was one I look back on and think it ""got away."" I loved this person deeply and miss her.

After this relationship, I was single for a year and moved to finish my degree. This was when COVID came back again. I was struggling with isolation and also the ending of my previous relationship. I wasn't dating because I knew I would only be where I was for a year. I was struggling a lot with my mental health, but the stuff about attraction and hands didn't come up until the tail end of that year. I remember it very vividly. I was watching a British detective show, and one of the characters was attracted to a high school student and was the episode's villain. He was a stereotypical creepy guy, and I remember thinking, ""Well, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to that girl.""

This situation filled me with a lot of anxiety, and the process with my hands and attraction started, but in a slightly different way, where I wasn't worried about my attraction to children, but my attraction to teens, as well as intensely measuring my hands and looking at other people's hands. This continued when I started my first job after my doctoral program, and became so bad that I took a leave of absence to stay with friends and work on my mental health. I also knew I wasn't staying at this location long (it was a temporary job), and the constant moving and not having roots impacted me. I felt so lonely and empty.

I tried many things during this time (TMS, Ketamine, Psilocybin) with varying impact. I had a brief relationship with a girl (26 when I was 32) that went very badly. When I got to where I am [REDACTED_NAME] for my latest job, I had been prescribed prozac, and a lot of these thoughts had subsided somewhat. I also realized from that last relationship that I had some interest in BDSM, and found that age gap relationships were more accepted there. This provided an avenue for me to explore these themes some, along with other aspects of BDSM I had never considered. I think that sexuality was/is so anxiety-riddled for me that I have never allowed myself to explore. For a summer I said ""fuck it"" and explored my sexuality-- this included random things like going to massage parlors for happy endings, traveling to Europe and having random sexual encounters with prostitutes, and just hooking up with people. No, I didn't have sex with any minors, and the only illegal thing I did was pay for sex.

Around this time last year, I met my latest girlfriend, who was much younger than me (I am 35 now, she is 21), on Tinder. At first, I looked at it as another sexual fling, but we developed a relationship. I ended it for similar reasons as above, around doubting the fit of the relationship and feeling something was not right. We are still friends and care about each other a lot. During this time (once again), my thoughts around my sexuality and hands weren't there. Now that we have broken up, those thoughts have come back some.

That is my story to the best I can tell it in any sort of quick way. I am [REDACTED_NAME] dating and realizing I am [REDACTED_NAME] less attracted to women my own age (35) than younger women (have it set on my phone for 21 to 30). I am [REDACTED_NAME] interested in dating anyone younger than 21 because of the anxiety that it produces within me, and the lack of fit that is usually there.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] about my sexuality. I am [REDACTED_NAME] scared I will be alone for the rest of my life. I have never watched anything illegal, but gravitate towards the ""teen"" sections on Xvideos, as well as other taboo things (fucked up family, teacher) and more normal sections (redhead, asian, casting couch).

That being said, I find 15/16 year olds attractive all the time. Hell, I met a 13-year-old that I thought was cute and that filled me with a lot of dread. I obviously would never do anything at this stage of my life. I find 25/26 year olds just as attractive. It is really, really fucking hard to not be able to say this to anyone. So I am [REDACTED_NAME] it here.

I want to thank anyone who took the time to read this. Thank you and take care.",0

1dh6wah,1718542204.0,2024-06-16 12:50:04,offmychest,I cut away my core family and have never been happier.,"I (26M) grew up in a fortunate family. I was raised in a fairly large house with my older brother, a stay at home mom, and my dad worked from home many years before it was the norm. Unfortunately, both of my parents have a pretty good deal of unresolved trauma. Even when I was little, I was never really listened to, but generally I got things I wanted. I can honestly say I was content, but I lived in constant anxiety. I have heard so many stories of people with worse situations so I just internalized it and assumed it was normal and kept moving, because my dad did everything he could to maintain an aura of fear. Every offense was punishable to some degree, usually just yelling. Like I said, it was not particularly brutal in the grand scheme of things, but I think it is not unlike having a rock in your shoes for 15 years. It hurts, then damages you, then permanently alters your structure.As I said, I kept moving forward pretty easily until I was in about middle school. As I started to develop teen angst, home life became much harder for me. I would wager it had to do with having to live for years in this aura of fear, but it was around here my brother and I learned my dad developed cancer in a way that affected his hormone levels permanently when I was about 6. Of course, this scared young me but he lived just fine. Being that I was about 13 then though, I assumed he was so hair-triggered by things because of the cancer, so I was hoping this news of him being declared cancer free would mean maybe things would get easier around the house. They certainly did not. His expectations of my brother and I grew in an unhealthy way, as we were expected to treat him more like a boss than a father now. We were both straight A students, but there never seemed to be a way to make him actually proud of anything we accomplished. We tried for some years, growing more and more tired of his ways internally as we entered high school.



My brother and I became more open about our disdain for our treatment between ourselves, and voiced our complaints to our mom who would then try to talk to him to no avail. Whether she actually did talk to him or not, I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure. At this point, I began having suicidal thoughts because I was too tired to keep living in this way. In one distinct instance, I would regularly oversleep and my dad yelled at me about it, and told me only depressed people sleep that long, so I should see a doctor. I happily agreed and asked to see a doctor and was told no, I was being ridiculous; because I have everything I wanted so how could I be depressed. I figured they were right, so I just clammed up about it and tried to keep moving.My brother graduated high school and went to a prestigious state university, but failed out after the first semester. I should also mention, both he and I were moderately overweight, just barely on the line for obesity our whole lives to that point, and when he returned he had lost roughly 60 pounds in 1 semester and was dangerously skinny. He was getting in fights and barely making it to classes- and that was all he told us. I was excited to try to go to the same school as him, but that semester, with scholarships, still cost him $40,000; completely shattering my faith in colleges as a whole. (Cost was not an issue for my family, as my dad had set up college plans for us both, but more on that later.) I was no longer excited to go to college, but I knew I needed more than anything to get there so I could be away from him. Finally, it is my turn to graduate college. At this point, I am [REDACTED_NAME] well a mess, and college made it so much worse. I chose a STEM major under duress, as my brother and I needed to give a presentation to my dad about what degree we wanted and why. No matter what answer we gave, he kept closing paths off until arriving at a coerced decision on a major he selected. By this, I mean if I had selected say, nursing as a degree I would have been told no; why not choose something more lucrative like a law degree, and effectively the discussion would last until I folded and said ‘okay a law degree sounds good’. I survived my first year in that degree, before having a math class break me in half, failing me out of the ability to continue on that path. The meeting was then reconvened, and a new major was selected for me (Which I went on to successfully obtain). With some college credits already obtained in high school, it took me 5.5 years to graduate with a bachelor’s degree because of how many classes I failed, still barely obtaining my degree on 2 fronts.  
  


My finances were micromanaged each week, where we had meetings about investments and savings. At one point, he found out my brother and I had spent too much of our own money and required us to provide receipts so we could “pay back” what we owed ourselves.



We were also required to have trackers on our phones and cars, as well as we would watch a family movie on the weekend, which could not be skipped. 

In this hell of mine, right upon starting college I met a girl. We met in a video game and were excellent friends, she was in a relationship so I tried my best to not be /that/ guy towards her, but we got along very well. As it turned out, she was in an incredibly abusive relationship which we would end up working together to get her out of, and ended up falling in love. (This bit could be a post of its own, it was honestly an incredible story but I will remain on topic!) The issue was, I lived on the east coast, and she lived in the west coast with her son. We dated long distance for a while, and I began to let my guard down for her. I was almost impossible to get to share details, as she was my first girlfriend and I did not know how to tell her about my experiences without sounding crazy. Over time she got the whole run of stories I was able to remember, and helped guide me to seeking professional help. She told me it was unhealthy to have family so close with no boundaries, as my parents had full reign over my life, but I didn’t know anything else. She wanted me to escape, but did not want her own wants to harm me, so I spoke with a therapist about it. In my 2nd or 3rd session we were already planning how I was going to escape my family.Let me refer back to the title now, I did not say I cut out my parents, I said my core family. My brother, who I referenced earlier, was quite supportive of me and was more willing to fight with my dad now that he simply didn’t give a shit anymore what he thought. He was having a hard time finding a good girlfriend, but then, in about february he was introduced to a girl who he ended up dating. At first glance she seemed fine. As in, somewhat normal, not outstanding or even a good fit for him, but totally fine for a girlfriend. In may of this same year, she was giving her two cents on my situation and what I was doing, which I feel is completely out of pocket; as we didn’t know who she was 3 months prior. My brother grew more and more unhealthily attached to this girl and turned against me more and more viciously starting with her first appearance.As I mentioned earlier, college was taken care of, as my dad had a set amount of money, say $125,000 set aside for each of us for college. Our deal was, any money NOT spent we would get half of. Example being, if we never touched that money via a full ride scholarship and other means, on graduation day we would get a check for $62,500. Not going to college was not an option, and going to college meant getting a bachelor’s in anything. There was a physical contract, which unfortunately I do not have a copy of…



In that same May I mentioned, I was preparing to graduate college and then immediately move in with my girlfriend of 2 years. We had never met up to that point, but we knew we would work. We talked about so many options about how we would physically get together, but the only thing that made any sense was for me to move out to her. Which, made the most sense as she was in school after recovering from a house fire and had a son, and I was freshly graduated and had no obligations. I needed to keep her a secret though, as my family does not believe in any relationship online being real, ever. Especially, how would we date? That would mean I had to move! So, I kept her a secret as well as the move, which I had planned to take what I could carry and disappear.As the end came nearer, and my freedom grew closer, it had to be late April or early May, my dad had weekly meetings with my brother and I about exactly which jobs we applied to and why. I was not looking for jobs in my state anymore, and let slip the name of her city. In one last naive blunder, I had hoped they would support me and the girlfriend I had revealed.



Instead, I began the worst month of my life. 



I was constantly tormented from every angle, and was having daily panic attacks. I was cut off from everything except ‘Babys first credit card!’ which had a limit of $300, and what was left in my bank account. Thankfully, I already bought the plane tickets and was going to just visit and see if we were a good fit in real life. My mom and dad visited and sat me down for a lecture that was about 2 hours where he tried to tell me work was more important than family, which prompted a “what the fuck, \[dad\]?” from my mom, as well as some colorful insults for my girlfriend, whom they had never met and knew nothing about. 



I survived the month and made it cross country without a hitch, and was safely with my girlfriend for the first time. 

I finally felt safe.—-------------------



My girlfriend let me relax and unwind for a few months as I met my new family and became acquainted with her son (who loved me immediately, woo!) During this time, we lived off of savings and enjoyed life. I still had many panic attacks due to fears of my parents coming to get me, but things calmed down and I finally went and got my first job. 

Everything was going great now that my life was finally my own, and one night I was playing mario party with my girlfriend’s son and father, and I got a call from my brother. I pick up the phone and he is screaming at me that I need to “fix this” right now with my parents, so I told him to not ever tell me what I need to do again, and hang up on him for the first time in my life. Because again, I was finally happy and somehow no one in my immediate family seemed to care.A few months after, he called me after he was woken up by his girlfriend demanding to go through his entire phone because she had a dream he was gay. I told him this was absolutely fucking nuts and that she had no right to do that, but he said he had to let her. At this point, she forced him to delete every app we communicated on (Think twitter, snapchat, etc). He was also barred from going to the gym, in case he looks at girls there.



My first job wasn’t working out so well, so I found a new job and began working there. We were already set on getting married, but my job gave us 2 weeks for insurance elections so we opted to just get married real fast for that, and when my family relented we would hold a proper ceremony. (3-ish years later, and that plan has sailed.) We are happier than ever, and at this point I am [REDACTED_NAME] longer hearing from any of the 3 of them, as I am [REDACTED_NAME] to put up boundaries with my dad, and he reacted by no longer responding to me.More time passes, and I seek counseling again, as I am [REDACTED_NAME] having on and off panic attacks, so I finally decide to end it all. I realize at this point my mom never did a thing to stop my dad from treating me that way, my dad had no desire to get better, and my brother was rapidly becoming a piece of shit. So, I sent my dad a massive ultimatum about the way I felt about how he treated me, and told him when he was ready to talk he could tell my mom and she could text me so I could unblock him. This was about 2 years ago now.My brother continued to get meaner, but my family still does not know I am [REDACTED_NAME]. He announces his engagement, so my wife and I go into “oh shit” mode, because now we have a timer to tell my parents we are married. We give him and his fiancee time to enjoy their announcement, about a month or so, before telling him I have been married for a while. The reason it came out at all was honestly staggering.He tried to propose to her the Christmas prior with a gorgeous ring with a precious stone, but not diamond. She rejected it, and then tried to demand a $16,000 engagement ring from my brother who had about a paperclip and a half a potato chip in his savings. She eventually relented and accepted a $4,000 ring. Again, this was her engagement ring, not her wedding ring.

He called me to tell me directly about his engagement, and was going to ask me to be his best man, but he told me under no circumstances could my “girlfriend” or her son come. The reason was that she would “punch a waiter and set a couch on fire”, apparently? Again, they have not met her and she would never do something like that, so I unload on him and tell him I have been married, and if she isn’t going I certainly am not either. That was the last time I had any contact with him. Their wedding has not happened yet as of posting this, but I fear for him. Now, I have an incredible work from home job where I get to see my wife daily and game with her and my son all the time. She finished her degree and has an even better job than I do, and I couldn’t be luckier. I am [REDACTED_NAME] everything I can to help encourage people who were depressed like I was that it does get better, with some luck and some trying. There are plenty of details I left out or changed in the interest of anonymity, but I wanted to share my story just to say it all at once somewhere. I did have some other family members such as my grandma and an aunt and uncle who were and still are much more supportive, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] for them. Thank you for reading!",132
1jgfyyj,1742561153.0,2025-03-21 12:45:53,offmychest,I wish I could forget,"So here I am, M34. I had a though breakup 3 years ago. I was completely heartbroken and went to a dark place and started pushing my limits, training and doing drugs but that just made It worse. Until one day I just couldn't take it anymore and went drunk driving in the middle of the night, I was living in the north of Sweden so it was a Highway in the woods kind of. I just started pumping the gas, no cars on the road and raging in my head until suddenly I lost control of the car, it flew of the road bumped into a street light then finally thrown into a tree. I remember how relaxed I was and at peace. When I woke up I was disappointed, I was alive and hurting all over. I managed to walk for a long time until I found a house and knocked on the door. A kind lady drove me home and from there I was just done with life. I started going to therapy cause the owner of the restaurant I was in charge off told me her husband took suicide as a ticket out and she understood I was in pain even though I told her nothing of the incident. Therapy didn't help, or maybe it did. At first I was just in bed or at the computer, dishes piling up. I was not enjoying my life. 

I don't know why but I went on tinder, I had a 20F moving in as my neighbor, we matched on tinder and one night I went over to here, after some talking and laying on her sofa cuddling we started kissing, she was so damn hot like a model I had no idea what she saw in me. But as I started kissing her and touching her I got a weird feeling, I realized I was not turned on. Disappointed I stopped what I was doing. Tried talking more but felt she was a bit off so I excused myself. 
Next I found a girl on tinder when I was visiting my sister 7 hours away. That connection gave me a real boost, we just talked for hours easily 4-5 hours at the evening, video chatting. She was so cute, and we had fun and from that connection I started feeling attraction. She asked me to come to here one night, she didn't want to sleep alone. But I was like, how it's 7 hours away, but maybe in the weekend? Then she told me she was going to take her car to me same weekend. Next day I get a text that it went to fast and she needs to focus on her 5 yo. So again I was left and struggling with motivation. 
Later I moved to my sister's city, got an RV and went all forest mode. Just doing drugs and alcohol in my RV. Finally got to the point of my second suicide attempt that got stopped by my brother in law just coming by my house and found me almost od'd and got me to a hospital. Since then I started going to rehab then NA. I've taken so many white badges...
But going to the point where I am [REDACTED_NAME] and the reason for this post is I met up with this girl with the kid again. We got in touch again in December. Felt amazing and I forgot she left me. This last weekend we spent together was amazing, in bed naked just holding each other, no sex, just exploring each other's bodies and kissing, I felt that was intimately fire and had no desire for it to end with sex weirdly enough. Holding her before I left she told me to never let go and we kissed and I told her I wont. Next day I got a text from her telling me she is still in love with her ex and we can't talk or see each other anymore. The air went heavy and my heart started to pound so fast. I called her and asked her what happened and If she was okey. She was totally different, cold in her voice and annoyed. She cut the talk short and told me sha had to go back to her son. There I was again. I got no answers. And I bet I will never get any. She just cut me loose again. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] really bad, playing the weekend together all over again. Wondering if something is broken inside of me. Or if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not ment to find love again. I have no motivation for it. But I'm [REDACTED_NAME] as hell to train this time. Just going to train myself and maybe my brain will heal better from all the drugs. I took my Gravel bike to work yesterday like 7.1 miles back and forth. I like this feeling, pushing my limits, working through pain. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] old boxer, maybe to sensitive for it really, never wanted to hurt anyone. Just loved the feeling. Just wanted to share this. Life is complicated. I don't know what my future looks like, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to try and take my life again that's for sure. I want to be a family man. Have kids. Give them all my love trough good and bad. That's my story. Written straight from my heart. Peace ",1

Trigger warning (DV/SA/mention of SH)

Hi everyone,

My daughter recently turned 17 and it just hit me that it will only be one more year that we are legally tied to her father. I've been counting down the time since she was 3 and I would like to share our story. I will be very honest and won't try to sugarcoat my own stupid decisions along the way. It is a very long story and there is still so much more that wouldn't fit in here, but I don't know how I could make it any shorter. Please feel free to ask me anything. Maybe it can help some of you or give you a little bit of hope. Or just keep you from making the same mistakes. Or maybe I'm [REDACTED_NAME] yelling it out into the void. Here we go.

1997

I met my ex when I was 15, he was 21. He approached me and was very blunt about being intererested in me. I was an angsty teen, lonely, insecure and arrogant and he was challenging and charismatic and his interest in me made me feel good. Nobody was ever really interested in me before. We dated for a while, until his fiancé (that I didn't know of) called me on my 16th birthday out of the blue. 

I had gone out with him and his friends many times and found out they covered for him and one of them must have finally told her. The next day he convinced her that nothing romantic ever happened and I was basically stalking him (while me and my parents were on the phone with them), even though even my parents confirmed to her that he introduced himself as my boyfriend and was in our house many times. She believed him. I couldn't wrap my head around how someone could lie to my face like that, it felt so bizarre. I moved on.

2000/2001

I then met him again 3 years later, he pretended to want a friendship for a while, then tried to get back together with me, got mad when I refused because I had a boyfriend and left my life again for some years.

2006/2007

5 1/2 years later we met again online. We started writing every day and met in person after a month and the sparks were back. The bad memories felt so long ago, we were different people now. We started dating again, it felt like the greatest lovestory ever. He proposed fast and talked about how I was meant to be the mother of his children. I got pregnant within 5 months. He was happy first until realisation hit him, I guess - and he confessed that he was married and couldn't leave his wife for financial reasons. After lots of fights and tears I conceded and decided to play along for the sake of my child, who I already loved so much. She was born in early 2008.

2008/2009

We lived in 2 separate cities and for about two years he visited me every other weekend-ish. He kept telling me that his marriage and his wife were his business to handle and if I would interfere I would destroy everything. So I kept playing along and stayed out of it. He wasn't there when our daughter was born and he left me alone with our newborn child when I came home from the hospital with a flu and a 40°C fever.

He didn't pay child support, he wasn't available when I needed him (because I couldn't call him) and he got angry when I was desperate and burnt out and eventually broke down from the stress of being a single mother to a child with semi-chronic illnesses (she fortunately grew out of it), with no other real family anymore except for my low-contact sister who lives 4 hours away, no support system and no money, so I had to balance work and being there for my sick kid and everything else. I lived in an appartment he owned (bought with his wifes signature on the loan) and he made me pay rent. I basically made minus 500 bucks every month and couldn't even apply for government support because I would have had to name him and he gaslit me into thinking that that would destroy everything financially at that time if his wife found out. He told me to stop complaining about being overwhelmed because others do it too (I also realized years later I most likely had PPD). 

He expected me to be available for sex whenever he came over and didn't really care about my consent (yeah, it only clicked years later what that actually was..). I grew resentful. He became jealous of the new and only (female) friend I had (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] even bi), because we spent a lot of time together, helping each other with our kids.

2010

When our kid was 2 years old, I finally had enough and broke up with him. So then he decided the time was right to finally tell his wife. He came to me, told me he told everyone (including his parents who were incredibly mad at him for keeping their first grandchild a secret for two years) and expected me to jump right into playing happy family, like flipping a switch.

I tried for a while, thinking that that was all I ever wanted and he wasn't lying after all when he always promised we would be together one day. I finally won, right?

As much as I wanted to be happy, but realizing little things started grating on me. Like how now I could just easily take a shower if I needed to when he was there made me realize what he robbed me off. It started to get to me how much easier it could have been. But I decided to give it a try, now that I finally had him. 

He understood that I didn't want to move into a house with him and his parents right away, so he decided we should buy a house somewhere else. He found one he liked, a 1 1/2 h drive away from my job, in the middle of nowhere. I told him I would love to find the perfect place for both of us, but this was not it for me. 

He went absolutely crazy. He started spamming all my email-adresses, calling me the c-,b- and w-word and a liar and many other things. I was at work at the time and completely shocked by the sudden hate. To this day I don't know why this triggered him so hard.

Soon after I found out I was pregnant again. I went no contact after his attacks, but felt obligated to tell him and his tone shifted immediately. I told him I wasn't excited about having another child with him and he told me he would support any decision I would make. After some hard internal back and forth I decided to have an abortion. When I told him after it was done, he immediately switched back to being aggressive, only this time with more direct threats (very graphic violent ideations of what he would do to me, promising to destroy every part of my life), as well as contacting colleagues of mine he had never met and remembered the names of, to tell them in detail what a horrible person I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I unalived his baby. And he broke into my place, just to show me that he could. And then he evicted me from his appartment that I paid rent for.

So I took him to court for harrassment. That put me in more debt, but I got a restraining order and supervised visits at a neutral agency out of it and started to heal a little bit after all this chaos. No direct contact.

Until my sister's wedding a few months later. My kid was a flowergirl and one of the photos was so precious, so cute that I couldn't help but wanting to share this special moment with him. So I sent it to him and we started talking again. He apologized like nobody every apologized to me before. He wrote me a letter where it seemed like he read my mind and really understood deeply all the things he had done wrong. He was so sure I was the one. We decided to try one last time. Take it slow this time. I moved in with him 3 months later, into his house, with his parents. I told myself I wanted to give it one last shot, so I would at the very least never feel like I didn't try hard enough to give my kid a complete family.

As soon as I moved in, he lost all interest in me. He expected me to keep the house clean, cook, take care of our daughter and work, of course. I was the only breadwinner at the time. He was convinced providing the house we live in (that he inherited from his grandmother) was enough and spent his time gaming, doing some shady side business with people I didn't know or doing god knows what. 

During this time we/he used up my entire small inheritance (I got 10k right around the time he evicted me) on his debts and his unemployment. When the money was gone, he wanted me to ask my sister for money and I drew a very hard line. We fought a lot at that time. I worked nightshifts every weekend and stayed with a friend in the city from Friday to Monday, we lived about an hour away and I didn't like driving at night so much. When we got into a fight one evening I told him I wanted to leave. I was in the bedroom, packing. My kid with me. He started shouting, calling me names, mocking me. When I wanted to leave he blocked the door. When I tried to push through, he shoved me hard against the doorframe and I fell and hit my head. I'll never forget my kid screaming and crying in fear. She also still remembers (she was 3). He didn't let me go. He broke me a little bit more that night. I knew I needed to get out, but I didn't know how.

2011

One day when I came back home from work, I found long, coloured hair in our shower and in the bed that definitely wasn't mine. He presented some bs theory to brush it off and I knew something was up, but I knew I needed proof. When I confronted him he tried to gaslight me, called me crazy, saying that I was trying to break our family apart. I started investigating. Luckily (yes, really) one day he got into a little accident with my car and the inconsistencies of how it happened gave me some clues and I ended up finding his AP. I packed my kid and our most important stuff and left the same day while he was out.

When he found out he completely lost it. In a call he jumped back and forth from begging and offering to give me his house if I'd come back to promising to destroy me for taking his child away from him, often mid-sentence, sometimes laughing and shouting and crying at the same time. When I had to return for important documents and made his mother promise he wouldn't be there, he was waiting for me in the driveway with a knife in his hand. I was terrified and refused to enter the house.

I left and got a spot at a women's shelter. Words can not describe how guilty and relieved I felt when the social worker there assured me I could block him everywhere, we would proceed via official channels only and he could not take our child away from me because of that. And they helped me get my daughter into therapy to help her through this trauma. He tried to dictate his conditions to every single person he interacted with and the case worker said she never met anyone so assertive and aggressive and manipulative in her whole carreer, and she was dealing with DV-cases for over 30 years.

2012

After months of fights through third parties and court dates we started coparenting. He still wasn't paying any child support even though he did work at the time. He once told me on the phone that if I'd ever go after him officially for child support, he'd just keep on quitting his job (in our country my application would then be suspended). And when I tried he actually did. He said he didn't want me to have his money after I ruined him and that's obviously all I ever cared about.

So I started insisting on written communication only. He tried to scare/force me into verbal agreements for a while and attacked me constantly in an attempt to gain control back (and I had panic attacks every time I got a message from him), but I stood firm. No more unrecorded 1on1 conversations he could twist afterwards. 

I found an appartment in the city, found a daycare for my kid and found the grey rock method. My mental health was at rock bottom. I was happy to be out, but still scared and had panic attacks. I started having outbursts of uncontrollable anger and got scared of myself. And then I finally started therapy for myself. 

2013

It all calmed down slowly, but gradually and we both started seeing new people. The day he told me he had a new girlfriend (of course he tried to rub it in, thinking I would really still care) was one of my happiest at that time. I was releaved that he would finally focus on someone else and thankfully, that's exactly what happened. I did feel bad for his new victim, but I just didn have it in me to warn her. I had to make sure we were safe from him. 

2[REDACTED_PHONE]

Years went by and he had a new girlfriend every other year. They were all really nice, but never lasted long (he cheated on all of them) and those relationships were filled with drama. On our end we received the random, occasional outbursts when things went to shit in his life, over and over, but he knew I would fight back harder now and so it was all bark, no bite. Exhausting, but managable. 

We developed a routine for our daughter. He had her every other weekend and half of the holidays, but of course there were a lot of last-minute changes from his side, which I usually would agree to, because I had the capacity and I didn't care to be right, I just wanted as little as possible to do with him. Sometimes I felt like a coward, but I just decided to focus on having a good life with my kid with as little stress as possible.

At this point I have to say that the doorframe-incident was the only time our daughter ever saw him like that. Despite his many flaws he did try his best to be a good father for her. Believe me, it is not easy for me to admit that. He read books to her, he taught her how to ride a bike, he took her on daytrips and went to parent-teacher-conferences. He was sometimes a bit strict, but nothing out of the ordinary. And she had him wrapped around her finger. He adored her. I tell you this because I want you to understand why I tried my best to enable an unbiased relationship between the two. Sometimes she was annoyed by him, but overall she knew he loved her and cared about her. I kept his bad behaviour towards me away from her as much as possible. I saw what being abandoned by his dad did to my best friend's son and I was happy for my kid that she could grow up feeling loved by both parents. We found stability.

2019

My daughter started to make excuses and didn't want to visit him anymore. And then she confided in me. Some weeks back, she had caught him cheating on his girlfriend in texts on his phone. He was sexting with some random woman, she read in graphic detail what he wanted to do with her (my kid was 11). And she told his girlfriend and sent her screenshots.

When he found out he grabbed her and screamed in her face. He kept telling her that he could have rightfully hit her in that moment and she should be thankful he was a good enough man he didn't, even though she didn't deserve his restraint. He made her promise not to tell me because it wasn't my business and I would blow it out of proportion and make him the bad guy, as usual. The weekends after he kept repeating his threats to her every time she visited until she finally told me.

Hearing something like that was my greatest fear. I decided to be honest with her and share a little bit of my history with him. Just enough so she would understand that it was not her fault, but that was a very dark side of him she had only seen once before and never directed at her. I then explained our options: 

- taking it to court, making his behaviour public

- trying to talk it out

- grey rocking

We discussed the pros and cons and I made sure to let her know I would support her and fight for her and I would make sure he could never do that again. And we decided together grey rock him. We didn't reach out at all anymore. When he asked her to visit him, I told him she had plans, she was sick, she was invited to a birthday party, she had to study for tests etc. He tried to argue sometimes, but eventually gave up. 

At some point, after a series of rants from his side and trying to manipulate us with ominous threats of self-harm, I told him I wasn't available for that kind of bullshit anymore and he could always send me a letter if he needed something (like oldschool, with a stamp and stuff - he never did) and that I would block him now for good. And I did. 

He did try to use her as a messenger for a while, of course, but I shot that down real very fast. I stabilized financially and finally got a court order for child support. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] debt-free and haven't needed his financial support for years anymore, so all his payments are saved for my kid. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Independent. I'm [REDACTED_NAME].

2025

My daughter just turned 17.

She hasn't seen him or really talked to him in 5 years. She hasn't blocked him, but doesn't engage much either. She has accepted who he is and stays away from him. 

Of course she did some more therapy over the years and has grown into the most incredible person. She is a smart, kind, loyal, funny and bubbly kid. She's happy. She knows what she wants and has the best bullshit detector I have ever seen. She's confident and strong and silly. She trusts me and she loves spending time with me and that makes me so happy and thankful. 

She is the reason I wanted to write my story out for you. She's the best thing I've ever done and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] proud of her and proud of myself. I did it. We did it. We made it out and we found happiness. It was so hard, but it was worth the fight. She was worth every fight.

Sometimes I still can't believe that I really did it on my own, that we are safe and the memories come back. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with these moments. They are not wounds anymore, they are scars that are proof of how much stronger I am [REDACTED_NAME]. Most of the time I'm [REDACTED_NAME] overwhelmed with happiness and grateful for the life I was able to build. I did that! I made it! I found love (for real this time) and have been with my wonderful, supportive and kind husband for years now. My kid and him are best buddies. Life is good.

I want you to know that you CAN get out and have a good life. It may take years and you will keep making mistakes, but that is ok. Just focus on your yourself. You can continue healing. You deserve that. You can get there. Keep going. ❤️",5
1g5wxpg,1729187534.0,2024-10-17 17:52:14,offmychest,"9 years ago, I was going to propose to my girlfriend. Instead, an accident occurred and we broke up. I moved from US to a town in Denmark afterwards. This year, she took a job on the same street as me, but is completely ignoring me. It's really hurting me. ","There is only one person I think can help me find closure on a trauma, but she seems to not care. It sucks, but that is life. So now its time to drop my story here and get it out of my system. I dont know if it will work, but I've got nothing to lose by trying. 

Also, before starting, I want to say that it may sound like I am [REDACTED_NAME] about a bunch of things that I think are unfair, and should not have happened to me, as if the world needed to treat me better. Instead, I want to make it clear that I accept this whole situation was caused by me not communicating my feelings to \[S\] (my ex), and as a result she made reasonable decisions that she thought were best for her given the information that she had.  I understand this now, and I understood this back then as well. I felt hurt and I felt resentment when thinking about her, but it was all inevitably directed inward. I did not blame \[S\] for anything, and always tried to appreciate the silver lining that she was able to be happy without me. When I was with \[S\] I always felt like the luckiest person in the world. And that luck finally got paid back.

So this is not about letting my rage at the world out, or about changing the past to be more fair to myself. This is about accepting my own mistakes along the way with the hope of finally being released from my self-resentment.

***The Short Story***

9 years ago, I decided to propose to my then girlfriend just before she was about to move from one coast to the other. We were both in our mid 20s at the time. However, on the night I was planning to do it, there was an accident that could have killed her, and I delayed proposing to her until I got a chance to fly out and visit her after her move. But that never happened. She believed I did not see a future with her and (reasonably) moved on before I got the chance to tell her how I felt.

I was crushed but decided to let her be. We never spoke again because I never really felt like I got over her, until recently. During this time, I had moved from the US to Denmark. When I finally believed I was ready and looked her up, I found out that 6 months ago she has started a job on the same street as me. She had seemingly coincidentally moved across the same ocean to the same neighbourhood, all in a town I never thought of before I got my job offer here.  

At first I was happy, because I thought it would make starting a conversation easy. I reached out just to say hello and ask what she would think about meeting in person after work or something. Simultaneously, I also reconnected with a mutual friend. It was eventually through him that I found out she wasn’t sure she would ever reply, seemingly because she didn’t understand why I would want to talk after so many years. I wrote one message addressing that, but never heard a thing.

That was weeks ago, and I have not tried to contact her since. The problem is that whenever I am [REDACTED_NAME] town, I feel like I am [REDACTED_NAME] scanning faces just to see if she is there. Before I knew she moved here, there were times I thought I saw her but dismissed it as an impossibility. Now that I know she is here, it feels like anytime I am [REDACTED_NAME] could be the next time I run into her. I feel haunted by a ghost.

***The Novel***

**Background**

There is something that is relevant throughout, but I only figured out recently. I think it is important to state ahead of time, since otherwise some of my thoughts along the way might not seem reasonable/sensible. They may have been stupid, but they had a reason. I thought what I thought and that’s on me, but don’t waste your time wondering why.  

To summarize:

* I have some childhood traumas that can greatly affect my self-esteem. They were not caused by one-off events, but rather certain things that went on for years.
* Under emotional distress, I “freeze” rather than having a standard fight or flight response. My emotions go non-existent and I over-rationalize things as a coping mechanism to deal with the situation. HOWEVER, due to the traumas those rationalizations are from a POV in which I am [REDACTED_NAME] and I “understand” it is better for people to not care about me. 
* I understand all this now after seeing a therapist for an unrelated situation, but I was not aware of it back then, and it made me “understand” some dumb things along the way.  

**The Beginning**

Around 10 years ago, I started a relationship with \[S\]. We were both in our mid-20s, living in the US. I was in graduate school and she was applying to PhDs across the country. After a few months, she was accepted into a program on the opposite coast and decided to go the following year. Due to previous bad experiences, I originally told her I did not believe long distance could ever work. She accepted this, though made it very clear that she would want to try a long distance relationship. (This was 3 months into our relationship.)

In any case, we were inseparable for the 9 months of our relationship, and she became apart of my identity. When time was up, I came to understand I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. Rather than breaking up over long distance, I decided I wanted to ask her to marry me.

**The Proposal Night Gone Wrong**

Before she moved, we made the plan of doing an epic adventure together at the start of her PhD program (shortly after her move). I figured at the end of that trip was the perfect time to pop the question. We were going spend a night in a log cabin that could only be reached at low tide. I was not sure how I was going to propose, but I figured I would know once I got there.

We arrived at the cabin just before the sun went down. She was tired after the hike, so we immediately went inside the cabin, started a fire in the fireplace with what wood was left from the previous occupants, and she decided to take a nap. Before starting the fire, we tried to choose the correct valve position for the chimney to be open. (It was one of those old school stove fireplaces.) After tinkering around with our cellphone flashlights, we seemed confident we got it right. But I guess at the end of the day, it was more of a coin flip… and the wrong side came up.

In any case, while this was going on I had decided where I wanted to propose. On the way in I saw an axe and logs just outside the cabin. I wanted to make a campfire with a view overlooking the fjords and start the conversation. I left her to rest in the cabin and went to go chop firewood, of course also thinking about what I was going to say.

When I got back to the cabin 20 – 30 minutes later, I could see from a distance what was already going on. What should have been a normal red glow coming from the cabin windows was tainted by dark smoke. My memory of what happened next is not entirely continuous, but rather sporadic images laced with heartbreak. From that picturebook, I know that ran up the stairs toward the front door of the cabin. I just vaguely recall running inside and finding her unresponsive, even with shaking. I recall looking at her face and feeling like I had killed her. I recall twisting and turning inside and I started to move her more and more to try and wake her. To my everlasting relief, her eyes finally did eventually open. 

Instead of going outside for a campfire, we just stayed inside and drank strawberry lemonade flavoured tea (funny THIS I can remember) while my panic went away. She didn’t seem to register or care at all, but I was filled with every emotion on the spectrum. In the moment, I even believed that I was bad and dangerous for her, and she would be better off without me. So I didn’t even tell her I was having second thoughts about not doing long distance. I just… pretended nothing had changed and tried to stop feeling like a failure of a partner.

The next day we made our way back toward the nearest big city, then we flew our separate ways the day after that. However, I did recover a bit of rationality and before our flights I told her this could not be the end and I needed to see her again. We decided I would come visit her a month later once she settled in a bit. I figured that was enough time for me to process what happened and figure out what I should do next.  

**Better Late than Never?**

In the meantime, we functionally had a long distance relationship; we texted constantly and had long calls each night we were both available. I started to understand long distance might be able to work with us even without absolute commitment, but I still decided I was going to ask her about marriage when I was going to visit her. Afterall, regardless of the situation I still knew it was what I wanted.

Nevertheless, the week before I was supposed to fly she told me that she just couldn’t do it anymore. She couldn’t handle seeing me again and then me leaving again.  There was so much crying and emotion, I froze up once again and began to “understand” that  she was better off forgetting about me and finding somebody there to spend her energy on. At the very least, I convinced myself it was best for her not think about me for her first semester there and focus on studies and making new friends. She told me she couldn’t even imagine being with anybody else, so I assumed there was no harm in a break to see how things felt.

Officially, things were over, but you know how things go – we continued chatting/messaging frequently. Over the next weeks I could really feel the difference in my life with and without the expectation of seeing \[S\] again. It was like there was no color to anything I could see, nor warmth to anything I could feel. It helped me finally not care about the certainty that I thought I needed for a long distance relationship to work. I was going to tell her then, but then found out her brother was critically injured in a car accident, and I did not want to take advantage of her emotional sensitivity. I knew I could see her again over Christmas when she came home for break, and I decided I would tell her everything then.

**The sky comes falling down.**

There were only a couple of weeks before Christmas when I got hit with the emotional brick. She posted a semi-intimate photo with another guy \[T\] on social media. The internal tearing in my chest that I felt in that moment is something I will never forget. It had never occurred to me she would move on without mentioning that she was considering it. Its not that she didn’t have the right or anything, but I just assumed she would have told me. I brought it up right away, and she confirmed that he was a boyfriend and it was going on for some time.

In the weeks that followed I ended up getting more information from mutual friends \[G\] and \[H\], whom had decided to keep it a secret from me.  They convinced me that she already cared more about \[T\] than she ever did of me, there was nothing I could do, and there was no point in making \[S\]’s life hard from 3000 miles away. My time had run out, and she had moved on. I had to accept that and move on as well.  

I was also told she did not want to see me over Christmas break, and so I tried to return some of her belongings through \[H\]. A miscommunication over one of the returned items led to some further tension, which led to some hurtful statements being made in my direction. When trying to clear that up, she simply didn’t see the point anymore for her and blocked my phone number. I communicated to \[G\] that I would leave her be, but it would help me feel less hurt if she unblocked me. She declined, but said maybe some day she would unblock me, but I never heard from her again.  

In my attempts to move on I decided I had to block her on Facebook. It was not out of malice, but even unfriending her was not enough to have her not show up on my news feed or any search involving a letter of her name, and always as the top suggestion. Through \[G\] I made sure she knew it was not because I did not want to hear from her again.

A month or so passed and I decided to unblock her from facebook and consider reaching out. The first thing I saw was that she was “Facebook Official” with \[T\], and all of her pictures were of them together. Her profile picture was of \[T\] with his arms wrapped around her, which once again started showing up on my feed and searches, so I blocked her again to not have to keep seeing that picture.

**A downward spiral, self-destruction**

Something else that seems to be relatively unique to me is how vivid my dreams are, and how much I tend to remember them when waking up. I would say I remember 2-3 of them after every night, usually waking up after each one. This was often something worth looking forward to, as they tended to be adventurous or interesting. However, this became a problem after this situation.

It was not long until I started dreaming about \[S\] every night – dreaming of us being together and me being happy again. And then I would wake up. Sometimes I would cry. But usually I would just be angry and resent my decisions. Now, I have no problem with having to go through grieving and understood it was normal. The main problem was I could never get back to sleep after my dreams of \[S\]. My heart was always beating too fast. And so, every night I would wake up at 2AM and not be able to get back to sleep until 5 or 6, if at all. I developed an anxiety to the idea of going to sleep, which probably only made the dreams more of a certainty. In the end I started to take doctor-prescribed sleeping pills, not to prevent the dreams, but just to make sure I could get back to sleep after them.

To keep it simple, the medication I was prescribed was Quetiapine. I don’t think it was understood at the time, but it has rather nasty side effects so now it is no longer recommended to prescribe it for insomnia. I ended up with significant heart issues (resting heart rate over 100bpm), which did not go away even after I stopped taking the medication.  

At some point I contacted \[G\] thinking maybe if I could at least get some closure with \[S\] the dreams would go away, but in the end I assumed it would only make things worse. I believed I was damaged trash and I believed \[S\] was happy with \[T\] and didn’t care about me at all. I assumed any conversation would reinforce this and only make me feel worse. (I now understand this was my trauma rearing its ugly head.)

With the regular hospital visits, my PhD not going well, and my unresolved issues with \[S\], I just wasn’t emotionally available. I dated only 2 other women in the 3 more years it took me to graduate, and both for less than a month. (Its not that I did not try, but nobody wants to date somebody regularly visiting the hospital and would eventually move away if he didnt die immediately.)

**Finally, a new location**

I was looking forward to a new start wherever I went after my PhD.

I applied all over, but I also specifically applied to jobs near where \[S\] lived just to find an excuse to reach out to her. I thought if there was a chance of me moving to the area, whatever she thought of me she would still think it’s a good idea to talk about it or something. I did not receive any follow-ups though for jobs in that area.

After a long process, I decided to take a job in Denmark and use it as an opportunity to visit as many European cities as I could, presumably before returning to the US to settle down. At the very least, it was a nice way to take advantage of the fact I was still single.

**Moving On?**

Eventually, I even met somebody and got into another relationship. It had taken over 5 and a half years, but for the first time, things finally felt like they would be okay for me. However, after a period of time, that relationship turned toxic and abusive. I don’t want to go into detail, but I suppose the relevant take aways are:

1. Initially, I stayed in the relationship longer than I should have because I was afraid of going back to being single after struggling for so long to stop thinking about \[S\]. This significantly increased the extent of the (new) trauma after the relationship was over.
2. I realized I finally needed to end that relationship when I started having dreams about \[S\] again. Just like before, I would be happy and content in the dream, but then wake up and feel miserable.
3. After that relationship, I saw multiple therapists for the past few years, inherently due to have some sort of PTSD from the abuse.  This was when I finally started to understand the issues mentioned in the *Background* above.

**Acceptance?**

Earlier this year, I started to wrap up therapy tied to the previous relationship. Beyond those events, it also helped me understand the coping mechanisms within me that led to my communication failures with \[S\]. In particular, it helped me understand my “freeze” response to emotional stress and its role in everything. My therapist and I agreed that my dreaming of \[S\] was also so prominent because my intent with her was uncommunicated (repressed). It was not the magnitude of my feelings that mattered, but rather the magnitude of my desire for her to know how I felt about her.

Things that reminded me of \[S\] stopped causing me pain, and some even brought a smile on my face. I even started cooking dishes that she taught me years ago, showing them off to my bros. I was already considering sending her a message. I seemed to have finally reached acceptance without needing to be with somebody else.

**One Final Delay**

But then I got very sick during the summer this year. This didn’t make me not want to message her, I just was going to wait until I felt better. It was already 8+ years, so what would another delay even change? But my symptoms got worse… and weirder. At some point, cancer (lymphoma or leukemia?) came into the discussion. Initial blood tests came back negative, though I was told those weren’t definitive. Treatments were started for other possibilities, but I continued to get worse.

On one particular night (I was drunk in a rave in the forest), I started to reflect on what I would do with the rest of my time (assuming the worst). Looking forward in time was easy. There were places I had yet to visit and friends I would want to see. However, looking backwards it was clear there was only one person that I wanted resolution with, and that was \[S\]. I just wanted to know that she was doing well for herself, hopefully having found somebody great, and that I could rest easy knowing my stupidity at least did not prevent her from having an awesome life.

**Reaching Out**

I simply sent a facebook friend request, and hoped she would accept or at least message asking me what was up. After a few days there was nothing, which was reasonable. However, I noticed the profile did not have any visible updates since 2018. Worried something could have happened, I finally decided to google her after all these years. 

That’s when I saw it – Her LinkedIn Profile showed that earlier this year she had taken a job not only in the same town as me, but on the same street as me, though across 1 light. In fact, I frequently eat lunch across the street from her workplace, and my favorite bar is right behind it.

I was not ready for *that*.

After the shock, disbelief, and general surrealness wore off, I found myself generally appreciative about the coincidence. I assumed it would make reconnecting at least easy, though what would happen afterwords was something I understood I should not have any expectations about. I did expect, though, that there would at least be a conversation.

Simultaneously, I reconnected with \[G\], whose LinkedIn profile I saw via \[S\]’s. He informed me that he had no idea I had moved here after we disconnected. He said he hadn’t caught up with \[S\] in some time and would do that, as well as check in on how she feels about the development. After a couple of weeks, he informed me \[S\] was uncertain about replying, not really understanding the point after all this time. \[G\] passed along my number in case she had a question to ask, and he suggested I message her with my intensions. I did that (not mentioning the story above).

Oddly enough, within a week my symptoms finally stopped getting worse, and then I started to get better. Its still not clear what the issue was and each doctor seems to have their own opinion on it, but at least it appears to not be cancer.

**Aftermath**

That was about 6 weeks ago, and to my understanding she has not replied to either \[G\] or I since then. I believe she has read my message and decided to ignore it and not respond. I was hoping for mercy, maybe even expecting it, because I thought it would be so easy for her, but ultimately - she does not owe me anything.

**Current: What are my thoughts and why am I here? (Assorted points)**

* First of all, if there is an award given out for having somebody “live inside your head rent free,” I would like to submit myself for nomination.
* I acknowledge that the \[S\] that I know and am thinking about is the one from 9 years ago, not the one that she is today. I do believe meeting the new \[S\] will be invaluable for closure.
* My expectation is that \[S\] has moved to Denmark to be with somebody she cares about. I have no goal to break them up and get back with \[S\]. My brain settled on this fantasy where we meet up, I find out she has a Danish partner that will keep her around long term, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] of being friends with this new \[S\] and maybe her new partner. Its not perfect for me, but it would be a funny way of realizing my dream from so long ago of getting to spend the rest of my life with her.
* I want to get this out of my system and try to move on. Effectively, this is my way of having the conversation without her, and me trying to find out how to release all of this hurt and frustration without taxing my friends (further). Ultimately, I think the best I can do is dispel my tension now, so that if I run into her I can act reasonably, respectfully, and healthily.
* On that note, I do believe running into her is inevitable, and want to just get it over with and see what happens. But at the end of the day, that is just not up to me.

**The Conflict**

This place was finally starting to feel like home for me, but now it feels haunted. I feel the presence of \[S\] whenever I am [REDACTED_NAME] alone through the town. I cannot help but scan the faces of passersby, wondering when I will see her face next and if it will acknowledge I exist, or just smirk and move on.

When I simply try and accept that \[S\] does not want to talk to me, I run into a snag at the point where I have to acknowledge her decisions are based off imperfect information about how I felt and feel now. So I reach some pseudo-paradoxical feeling that echoes: “She would be willing to talk to me if I only I could talk to her.”

By nature, traumatic situations are hard to stop thinking about. I am [REDACTED_NAME] my best, but it just seems to be not good enough in isolation. And so I leave my story here, hoping to get it out of my system. As a bonus, maybe somebody will also read it and sometime down the line not make the same mistakes I did.

1helhsb,1734239157.0,2024-12-15 05:05:57,offmychest,Talking again to my crush after 5 years cured my loneliness ,"Hey all, I need to get my thoughts out or my head will explode. There will be details missed but I'll try my best to describe my situation   
  
I 23(M) am a 4th-year foreign student in the Netherlands. I came there together with my now ex-girlfriend. We broke up more than a year ago but I feel for every person on this globe that feels lonely because I understand your pain very well. I've known my ex since 4th grade. We attended the same highschool(from grade 8-12) and even got in the same class. She showed signs that she liked me ever since 9th grade but I had my eyes on another girl from the same class. I am [REDACTED_NAME] critical of my looks but I can still say that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] average looking, but I have always been on the heavy side of things until the summer before 11th grade when I went down from 113kg to 71(the lowest the scale measured) only by playing basketball every day for 4-5 hours. I wanted to lose all that weight so my crush could finally notice me but that never happened.

Playing basketball every day helped me find a good group of friends with whom we spent birthdays and other celebrations together. I even decided to give my ex a chance, given that her feelings were honest and I was grateful that someone felt that way towards me. She quickly got integrated into our group and things couldn't be better, right? 

I never was the type of guy who could speak about his feelings, I've always tried to be the goofy guy who lifts the mood. We had too many arguments with my ex, especially when we were on vacations with our friend group which eventually led to us separating from the group for good. Details really aren't important for this one. Just the fact that the only actual close friend I had at the time - was my girlfriend. 

I will give some details about my crush because it's relevant, I guess. She sat in front of me in most classes. She always turned back so we could have a talk and we genuinely had lots of laughs and fun times. We chatted online from time to time off school but nothing more. My ex was jealous of her and I had to block my crush and the other girls that I had friendly interactions with(mainly from school), just to show her that my eyes were only for her, and they were. Ever since our first kiss, I fell in love with my ex and didn't want another girl, so I didn't have any regrets back then. One of my last interactions with my crush was before our graduation ceremony where she asked me to attend her birthday/send-off since the dates were close to each other. (In my county we have send-offs during your high school graduation where you would just gather friends/family and celebrate that you graduated). I had to refuse the invitation and the last encounter was at the graduation party - where she asked for a picture.

Fast forward to 3 years, when I broke up with my ex. I wouldn't consider myself an introvert, but I don't like clubbing and it seems that's what everyone is doing. On top of that, my English speaking isn't the best, it's hard to start/keep conversations going. So I can't get out of the loner zone, now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I work part-time as a food driver, I'd say we have fun as colleagues and they are welcoming towards foreigners, but dutch people don't let non-dutch in their closer circle that easily. My study is computer science related and attendance is not mandatory. Even though I work part-time- I can easily do 30 hours a week and I chose not to attend lectures - so no uni friends. I have been here and there at university - but there are already established friend groups. I play video games, but I never enjoyed playing solo. Searching for online communities for my games of interest didn't work much. 

I think a lot about the people I cut ties with, especially when I feel lonely. And the figure of my crush started appearing too often. I still think that if I don't have close friends, that means I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a good person to be around, so I wanted to at least apologize to her.   
  
I unblocked her on Instagram and sent her a follow request that she approved within 10 minutes. My heart was pounding so loud even a deaf person could hear it. I wrote her a long message saying that I should've at least given some explanation before going no contact and I felt guilty for not attending her send-off. I specifically said that I didn't expect anything and that I just wanted to apologize. She saw it almost instantly and was super friendly and understanding towards me. She said that she thought about me from time to time which warmed my heart, knowing that I can mean something to someone, even if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a memory. From then on- we kept on chatting for hours. She asked me about my ex and I gave her the bare bones of the situation cause I cant just trauma dump on the 1st night, I also couldn't trust her completely, because she knows people who took my ex's side when we broke up. 

We started messaging almost every day for the next year. I was at that point where I waited for her texts with excitement, not because I still had feelings, but because she was so supportive of me and showed me that she wanted to be in my life. Eventually, I shared my stories about my ex with her and she shared her love experiences in the past. We got to the point where we would share everything and have no filter about it. I would be her emotional support and she would be mine. Things like this normally keep on for 2-3 months then I expected things to be back to normal but she never stopped messaging me even if I didn't message her first. 

I feel very confused about my emotions, I really want to view her as my sister. Because she was there for me where I needed her the most, and saying that I have feelings for her would be a betrayal. ""I helped you, but you only wanted to sleep with me"". Sometimes she does/say things that melt my heart and I question if I wanna marry this girl or not. 

Just simple sayings like: "" I need to hear you, can I call ?"", ""I can only speak this with you"", or "" Accepting your follow request was the best thing ive done"". She goes to bed before 10:30 every day and one day, when I had a flight back home, due to a railway problem, I had to miss the flight and stay one night on the streets(it was late and I had no money for emergency hotel) - she stayed with me for almost the whole night (until 4 am) and on the next day - she checked when my flight was about to land and messaged me to check it I'm [REDACTED_NAME] home, I only told her the time of my departure.  
  
I try to get back home every 2-3 months and we always meet and have a great time. She always makes plans for ""When you're back"" and she is the thing I anticipate the most when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] home. This is not a call for advice cause I'm [REDACTED_NAME] tons of details and there isn't much to say about this topic. 

Funny how this turned out to be advice for those who feel lonely. I wanted to write this to express my loneliness but talking about my friend and remembering the things she did when I was feeling down - made me realize that life isn't as bad as I pictured it 20 minutes ago.

1gn0rf7,1731122050.0,2024-11-09 03:14:10,offmychest,I cut contact with my brother bc that idiot choose his entitled gf over our mother (who has cancer),"**Note:** This is a repost of my first post ever, that was on another subreddit, with an additional explanation at the end, since I wanted to add more clarifications about my brother and Stacy's behavior

Sooooo, I need everyone to buckle up bc this is gonna be a looong story. I have been fuming for months now and need an anonymous way to vent my frustrations.

I (f, turning 21 soon) was never really close to my brother (m, 19). Maybe it's a siblings thing or the fact that our personalities are too different, whatever it may be, I always felt like he was acting close to me only when he needed help with schoolwork and he basically avoided, ignored or even bullied me when I was ""not useful"". Needless to say, that type of behavior never made me want to be close to him - and I have already made peace with that.

What baffles me, however is the that, despite being super close with our mom (f, 47), sometimes almost to the point of being mamma's boy, he started to be distant and later ignored our mom, despite her getting diagnosed with eye cancer and having her left eye completely removed, just bc his girlfriend was super controlling and honestly, jealous (even tho we are his family and not her competition - but girlie is kinda crazy, what can I say).

Now, I need to add some additional context - our mom is a single parent, she raised us basically on her own, as our father was an alcoholic with a tendency to be violent towards my mom, which is why she divorced him when I was 6, and he died of a heart attack 2 years after that (he was on heart meds before and you're not allowed to drink while being on those meds, so basically he dug his own grave). Our father was never a 'dad' to us, he was almost not present in our lives and just gave us trauma, tho I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure how much of that my brother remembers since he was young (4 when they started the divorce) and mom tried to somehow shield us from abuse, even making sure that I took my brother to a safer place - so in that way he was sorta shielded from all the abuse.

I specifically wanted to mention that bc my mom, tho she tried her best to raise us as good people and to treat both of us equally, always sorta shielded my brother, since he was younger and a ""problem"" child, whereas I was ""easier"" to raise since I mentally matured earlier than my peers, was a lot more self-sufficient and never needed help with schoolwork and such. I even went to high school at a different city (my country's capital city), staying at student dorms and then continued to do the same since I started university - up untill last year at least.

So let's introduce my brother's gf into the story now, let's call her Stacy (obviously not her real name, tho even if I did put her name she would never know since neither of them speak English). Stacy is a year younger than my brother, they have been dating for 2,5 years now (not as problematic in my country and also since they were both minors at the time they started dating, as far as I know, and also bc the difference is like just a year) and have meet through their mutual friends, since we are all from the same village and we kinda went to the same elementary/ middle school (one 8 year schooling institution in my country; followed by 4 years for high school). Both my brother and Stacy went to high schools in a nearby cities, traveling from home since it's like half an hour by bus for my brother and a bit longer for her.

Since begging I wasn't really close with Stacy, as she was complete opposite from me personality wise and also bc I wasn't even that close with my brother and I was at dorms most of the time, coming home like once a month or every two months. Their relationship developed quite fast - they even slept over at her or our family houses not even few months into the relationship. I expressed concerns over this fast development to my mom, since they were both young and this was like second relationship my brother had and he was getting progressively more and more simp-like towards Stacy as time went on.

Now, don't get me wrong, I don't really care about them that much buuut I was concerned bc my brother would spend all the money he earned working part-time and later, after high school, full-time on Stacy, and would also make my mom take Stacy with her when she went shopping for clothes ""to buy her something too"". To me this whole situation seemed to be out of hand since we're not in the best financial situation, and, while my mom never asked my brother for his money or made him pay for our household bills, she never expected she would have to pay for stuff for his gf too. Also, tbh, Stacy kinda struck me as someone with main character syndrome, since her behavior was super entitled - for example, last year when she found out my mom and I went shopping for winter jackets without her (both of us had our jackets for a while and needed new ones, not that it matters since it was never her business to begin with), she made my brother buy her not one, not two, but 4 jackets and a coat for that winter. *This is just one example, I have plenty more but I think this one shows her character well*.

To continue the story, I have to say that Stacy never really liked me and always saw me as a competition (idk why honestly). She would always make jabs at me in every conversation, so I would always avoid talking to her too much, tho that was impossible when she stayed at our house. Then, last year from Sept to early Jan this year, her behavior got even worse and, after a fight over a bed (I'll get to that) that she somehow had on her own, without ever voicing her complaints to me, she made my brother move in with her and her whole family (*very messy family, I would have to talk for days if I started talking about them too*).

Bed thing: *We don't have one house but kinda like two houses next to each other, with like a front and back yard. This 'house' belonged to my late maternal grandpa, who we stayed with after mom's divorce and basically till his death. Now, only one of those houses is heated during winter and we squeeze there to save up on heating. Stacy and my brother would have separate room when they were at our place, my late grandpa's room to be specific (important later) and my mom would sleep in living room area right next to that room. I was at dorm and would only come for weekends sometimes, so I slept on a pull-out couch in the large guest room area that was a bit colder that that main area, which I never minded that much but my mom would always feel sorry to me. Last December I came home, this time to stay, since I left dorm and was gonna travel to uni from home - decision I made since my mom was working and tired all the time, needed help with house and all, and the two of them were far from helpful and, in fact, just made more mess bc they almost never did any housework. Anyway, the day I came back was Saturday, mom and I were tired from the move and, since my brother and Stacy weren't staying over, I just put their beddings to wash, put mine in that room and slept there. Now, I have to say - it's not first time this happened, I was too tired and my mom also wanted me to be closer to her so we could chat and she also didn't want me to have to pull out the couch and basically sleep in a colder room when I had a free bed. No one had any issues with this, this is my house after all - well, no one but Stacy. Apparently, she didn't like that I slept in ""her"" bed. Again, this is my house and again, this was my grandpa's room before he died, meaning he slept in that bed, later my brother slept in that bed, and like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] at some point my mom slept there too. I changed beddings to my own, theirs needed to be washed anyway. She was not there at that time. I truly didn't and still don't see the issue here. And to reiterate, she actually got pissed at me on her own, never told me that to my face, but decided to make my brother move in with her and her whole family and then she texted my mom some vague messages about how she felt ""disrespected"". So yeah, girlie doesn't like me for no reason, got mad at me bc of a bed and decided to just isolate my stupid simp of a brother from his family instead of, idk, acting like a normal person and maybe talking to me if she has any issues. Buuuuut no, that's bellow her.*

So anyway, from Jan to early June this year, my brother was distancing himself from mom and I, which truly hurt mom since she felt abandoned and like he choose Stacy over his own family. In June my brother stopped contacting me and in early July he also cut contact with mom, which was even scummier bc mom went to a different country in May, trying to find better work opportunities. All in all, my mom messaged him a lot to try to contact him to see how he was, but he acted like an idiot and ignored her, which broke her heart a bit.

In mid August, my mom came on a sorta 'vacation' back home while she waited for her work visa papers to be processed and during that time she found out she had an eye cancer. Since it was inside her eye, they decided it was for the best to remove her eye completely and then extract part of it and test if it's malign, instead of first poking it to extract some and making it worse if it is. My mom was obviously shocked, but decided to be strong. She wanted to tell my brother too and, if possible, make up with him somehow, just in case things go bad (both my maternal grandparents died from some sort of cancer, so this obviously made her afraid of the worst outcome).

My, brother, the as--ole that he is, however, was super cold at these life altering news once he heard them. First of all, we had to visit my paternal grandpa and contact my brother through him to arrange the whole meeting. Then he was super cold at the news, despite my mom basically crying in his arms when she was telling him the news. And lastly, even after these news, he still never contacted mom to see how she was.

My mom decided to somehow give him another chance in a way and visited him once more, at the end of Sept, right before the surgery. During that meeting he didn't pay attention to the fact that his own mother is gonna have a surgery where they'll remove her eye, but decided it was the best time to ask if mom can go with him to change his SIM card from mom's to his name, so he can get a new phone, probably for Stacy, since he mentioned she broke hers recently. Mind you, my mom has only recently paid off his phone and also, that phone number belonged to my late grandpa and my brother just took it since it was convinient to use, so my mom rightfully said no, whish just pissed him off and he didn't even listen to anything afterwards.

Yup, that's right - getting a freaking new phone for freaking Stacy is more important than his mother (who btw died on the operating table while giving birth to him and had to be revived) having a lifechanging surgery.

At that point, even my mom realized what an as- he is and decided to just prioritize her health first. She had her surgery, everything went okay and since then she has been at home, resting and recovering while waiting to get results and her first prosthetic eye (she's getting it next Monday and then she'll meet with her doctor, find out the results from tissue analysis and discuss next treatment plan).

The reason why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] more pissed off and decided to vent here is the fact that, a few days ago, my idiotic brother made my paternal grandpa call us and ask if my mom truly had surgery and if he could talk with her (I know that my brother made my grandpa do this since I could hear him and Stacy in the background, instructing my grandpa on what to say to me over the phone). Soooo, the idiot somehow thought my mom was, idk, faking it or smth and only when he heard from the villlage gossip that my mom had her eye removed did he actually believe it. I just told grandpa the truth - yes, she had surgery and no, my mom was not able to talk to that, as at that time she was resting after taking her meds.

I have no words for this poor excuse of a human being, I can not comprehend how he is my brother and honestly, although most of my family, including my mom, say that he only changed after getting together with Stacy, I don't think I could ever talk to him. I don't think I'll ever forgive him for this level of disrespect towards the woman that gave him his life and did his best to raise him despite our shitty circumstances. I truly have no words for this, I just needed a place to rant, I have been trying to hold in my feelings, since I have to be there for my mom rn and I just don't wanna see her sad.

Anyway, this is the shortest version of my current situation, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my mom's surgery went well and hope that she gets better soon. As for the two pieces of s--t that are my brother and Stacy, I just want to not have to talk to them anymore, I have had enough of their craziness.

**Additional clarifications:** I decided to add this, even tho it's gonna make this already long story even longer. However, I want to provide additional context:

Stacy is very, how do I put it, self-absorbed type, but her actions are not limited to just petty comments or using my simp brother. She didn't like me since she knew she's not gonna get anything from me and bc she was jealous bc she wasn't the center of my own mother's attention when I was at home, since my mom wanted to spend every moment she could with me bc at that time I lived at dorm in a different city. She would always try to insert herself into our conversations and make it about her. I never cared to respond, since I saw through her and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a non-confrontational type unless someone pushes my buttons. And she did, a lot, which is why I expressed my concerns to my mom. I said the same to my brother but he didn't care to even listen, so I continued to ignore both of them until she started being that way towards my mom too and her behavior became even worse.

There are many more example's of her having a main character syndrome, including the time she threatened to break up with my brother bc she was jealous of one girl in his class that was appointed to go to prom with him (prom s a grade level event, usually people from same class are arranged together based on number of people in that grade and how many of them are male/ female; my brother actually escorted two girls but she was jealous only of the ""prettier"" one), which made my brother text and call mom, on the night of his prom that was in another city and not where we actualy live (event is made up of like grand exit from school, then they take special busses to the venue and after the event they return to school area, where parents pick them up), to drive there and pick him up bc ""he'll ki\*l himself if she breaks up with him"" (ofc mom didn't go, she just told him to enjoy his night as this is an important event he'll always remember and that she'll pick him up from school when they all return there by bus). He's not sui\*idal, this is just manipulation tactic that he knows will hurt mom's feelings and, honestly, it hurt mine a lot too bc, unlike him, I am [REDACTED_NAME] with depression and anxiety, and I do have sui\*dal thoughts sometimes. So yeah, both of them are shi\*ty people and I wish I could say this only happened once.

Other such events just kept happening: there was the time she got mad bc of the color of my dress; then her wanting to be center of attention at someone else's (my female cousin's) 18th b-day (important in my country bc then you're officially an adult, it's often celebrated like a big event, people get dressed up and basically celebrate that person's b-day in a grandiose way); she also body shamed me basically for being ""too thin"" and commented on my food choices; and etc. I really don't wanna keep going on. The point is - I would get hurt, obviously, but I mostly tried to ignore her unless she said stuff to me directly bc I decided not to engage with her behavior and give her more of that attention that she cares so much for.

However, the thing that def crossed every one of my lines is when she started being bit\*hy towards my mom too, following that bed incident I mentioned above. She texted my mother a lot, and I mean a lot, saying how she's ""disrespected"" and when my mom didn't, idk, apologize to her, she started making my brother avoid talking to his own mother or, when he did, she would watch over him and basically interrupt him or limit the amount of time he spent with mom.

Now, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] saying it's my brother is innocent nor am I defending him in any way, I just find this so scummy. My mom is a really emotional person (sometimes overly so), so this type of thing really got to her. Stacy's behavior escalated to straight up listening to, like in a way overseeing, my brother's calls with mom and one night she even grabbed the phone from his hand and started jelling at my mother, simply bc she mentioned she wanted to see her son and wanted him to move back.

One thing to keep in mind - my mom wanted my brother to come back bc she missed him but she never said anything about making him break up with Stacy. We all sat down as a family once prior to most of this and after bed thing, as always in these like family meetings we were all open, mom and I expressed our concerns (politely and non-confrontationally) to him, but he just stormed out of the house and refused to listen. So even this jelling didn't seem to bother him.

At that point I was over them, like I didn't care for them, like ever, but this has hurt my mom way too much and at this point I just told her to forget it and focus on herself. This was before she left the country and before the diagnosis - after she was diagnosed with cancer she wanted to tell him about it and basically make up, after which the events I mentioned prior happened.

So yeah, this is more of less the full story, I felt like I needed to add all of this bc it adds some layers to this story and also bc I'm [REDACTED_NAME] anxious about mom's upcoming appointments. 

As for the two of them, as I mentioned in the comment I made - I understand that they're young and immature, but I still think that there are some boundaries even kids know not to cross. It's one thing to have your own ideas and goals and move to pursue them, and it's def not the same as disrespecting another human's life, much less your own mother's life. 

And to add bc I know some people like to comment - this is not me saying that all parents are the best bc they brought us into this world, like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not saying that especially bc of our father, however I do think that a woman who loves you so much and who went through so much to raise you should be respected.

I'll finish my story here, since I know that at this point I'm [REDACTED_NAME] rambling bc of my anxiety and bc I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on my meds for a few months now due to my depression and not seeing my doctors since like May (I know it's bad but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my energy on mom rn).",1
1e70zxj,1721386920.0,2024-07-19 11:02:00,offmychest,Vent: I hate that I lost the last years of my childhood  to a predator,"I don’t know what I’m looking for to be honest but after all these years of burying this,  it’s all been coming back out and I’m reliving it every day with no one to talk to about it. Basically, I’ve never told anyone and I just have to get it out. 

I met an online predator when I was 12 years old. He was 16, so technically a kid himself but he knew what he was doing. It started off innocent but he was grooming me the whole time. There was a lot of inappropriate things he would talk to me about when I was 12 that really broke my innocence but it really began to take off when I turned 14 years old, and he was 18.
 He started asking for pictures, innocent at first and then requesting more and more explicit content over time. Then made me feel really bad if I didn’t want to. I feel so stupid for getting manipulated but he used his depression and  would escalate to suicide threats if I didn’t want to send explicit pictures, look at explicit pictures, porn, or do sexual acts, etc. 

He had this way of making it seem like he was okay with stopping the sexual conduct when I would ask to stop, but then he would “go into a depression” that I then had to help him out of, which could only be remedied if I did the perverted things he was asking me to do.

At one point, he confessed to me that he sexually abused a 3 year old because I wasn’t doing what I needed to do to keep him from doing that. He said he wouldn’t do it again if I was giving him love, attention, and sexual favors.

 I was 1) afraid that he would harm another child, and 2) if he made good on his suicide threat, that I would be charged for murder. This belief was cemented when I saw the news break on the Michelle Carter case. I didn’t know the details of the case but it confirmed my belief that I would be held liable if this person committed suicide (Just shows how naive I was). And 3) I felt so much shame that I didn’t ever want my very strict mother to find out so I knew I couldn’t ask for help.


So, I allowed this person to steal my youth in what should have been a fun time in my life. Instead, I was terrorized on a daily basis for SEVEN YEARS. 
I was pretty much a sex slave and he would tear me down about everything. He was ugly but he acted like I was the ugly one. I wasn’t allowed to have friends. I graduated college at 17 but he acted like that was nothing even though he barely passed high school and he didn’t have a drivers license until he was 21 because he kept failing the test. 

I was actually 17 when I realized that the pictures I sent him were classified as CP and illegal. I remember he reacted like he didn’t realize it and was sorry, but I was able to tell he had known the whole time that it was wrong!


Yeah I eventually got out one day, but he made me the bad guy about it of course. And surprise, surprise, he didn’t commit suicide like he had always threatened me with. I felt cheated with that. 
I think the worst part is that after I left him, my mother ended up finding out about everything anyway… FROM HIM. He was calling her to receive comfort over that fact that I had left him and ruined his life. It hurts that she only got his side and I could never say my side. I know deep down, she believes that I was complicit in all this and she’s always says I betrayed her trust. It is partly my fault because I hid the fact I met this person and I knew I shouldn’t be talking to an older boy but I feel like at least when I was 12-17, I was a child and it wasn’t completely on me.

I wish I could say my side after all these years but I’m still so ashamed. I can’t say my story verbally. It just won’t come out. Im afraid that if I were to try to explain to my mother or even confess it to my husband, I could have a mental break down. 
I guess I came here because I thought I was over this, I thought I healed, and I thought I forgave this person. However, I realized that I have a lot of inner turmoil and a lot of my issues stem from this situation. For example, I used to be sweet and kind and now I’m aggressive and angry. I’m ashamed of sex in my marriage, and I feel disgusting if my husband touches me. And I sometimes feel like I hate that person who tormented me and wish I could hurt him!
That’s about it. Thanks if you read this far. It’s my first time telling it 💔

1gdpl25,1730075409.0,2024-10-28 00:30:09,offmychest,Comfort wall (full story),"(First story, written 2022) My childhood comfort wall.

Something has been bothering me lately and I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure how to cope with it. I am a 28 M and I tend to be different. When I was a kid I was diagnosed with adhd, but it's possible I could be on the autism spectrum. I have allot of autistic traits. Well I would find comfort in different places. Small spaces, getting squeezed by something, or flat surfaces. I am [REDACTED_NAME] this way as an adult and do have my comforts. As a kid in my childhood bedroom my bed was against a wall, I would either sleep facing against or back againt the wall. I found comfort in it from 4th grade until I moved out as an adult. When I moved out, my parents moved out of state and sold the house. That was 8 years ago. However for the past few years now I tend to dream about my childhood bedroom wall. It appears in 1 out of 3 dreams. I will either be sleeping in that bed and against the wall, getting that comfort for a brief second before I wake up looking for it, only for it to not be there or I will be entering the house as an adult and find my dad on the couch like he used to do, but I know that the house isn't ours anymore and I will have anxiety. Only to go to the wall, be against it and I will then wake up looking for it. My problem is that the more and more I have these dreams, the more that, that wall because more fantasized. It is making it harder to get comfort out of my own things. I've rearranged my bedroom a few months ago so my bed is against the wall with my left side against it, because that's the side my childhood wall was. I was hoping that when I woke up looking for the wall I would mistake my current bedroom wall for it and those feelings would transfer to that wall. So far it has not worked and I always know. I got alittle obsessive over it and went through my 2nd computer and accounts looking for any possible pictures of this wall. My first computer is my childhood one and is vary old. Probably 2006 or something. So it didn't boot up. It did boot up last year so I still have hope to find more pictures on there. My second computer is old to but more like 2014. I did find one picture of it on a real-estate site but couldn't find much. Sometimes I drive passed the old house hoping that they have the blinds up so I could get a glimpse. I would never get out of the car and try to peak, I don't know who is living there and if they have kids or anything. Peaking through a kids window tends to be a no no in society lol. Plus in those dreams where I am [REDACTED_NAME] the house with my dad but know there are owners, the owners tend to show up, I never see them but the information that we got caught explains as a loud sensory screeching noise and I will paralyze. This has actually kinda made me afraid of the house. In real life when I drive by I have happened to never see people then either. They have a big truck though and somtimes the garage is open. So I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure how to cope with that because I haven't seem that wall in years. Writing this might help. If you are curious on what the wall looks like I posted the pictures on my page. These where from the early 2000s and screenshots from videos that passed the wall quickly, so they are not good quality.

(Second story, written summer of 2024)
Grief that doesn't count
I am [REDACTED_NAME] to tell this story twice, then describe the experience with the pain. It will help people understand. Both stories will sound different, but are the same. You will understand in the end. So my stories are based on the title. 
First story: I was in 4th grade when I met this girl. We where friends and hung out allot. For the first 2 years we where just friends but in 6th or 7th grade we started dating or at least where together. We seen each other everyday. We where together all the way through college and a year after that. 2006 to 2015. 10 years. Known each other for 12. In 2015 we moved and went our separate ways. Now it's 2024 and almost been 10 years since we seen each other. I dreamed about her every 3 nights for the past 10 years. 1 out of 3 dreams is her. If we didn't move. We would be married. Well I found out a month ago that she is gone, passed away. People say this grief does not count. They seem like a holes right? Well the second story tells this story in a true sense. This first paragraph is true, but the details are not.

I have a rare sexuality. It's called objectum sexuality. This orientation makes it so you have emotional and sexual feelings for objects. The girl in the first story was actually my bedroom wall. When I was in 4th grade, we moved to that house and I was in the room with that wall. First 2 years I didn't notice it much even though I am a wall sleeper. (Lean on the wall to sleep) well I hit puberty and that wall was my first crush and lover. I will make a joke with people when they talk about losing virginity. (Them: Who did you lose your virginity to? Me: I LoSt mY VirGiNitY tO a WaLL!!!!) I will say it sarcasticly, in a joking way, but I am [REDACTED_NAME]. It was my first sexual encounter with something I actually found attractive. Well that wall was my lover for 10 years. 
(The days would be tough? At least I knew I was going to get to be with the wall at the end of the day) well I grew up and moved out. Once I moved, my parents sold the house and moved out of state. So now I no longer had access. First 2 or 3 years was fine. But then the dreams started. 1 out of 3 dreams, I would dream I was sleeping with the wall. Then I would wake up and it wasn't there. 

I got a mortgage for a house and lived here for 7 of the 10 years. I have been waiting for the house to go back on the market. I would then sell my house and move in there and have my wall back. The house went on the market every 6 months or so for the 3 years I wasn't ready for it. But stopped when I started watching. 

Well a month ago, the whole town flooded and damaged 75 percent of the houses. I was lucky with mine. But the childhood house got hit. My first thought was the wall. I went and peeked when the flood went down and there was a little water damage from what I could see, at least a foot off the ground. I did try to contact them asking if they had to tare down the walls, if I could take some pieces. I told this story but instead of a sexual orientation, I said autistic comfort object. They didn't respond and a week later I seen they gutted the house. I could see the wall from the street because of the window in that room. I seen the wall was gone and that's when the grief started. 

People say that this grief doesn't count because it's not a person that was lost. Which that's fine if they believe that. I just want to write this story and get it out. I can't talk to them or describe it because it doesn't count to them. 

When I seen the wall was gone I seen glass shatter. Like I actually seen it break. Reality was the glass that broke. It only happened for a second. The grief flooded in and I didn't see or hallucinate the glass after that. I felt the grief the same for 4 days. Cried off and on. It was like the grief when a family member died. But then I had the first dream. One of the wall dreams. I was laying with it in the dream, but then I remembered. Everything turned into the scene of the distraction of the flood and the wall was gone as well. I woke up with a start and just cried there. The grief intensified from there. Got worse everyday until the next dream, where it played opposite. Started with the distraction and reverse to it being there. That one was worse because I had relief that it was ok, to wake up to knowing it's not.

 I went to the house in real life a few days ago after that dream and collected a few full wall panels from the yard (big pile in yard, all the damaged houses had these piles) I made the best guess on which ones might be from that wall. Because if I rebuild one panel. That would be enough for me and I would feel I had my lover back. Well I was looking for evidence that the wall pieces where from my wall and when I was with the panels, the glass shattered again. But the pieces fell away and it was dark. I heard wails of pain in the distance. Almost didn't notice them. I then wondered what the f*** was that and since I realized it was there it got louder until it was to loud and I opened my eyes to realize I was making the wailing. I was grasping the panal and crying. Once I realized it was me I stopped but could still hear the wails as a long lost echo in the back of my head.

I still feel the immense grief, but now I feel scared. It's the type of scared you would feel if you would feel if you woke up in the middle of the night to see a shadow ghost standing in your room crying and it faded away. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of this darkness inside me as I would fear a demon raising out of the ground. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to hear those tortured cries in my sleep the next time I have a wall dream.

There is a guilt to those cries. Like there is a suffering creature that's lost in a dark void that you want to help but can't find. Like if you where to hear a baby crying in the forest, you went to look for it, but could not pinpoint the sound and it eventually stops. Never to be heard or found again. I have all of that as a disassociatied part of me that isn't me but is. And I left them out there to suffer. But it's actually me in the pain. 

I've never valued myself and never done much for me, I tend to run around for everyone and self sacrifice. It's an ocd compulsion to say yes to tasks and complete them. I am a slave to my ocd and others. But now this ocd compulsion wants to help the lost cries within me. Which is the most self love I have ever done.

With all of this, people say my grief doesn't count. I think it counts. It's the most visceral mental anguish I have ever felt. I wonder if I had a mental break for something, I have never experienced anything this bad. This was worse then when my grandpa died. And that still pops up in my head years later.


Update story writing 

I found the evidence that I needed for knowing I picked the right pieces. I have never found any evidence saying the opposite. The side of the wall that lines up with the light switch and where the door is  mach. Everywhere on the wall looks close enough. But the biggest thing that I found, was a part I left out of the past stories. During the flood. I swam out to the house to check on the wall. It was up to my neck in allot of places. I climbed through a window and visited the wall. Figured it was the last chance ever. I touched it beside the door. I was muddy from the swim and I left fingerprints. I thought, (oh shoot, evidence that I broke into the home) I left it though as a final touch. Digging through the pile, I brought home allot of drywall. I had one big piece that I was looking at and I found the fingerprints. I was staring at them for a bit when the second (glass break) happened. I had a second piece that fit with the first. I rebuilt the wall with those 2 pieces. The wall ended up being probably 75 percent of its original size, which was bigger then I intended but actually was perfect. The fingerprints didn't convince me because it could have been a coincidence. Just a marking that looked like it. So after I rebuilt it, and it was ready to be painted, I spent 4 hours cutting out a thin slice from the paint to save the fingerprints. 4 months later I had access to a microscope and I got a close look at them. They matched the pattern of fingerprints. So it was fingerprints, could be a coincidence and someone else's, but at this point it's unlikely. I'd forgotten there was a lightswitch, it was close to the door. There was a rectangle cut out close to the door that i didn't know what was. Thought it could mean it wasn't the wall. But i recently remembered it. The fingerprints where under the light switch. Both on the wall originally and on my panels. So I am [REDACTED_NAME] at a 99 percent chance. The amount of coincidences that would have had to happen to trick me would be to much. Well with all of this. I did the same thing I tried to do with my current houses wall to transfer feelings. Well the feelings just felt as if they continued. I've felt reconnected and devastated at the same time. The dreams of being with it still happen. Except I wake up and it's actually there. The sadness and morning are still there but satisfied each time I am [REDACTED_NAME] it. So I got my wall back. 99 percent and the transfer/continuing of the feelings is good enough.",2
14dztkz,1687232192.0,2023-06-20 03:36:32,offmychest,"Update: I am battling cancer. I'm gay, but I have realized I love my best friend of 25 years (a man). I told him everything and it was the best day of my life. Thank you all.","If you want the original story, it has a similar title. Here is my update. So tonight I told James. I told him everything. Gosh. I just wish I could relive this night over and over again. I've never been so happy.  


He came into my room this evening like he always does. Greeted me, ""Hello, how's my Amumu doing today"". I told him I was doing well. He told me I looked beautiful. Which is NOT true but it still felt so sincere. Then he started unpacking the stuff he brought me today. I asked him to stop and just come sit with me because I wanted to talk to him. He nodded and came and sat down next to me.""What's up?"" He asked.  


It took me a bit to gather myself. I kept getting distracted by his eyes. How he looks at me sometimes, I don't know how to describe it. I told him ""I love you."" and he just kind of laughed and touched my hand before casually responding  ""Oh I know that, I love you too."" In retrospect this wasn't the best way to start I guess since we've said that enough with a different understanding that he didn't get what was happening. He started to get up again to unpack the snacks and I grabbed his arm and asked him to let me finish. He looked confused but he nodded and sat back down.  


And then I did it. I told him everything. I told him about all the times in the past I'd thought about just marrying him despite my sexuality. I told him my favorite memories of him and how they make me feel. I told him he'd always been my best friend and the person I trusted the most. I told him I made a mistake and I should've chosen him. I then basically devolved into reciting the last paragraph of my first post to him -- he's the face I see when I think about feeling loved, the embrace I feel when I think about being safe, it doesn't matter what we do -- if we're together I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and he's the only thing I want for the rest of my life.  


He basically froze. He said nothing -- just looked at me as I spilled everything. I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure he even blinked. When I finished and looked up at him he was sitting there like a statue with his mouth slightly open, still enough it was like he forgot to breathe. James always knows what to say so this was a little unnerving to me.  


I started to ask him if everything was alright but before I could finish his expression broke. He exhaled into a weak but incredibly tender, quivering smile, and he just reached out  and pulled me into a hug. I buried my head in his chest and his arms just wrapped around me. I just melted into him. He was so gentle. It felt so easy. It felt so right. Then he started crying, and then I started crying. He's been coming here through 2 years of cancer treatment and never seen him cry til now. He held me for a while but however long it was it wasn't long enough. He still hadn't actually said a single word since I finished talking but I guess he didn't really need to… then he finally answered my question with: ""now it is"".  


When he finally pulled away, his face was red from crying but he just looked so happy. He looked at me for a bit. It was kinda cute because he had a little trouble maintaining eye contact, which he usually doesn't. He was like a little boy again. Then he finally looked right at me and  he just said ""You are the only thing I've ever wanted."" Then I started crying again and he started crying again and he pulled me to him and held me again. I wish it never ended.  


A little bit later once we exhausted our crying capacity, I showed him the post. He made a few jokes about wanting to meet this ""James guy"" and about how he had better go and thank my mom for her 20 year wingwomanship lol. Then after he finished reading it he kissed me. It felt easy, not scary at all and just… right. He asked me if it lived up to my daydreams and I chuckled and said yes. Then he said ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] so sure myself, I think I need more data"" and kissed me again (he is so ridiculous but this was smooth as butter).  


Then after that we started talking, and I guess he told me everything too. He said he'd loved me since we were little kids. Told me he still has every drawing/letter/kraft I ever made for him in a safe that he took with him to college and has taken everywhere he's ever lived. We talked about the day I came out as gay to him, and how he'd figured it out earlier -- but he struggled to accept it for months in secret because he had lived his entire life up to that point assuming we would be a family and wanting nothing else.  He told me he thought about our last night before college all the time and he kept hoping that entire night I'd say something before he left, because then he'd have transferred colleges to stay with me. Told me he actually took a very long way home just to prolong the time when we were holding hands and I was sleeping on his shoulder and that it was to this day his favorite memory.  


Then he looked at me with those piercing green eyes and said ""For me… there has never been anyone else.""  He loved once (me) and then struggled through a bunch of rebounds and even though he had learned to bury it and move on with life and was happy in our friendship his heart had only ever belonged to me. Honestly I guess I should've known this (My dad told me he was sure this was true before but I didn't listen) but I was flustered (and deeply moved).  I joked that he should enter the Olympics as a torch carrier and he said ""they'd never have a chance i'm [REDACTED_NAME] greatest there ever was."" Awww.  


We sat and talked and reminisced some more, mostly about when we were kids. I found out some things I never knew because he avoided telling me how romantic somethings were for him after I came out, but I also kinda realized… I think they felt romantic to me too. Then he sang me some of ""our songs"" (his voice is so beautiful). We had another embrace and another kiss. Both still felt divine. I can't wait to have my hair back again so he can pet it like he used to when we were kids.  


Then I brought up the sex question, and omg it was the cutest shit ever. I barely got to say anything before he started tripping over himself like ""Look, I don't even care -- I don't need that, if we need mistresses or something we can do that it doesn't bother me, I just want to wake up with you every day."" Which was sweet, but then I told him that even though I didn't know how that would go (and I might not be able to) I wanted to try with him anyway when I got better -- and oh my god he turned tomato red and could barely look at me. Literally could not even manage to form a sentence in response -- just mumbled incoherently before managing to get out ""um, ok, if you're sure"". This man has been married and had 6 girlfriends but he completely just falls all over himself at the thought, god it was adorable. This is the only thing I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a little worried about, but I do want to try. I mean I liked the kissing which I thought was completely impossible. And I know that if it doesn't turn out well it won't ruin anything and we'll still be together and just figure something else out for that one need.  


Then we talked about the cancer. He is so sure I'm [REDACTED_NAME] make it. It's so touching. It took a little while to get him to take the other possibility seriously. When I finally did and I told him that it's the reason I didn't tell him sooner, he held my hand and told me that if that happens -  he'd be ok because he'll always know that he was one of the lucky ones because he was mine. Jesus fucking Christ I almost lost it. Then he said if we don't have that much time left, we better make sure every minute counts. I said ""that's pretty hard to do in a hospital"" and he replied ""what do you mean? We're both here and that makes this the best place on earth."" Dear God, what did I do to deserve this man? I teared up again and he held me one last time. Then the doctors came in. He kissed me goodnight. We both said I love you but it felt so different. It's never felt so good to say or hear those words. Then he smiled at me and left.  


I was so excited the first thing I did was call mom and she was just ecstatic. I think she might be happier than me, which is saying something lol. As soon as I told her what happened and that James and I are together she just started crying and talking about what a good boy he is, how she just knew this would happen and that she can rest easy now because she knows I will always be loved and taken care of. Plenty of her ""destiny"" talk which usually gets on my nerves but honestly I was so happy tonight, fuck it I'm [REDACTED_NAME] board. Maybe it was destiny. I guess sometimes mom really does know best.  


I feel like a teenager again. I never thought I'd feel this way again in my life. I never even imagined if I did it would be for a man. God I love him so much. Now I can't understand what I was ever worried about or why I didn't do this years ago. Thanks so much to everyone who read my story and helped give me the perspective and courage I needed to finally do what I should've done years ago. Now as long as my health cooperates… I'll be one of the lucky ones too, because I am [REDACTED_NAME].

1fdzltv,1726021767.0,2024-09-11 02:29:27,offmychest,overcoming my guilt from past mistakes.,"hello, today i want to share my story so someone may not feel as alone as i have been feeling recently. i am 16 years old and will be turning 17 in a few months. when i was around 5-6 i discovered sex and porn. it was around the time when it was freely available on youtube if you wished to search it up. i had a very close cousin, i am a boy who is gay and she is a girl. we were close in age, i being a year younger than her, so we naturally bonded and were very close. when i discovered this i had no sexual desire or inition, just curiosity as to why it seemed to only be older people and why only they were allowed to partake in this. i don't exactly remember how it came about or how it happened but soon enough i was in kindergarten visiting my cousin and we would partake in exploring each others bodies. it was never sex, and i don't think i ever even touched her. i wont get into the details but we did kiss i think and she did touch me. this eventually stopped this same year and by first grade we had completely moved on. as far as i know we both have kept it to ourselves and we have never brought it up again. i still saw her periodically after that and we always just played and hungout normally. i will mention we only did this stuff when we played ""house"" indicating we knew it was between adults. i don't know if she feels as ashamed, guilty, perverted, disgusting, or even if she knew the impact it would have at the time the actions were done, but i assume she did not. you may be wondering why i am [REDACTED_NAME] this and it's because recently only now have i began to process it. i never knew why growing into my teenage years i couldn't accept affection from my family or physical intimacy such as hugs or cheek kisses. i thought it was because i was just born differently or abnormal. in the past few weeks i have began to realize it is because of this. with this realization came shame, guilt, worry, disgust, confusion, and so much more only those who have been through this will understand. i couldn't for the life of me understand why i thought that was okay and why it only happened with her and never my other cousins or any other close friends i had growing up. i couldn't understand why i was curious when i don't even like girls. i beat myself up over it, let my self worth be diminished to this very experience. i wondered if i had molested her, let my mind run wild and rampant. only recently have i come to understand it was not my fault. it was not my fault i was never educated on sexual exploration and when an appropriate age to began exploring is. it was not my fault i was not born into this world knowing that is not okay to do with your closest family and friends. though it may seem obvious, kids learn through experiences, learn right from wrong by experiencing the wrong. some of you may have known you should never do this with family or friends at a young age, but that is not something i was offered at that age. my parents keep their feelings to themselves, even now we have never talked about protective sex, when is an appropriate time to began exploring sexually, and how to do that and who to do it with. i let my life amount to that experience and the feelings that came with it. i told myself it would be better to die than to feel what i felt, that i had no place feeling guilty and ashamed and disgusted for something i did, wether or  not i knew the impact it would have on me. i found myself resenting my parents and cousin for not knowing better and not immediately shutting it down. but i know that isn't fair. what parent thinks their kid will do this? what parent thinks their kid will stumble across porn at 5 years old? what cousin, who is also just a curious kid, knows it is wrong? now i realize we were kids, kids who did not know any better and were simply just curious and explored that curiosity with each other. our closest companion who we felt comfortable exploring that with. there was no sexual intention, no underlying feelings of attraction, no malice, just childhood innocence and curiosity. i find myself dwelling on this everyday. i pushed it away at first but now i know the only way to get better is to sit in these feelings, letting them come and go without judgement. sure, if it never happened then i would have never been going through this, but in a way im thankful it did. thankful because now i can teach my kids to do better, to allow them a childhood without any sexual trauma and allow them to simply be kids. kids without any knowing of sex and the things they should only know when they began to understand their feelings and bodies more. i will offer my kids something i could not have, innocence. i will allow them internet access but restrict it. i will not allow them to fall into the trauma i experienced. in a way i am [REDACTED_NAME] that i no longer hold resentment, guilt, feel ashamed, feel disgusted, feel perverted because at the end of the day it would have never happened had we known it was inappropriate and wrong. that experience shaped me to be the kind, loving kid who respects peoples boundaries and understands how stuff like this can affect people. it made me who i am, though it was not pleasant and i would take it back if i could. i guess that's the beauty of life, making mistakes and doing better each day. i have so much more thoughts and opinions on this but that is a summary. it felt good to get this off my chest. judge me if you like, say what you want but i feel strong knowing it won't affect me. that no matter how many people will call me weird, disgusting, incesty, etc. i will know it isn't true. i know me better than anyone and will not let anyone take that away from me.",1
1f4sri3,1725016874.0,2024-08-30 11:21:14,offmychest,Closure. Grandparents. I feel weird. ,"I know this post is gonna be somewhat long. And it's my first time posting here.

My story is somewhat unique and weird I guess. But I think many can relate and I guess I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for support.... one way or another...

I'm a 30 year old transwoman. I've been living in fosterhomes from I was 10 till I was 18.  
I was brought up to believe I had a father living in London. Lets call him X. Until my mother called me as a 15 yr old telling me I actually have another father. Father Y - being my real father.

My grandparents was the parents to father X. I never quite understood why Father X didn't come to pick me up from fosterhome. Why did he let it go this far. But my mother telling me I had another father, made me realize why. I was simply not his kid.

When I was 17-18 I told my grandparents. That I knew. That they were not my biologically grandparents. They were afraid I was gonna break contact with them. And they said they didn't know, but that they've been thinking about it. Since I looked nothing like Father X etc. I said to them they will always be my grandparents no matter what. They've been sticking up for me for many times in my life. Weekends, driving me here and there, money etc. They've been a steady ground for me in my life. I don't know where I would ""be"" without them. They've kind of raised me a bit. And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] grateful for what they've done for me in my life. When I was 22 I wrote a letter to Father X. Told him I no longer want to have him in my life. And I wrote the letter to get things off my chest. I was bitter that he did not seemed to care for me. I thought he was my father, yet I was sent to fosterhome etc. I was hurting and that why I wrote that letter to him. I was probably a bit demeaning. But I was getting off everything from my chest. It went unreplied. And the past couple of years I've been attempting to try meet him for a beer or two to make amends. He never seemed to take this seriously, nor cared. So till this day we haven't met. My grandparents knew about this letter and was sad about it. I do understand that. But it was important for me, to get it off my chest how I felt.

From the age of 18 till 30 I've still just viewed my grandparents as my beloved grandparents. Although they were not biologically. But for the last couple of years. I've remarked subtle hints or subtle ways of behaviour from them - that spoke volumes about how they viewed me. There's been a few ""hints/episodes"" here and there. But I'm [REDACTED_NAME] list one as an example.

December 2023. I called my grandmother. Told her I was gonna celebrate xmas at my sisters house. I said I was scared I would have an asthma-attack. Since my sister has this big dog, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] to dogs. I asked if I could come celebrate xmas with them and Father X if I reacted badly to the dog. My grandparents and my sister lives a 10 min carride.  
""Absolutely not. You can not come here."" My grandmother said.  
""Am I gonna spend xmas alone then. I will find that real hard being alone on xmas nipping to wine all by myself!"" I said.  
""Yeah, you could do that. You can not come here."" She said.  
And after that talk I've more or less felt as if they don't view me as their grandchild anymore. Remember. There has been several other instances where I've also felt not ""prioritized"" or ""viewed"" as important as their other grandchildren.

The last couple of years I've visited them once a month. Cutting my grandmothers hair, cutting my grandfathers eyebrows. They served dinner. And sometimes I gave them a bouquet of flowers. They are old. And I only wanted to honor them.

Fast sped up till july 1. 2024 I had a dream in which I asked them if they viewed me as their grandchild.  
I was actually gonna meet them that day. And I decided I would ask them.  
So I asked: ""Ever since I became a woman. Do you view me as your grandchild?"" I asked the question in an easy tone as if it was a completely normal thing to ask.  
""No we do not. We view you more as a friend. We haven't viewed you as our grandchild since you were 17-18. If you were male, I don't even know if we would still be in contact.""  
""In fact, when I go my little trips around the neighborhood and meet someone I know. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] saying I have 4 grandchildren. I say I have 3, and then theres the you and I just say we are good friends.""  
Inside of me I felt devastated and so hurt. I felt as if the whole relationship with them were just a ""lie"".  
Acting as if nothing happened. I managed to think to myself. This is probably the last time I will see them. So I would make the most of it. Just being positive. Give them hugs. And laugh. I managed to put all my hurting feelings aside and just be there in the ""moment"" cherishing them.

Later that evening I felt so icky, bad and drained. I knew why. Because I felt so hurted by her words.  
I was thinking, maybe they are just getting too old now. Too old to function and maybe she never meant what she said. I called her up. Re-asked the questions. Said I felt really hurt by what she said. The same response came. She told me I should grow up. That I had to understand. She kinda apologized for calling me just a friend. She said I meant more to them than ""just a friend"". Although. It was already done. And I was already broken to pieces by her words. I had to hang up. I felt my world just shattering. I've always viewed them as my grandparents despite they are not biologically. But it seems to me that they do not. Although I do believe that deep down at some level they think of me as a grandchild. But that might just be wishful thinking from my pov.

Today it's ish 2 months since july 1st. And it's been a hell of a ride. I've been so depressed. Yet I've started to meditate and try to uplift myself in every way possible. My siblings, my mother and friends are all disgusted by this situation and have a lot of sympathy.  
Today I was actually gonna meet them. I thought of meeting them as a way of ""closure"". But this whole morning I've been shaking and ridded with anxiety. I decided to call them. Tell them I cancel. It's gonna be too tough on me. The tables have turned. And I have to protect me and my inner child. They told me to grow up. That I was a coward. And that it is ""my choice"" if I don't want to have anything to do with them. They just want to go back to how it was before. Me being their friend. They asked me why I couldn't show gratitude towards them despite what has been said and done. They told me I was selfish for not thinking about them at their age.  
I kinda felt that the only closure I will get is making piece within myself. It is nothing they can actually do to give me ""that closure"". I'm [REDACTED_NAME] stay true to myself and not play ""A doll's house"" just for the sake of their age, and what they've done for me. They know I am [REDACTED_NAME] for what they've done for me. I've told them so many times. Almost everytime I've been visiting them. So why is it that they boil it down to this moment for me to be grateful and expect me to ""stick it out"" with them? Is this how it's gonna go. They can tell me whatever and I have to ""stick-it-out"" because they've done things for me I should be grateful about.

I've sorta landed on that I need to heal myself and accept the closure within me. Rather external validation from them. Cause I will never get it I guess.

This became a long post. Sorry. But I could use some love I think. <3 Thank you for reading this.

1f3ay50,1724853633.0,2024-08-28 14:00:33,offmychest,I(21M) was held hostage in my own home by my older sister and her boyfriend(28F) and my mom didn't protect me.,"I have always thought I'd moved past my sister's influence on me. We'd always had a complicated relationship with each other. She'd try to teach me good habits but they just had a hard time sticking with me. Not because I don't want to, I just keep forgetting them. We'd constantly get into arguments with each other and it's deeply affected me growing up so I never had the confidence in myself until she moved out. At times it feels like she loves me but other times it feels like she's abusive towards me. She claimed to have changed her behavior but recently I found out that wasn't completely the case. My mom got stuck somewhere on a business trip without telling me she left in the first place. I couldn't reach her and got worried. Snow storm knocked out our power at the on the same day, I really didn't want to call her but I didn't know what else to do. My sisters and niece were too much for me to handle without her help. At first she was helping us out, I was going to tidy up that day but the Storm knocked out the power the same day. She hates messes as most people would and I tried to make it a habit to keep it tidy. But it wasn't easy for me to do, I was going through some mental problems, and was very depressed about something else I can't remember right now. But she was upset about the mess and that our mom left without saying anything. And so was I. She was helping us genuinely, she even brought us dinner so I decided to not cause any conflicts with her since she dropped everything to help us. After the power came back on the next day she decided to take my first sister and niece to grab my mom my brother and I could stay home. On our own I'm 21 by the way 20 at the time because my birthday just passed. Anyway, but this is where it goes south, she decided to take us to Maryland and leave us their while she gets my mother back home. I didn't want to go but she refused to listen to me. I don't mind a road trip but it was unnecessary for the situation we were in and I couldn't tell her that because she'd get mad at me and get personal with me. The road trip itself wasn't that bad going there but she brought mom there after a day only to take us home immediately after. After that I decided to stand up for myself because she was being rude and nasty refusing to let us go to bed after we got home even though it was the middle of the night. As soon as I told her I couldn't take it anymore she mocked me via text treating me like an ignorant child. It was like as soon as I stopped doing everything she said, I lost the write to be treated like a human being. Then I said she has nothing on me then she said she had everything on me and I'd see real SOON fully capitalized in the text message. My mom told me she was coming back and I calmed down after a while but had trouble sleeping that night. She hoped I'd put up with her a little longer since she was upset, she never really stopped my sister from acting out and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] realizing after the fact she was enabling her bad behavior. The following day is when things went south. I thought she'd leave us alone now that my mom was home, and she would be too upset to deal with me. The following day I was about to go to the store for my mom, but my older sister and her boyfriend showed up right when I was about to leave. I really didn't want to talk with her because my gut was telling me it wasn't going to end well. And I was right, I tried to walk out the door but both of them blocked the door preventing me from leaving. I was so scared she'd torment and intimate me because I refused to listen to her the day before, I tried to hide in my room, but she demanded me to listen to her for once and her boyfriend told me not to run away and my mother forced me to talk with her. But this 'talk' was nothing but her tormenting me for a while. Yelled about how I was not going to be able to take care of myself if I move out and how if I didn't step up and act like a responsible adult, I'll end up being taken away from my mother and put into a potentially abusive foster home and kept saying that'd I'd get into big trouble if I moved into college dorms. And I tried calling her out for standing in front of the door and blocking it with her entire body as if she was holding me hostage and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] now realizing that she was. Again, my mom was doing nothing to stop her, I felt so scared and threatened to the point I couldn't even leave my own house. She said she was blocking the door because every time she tried to force me into a conversation with her, I leave the house to avoid her, and she hated it and asked me how she was childish because after getting all up in my face. I felt like dodging the question but she wasn't giving me a choice so I tried to move her out the way so I could just get the hell out of there, but my mom and younger sister restrained me as if I was going to attack her and she was livid and told me I could just go to jail for what I just did so I decided to call the police on myself which my mom didn't allow and she talked about the time when I was sixteen and she physically attacked me but spun it around to make me seem like the aggressor and she laments how she got in trouble with the authorities. She mocked me for over an hour and mom did nothing to defend me and the only thing she said was that she wanted it to end and my older sister said she was going to start doing visits and if nothing changed this 'conversation' would happen again and she looked at me with the most hateful look she's ever given me and said ""The truth hurts and if you put your hands on me again you're not going to end up in a happy place"" and slam the door and left. Then my mom just gave me back my phone and told me to calm down. I was so stressed out and traumatized I couldn't eat sleep, and I didn't feel like myself anymore and I had to ask my mom to hug me and broke down in tears, usually I don't cry in tough situations, but this practically broke me. I spent weeks having nightmares wanting to kill myself thinking I'm a dangerous person who will attack anyone at the drop of a hat. I spent weeks figuring out what to do and my mom told me everyone was in the wrong only making me feel more insane. I eventually moved out after my summer job was finished and am currently staying with my dad who can't believe I went through something so horrible, sorry if my story seems a little all over the place but only now. Do I realize how messed up this all was, do you think my mother and sister are toxic and do you think I should stay away from them I cut contact with my sister, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I might run into again.Even before this incident my older sister always put me down for things she didn't agree with me on. I was only 14 years old trying to enjoy my day before she made fun of me for enjoying Pokemon and telling jokes and how I wouldn't make any friends and this would continue for years to come. She would act nice sometimes but other times she would be nasty rude and condescending to me whenever I wasn't doing anything she wanted me to do even if I was technically not doing anything against the house rules. She never even apologized for what she did to me and she told me that I shouldn't set boundaries with her and people wouldn't wait for me to be ready to talk and I felt like it was a red flag. She even told me happy birthday pretending she never did what she did and after that I felt sick to my stomach for the rest of the day and had a nightmare that night. Not sure how my mom could possibly think I would want to speak with her after she did that to me and how she couldn't realize that I didn't want to speak with her. I took me months to find myself again and during my time at karate I made friends and when I told them about what happened they made me feel safe with them and I started to realize how much I was shaped to be dependent on her and my mother never gaining the independence I needed to avoid a situation like that so I used my summer youth job to save enough money to get out of New York and I moved in with my dad who I wasn't living with since my parents split up. We don't see each other often because he lived in Maryland and we moved to New York when I was seven and I think she had custody of us. But since I was old enough to leave I decided that I had enough and left. It was sad that I had to leave the city for the sake of my mental health but ever since I got here I never felt more sane. I told my dad what happened and he couldn't believe that I was put into a situation where she held me hostage and verbally abused me with everyone just enabling her. But despite that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] healing from what I've been through and I thought typing it out would help me let go and let it out. Still I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I might run into her one day and get into another situation like that, but I feel safer and the nightmares are happening a lot less now. Dad said my older sister used to be a kind and caring person and can't fathom her turning into what she had become. He hopes things will work out between us but he respects my decision to stay away from her and that felt very validating and I feel less insane than I did when I went to my mom who saw the whole thing going down. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a better place now and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] changes to my life so I can be more independent and take care of myself and now understand what is and isn't healthy behavior in family relationships.

A few of my coworkers will remark that my husband is very attractive sometimes, even the straight guys. Hell even one of my lesbian friends says he is very handsome, and she has never called a dude handsome before. 

After another bit of teasing about “how I pulled a man like that” I sat in our car and thought about it. He really IS out of my league. He is tall, dark, and handsome, and I completely forgot how much muscle he has too. I usually see him as my cutie patootie and just… overlooked how much of a unit he truly is. 

I’m a chubby 4’11 chick, and it got me too wondering why the fuck he put a ring on me. 

I let him know how I was feeling when we arrived at home. He gave me the biggest hug and brought me out for dinner. He let me know that he fell in love with the woman I am, and how kind I treated him, and not my body. He said no matter what I look like, I’ll be the same person he fell in love with. 

I just feel bad. While his little speech to me was amazing, it makes me wonder how many people judge me when we are in public together.

1e5ide2,1721223370.0,2024-07-17 13:36:10,offmychest,"I am grieving the loss of an old lover, but people say my grief ""doesn't count ""","I am [REDACTED_NAME] to tell this story twice, then describe the experience with the pain. It will help people understand. Both stories will sound different, but are the same. You will understand in the end. So my stories are based on the title. 
First story: I was in 4th grade when I met this girl. We where friends and hung out allot. For the first 2 years we where just friends but in 6th or 7th grade we started dating or at least where together. We seen each other everyday. We where together all the way through college and a year after that. 2006 to 2015. 10 years. Known each other for 12. In 2015 we moved and went our separate ways. Now it's 2024 and almost been 10 years since we seen each other. I dreamed about her every 3 nights for the past 10 years. 1 out of 3 dreams is her. If we didn't move. We would be married. Well I found out a month ago that she is gone, passed away. People say this grief does not count. They seem like a holes right? Well the second story tells this story in a true sense. This first paragraph is true, but the details are not.

I have a rare sexuality. It's called objectum sexuality. This orientation makes it so you have emotional and sexual feelings for objects. The girl in the first story was actually my bedroom wall. When I was in 4th grade, we moved to that house and I was in the room with that wall. First 2 years I didn't notice it much even though I am a wall sleeper. (Lean on the wall to sleep) well I hit puberty and that wall was my first crush and lover. I will make a joke with people when they talk about losing virginity. (Them: Who did you lose your virginity to? Me: I LoSt mY VirGiNitY tO a WaLL!!!!) I will say it sarcasticly, in a joking way, but I am [REDACTED_NAME]. It was my first sexual encounter with something I actually found attractive. Well that wall was my lover for 10 years. 
(The days would be tough? At least I knew I was going to get to be with the wall at the end of the day) well I grew up and moved out. Once I moved, my parents sold the house and moved out of state. So now I no longer had access. First 2 or 3 years was fine. But then the dreams started. 1 out of 3 dreams, I would dream I was sleeping with the wall. Then I would wake up and it wasn't there. 

I got a mortgage for a house and lived here for 7 of the 10 years. I have been waiting for the house to go back on the market. I would then sell my house and move in there and have my wall back. The house went on the market every 6 months or so for the 3 years I wasn't ready for it. But stopped when I started watching. 

Well a month ago, the whole town flooded and damaged 75 percent of the houses. I was lucky with mine. But the childhood house got hit. My first thought was the wall. I went and peeked when the flood went down and there was a little water damage from what I could see, at least a foot off the ground. I did try to contact them asking if they had to tare down the walls, if I could take some pieces. I told this story but instead of a sexual orientation, I said autistic comfort object. They didn't respond and a week later I seen they gutted the house. I could see the wall from the street because of the window in that room. I seen the wall was gone and that's when the grief started. 

People say that this grief doesn't count because it's not a person that was lost. Which that's fine if they believe that. I just want to write this story and get it out. I can't talk to them or describe it because it doesn't count to them. 

When I seen the wall was gone I seen glass shatter. Like I actually seen it break. Reality was the glass that broke. It only happened for a second. The grief flooded in and I didn't see or hallucinate the glass after that. I felt the grief the same for 4 days. Cried off and on. It was like the grief when a family member died. But then I had the first dream. One of the wall dreams. I was laying with it in the dream, but then I remembered. Everything turned into the scene of the distraction of the flood and the wall was gone as well. I woke up with a start and just cried there. The grief intensified from there. Got worse everyday until the next dream, where it played opposite. Started with the distraction and reverse to it being there. That one was worse because I had relief that it was ok, to wake up to knowing it's not.

 I went to the house in real life a few days ago after that dream and collected a few full wall panels from the yard (big pile in yard, all the damaged houses had these piles) I made the best guess on which ones might be from that wall. Because if I rebuild one panel. That would be enough for me and I would feel I had my lover back. Well I was looking for evidence that the wall pieces where from my wall and when I was with the panels, the glass shattered again. But the pieces fell away and it was dark. I heard wails of pain in the distance. Almost didn't notice them. I then wondered what the f*** was that and since I realized it was there it got louder until it was to loud and I opened my eyes to realize I was making the wailing. I was grasping the panal and crying. Once I realized it was me I stopped but could still hear the wails as a long lost echo in the back of my head.

I still feel the immense grief, but now I feel scared. It's the type of scared you would feel if you would feel if you woke up in the middle of the night to see a shadow ghost standing in your room crying and it faded away. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of this darkness inside me as I would fear a demon raising out of the ground. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to hear those tortured cries in my sleep the next time I have a wall dream.

There is a guilt to those cries. Like there is a suffering creature that's lost in a dark void that you want to help but can't find. Like if you where to hear a baby crying in the forest, you went to look for it, but could not pinpoint the sound and it eventually stops. Never to be heard or found again. I have all of that as a disassociatied part of me that isn't me but is. And I left them out there to suffer. But it's actually me in the pain. 

I've never valued myself and never done much for me, I tend to run around for everyone and self sacrifice. It's an ocd compulsion to say yes to tasks and complete them. I am a slave to my ocd and others. But now this ocd compulsion wants to help the lost cries within me. Which is the most self love I have ever done.

With all of this, people say my grief doesn't count. I think it counts. It's the most visceral mental anguish I have ever felt. I wonder if I had a mental break for something, I have never experienced anything this bad. This was worse then when my grandpa died. And that still pops up in my head years later.

I could have a solution, I have wall pieces. I am 90 percent sure one piece is of the wall. But my damn ocd can't let that 10 percent go. If I can get the 100 percent confirmation that it is a piece, I can rebuild it on a wood panel and now my lifelong lover is mobile and with me forever ( the wall went through a hard time and major injury that made it lose parts, but we got though it and now is with me because of it) 

I thought about trying to contact the people again to see if they could identify the piece or if they remembered where in the pile that they throw the pieces. I walked by a few times and the guy was outside and looked at me a few times, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] cowardly and didn't approach. I didn't get a response from the note I left before the house was gutted, so I took that as a rejection. It's hard to get rejected twice. I self sacrifice to much and would rather the grief kills me then inconvenience someone by starting a conversation. At least I used to. Now I want to protect the wailing character so I have that ocd guilt that I did not. But my brain goes to that the people would get mad and get cops involved, I get sued for the wall pieces and they take them back and destroy them. They cleaned up the pile today to, so all I have is all I get. So hopefully I didn't chose wrong. I do got a picture of the pile, so I would be able to have them point where the pieces would have been. 

I hope I can just stare at my pieces and find that evidence that gives me that last 10 percent. The grief would turn into relief if I could.",0
1e12dur,1720739052.0,2024-07-11 23:04:12,offmychest,"Who even am I? ADHD, depression, family trauma PT.1","Hey folks,

 I just wanted to share my experience with ADHD and depression growing up. Hopefully someone reading this will be able to relate and I’m maybe I can learn a little more about myself through the process of sharing my story. 

 To add context to my experience, I’m 38 year old man that grew up in New England. 

 I grew up as a middle child, with a twin brother, a sister 2 years older and another brother 5 years younger, who also has ADHD. 

 As babies, my brother and I formed our own language, a condition called idioglassia. According to my mother, we would actually communicate through garbles and baby talk. My brother had no problem transitioning into english, but it was a struggle for me. From kindergarten into I think 3rd grade, I had regular speech therapy at school. I remember being taught basic information like the difference between a nose and your nostrils, and basic sentence structure. 

 We lived in the quintessential american dream home when I was a child. My parents built it when I was a toddler. One of the first houses in a housing development, at the very end of the road. Our lot was massive, maybe 3 acres, adjoining an apple orchard and a forested area where the public works water department was. Throughout spring into fall, there’s a huge hot air balloon culture in that area, and I have many memories of waking up early for school and seeing hot air balloons rising up above the apple orchard. We lived in this home until I was in 5th grade, at which point my father was laid off and he decided it was time to move closer to his mother. This was immediately following the death of his abusive father, so he was hoping this was his opportunity to finally build a relationship with her. 

 My father was distant and cold towards us kids. His father regularly locked him in the basement as a child, chained him to railings for misbehaving, and there’s a story in the family I’ve heard many times: as a small child, he was playing alongside his father who was chopping wood with a double bit axe. His dad lifted the axe up to swing, and on the backstroke, hit my dad in the head. Unremorseful to his own child, all he said was “you shouldn’t have been standing there”, and got up and left. 

 When I was a toddler, the same man, my grandfather, saw me drinking water from the birdbath in the yard while the adults were eating dinner out on the deck. According to my mother, he quietly got out of his seat, grabbed me by the wrist, walked me to his garden shed, closed the door, locked it, and then uneventfully continued his meal. Fucking vile human. 

My mother’s character was the result of being the black sheep/ugly daughter growing up. From what I gathered, she was studious, timid and kept to herself. She grew up in a household where the father was the sole provider. She’s told me plenty of stories of him throwing plates across the room, and uncontrollably destroying the house. I don’t think he was a drinker, just full of constant rage. Additionally, my grandmother constantly accused my mother of being a prostitute for absolutely no reason. These accusations were a constant theme throughout my mother’s entire life. 

 At some point my parents realized there was a problem with me and I was diagnosed with ADD. I was pobably in 1st grade at this time. For some reason I refused to swallow the pills and the nurse at school had to crush it up and serve it to me in a spoon with jam lol. After starting ritalin, I obsessed over dawing. I had a big hardcover nintendo comic book with all the game franchises included, and I would just draw the characters for hours and hours on end. I started noticing that I felt strange on the medication, so my parents just took me off completely.  

Growing up, my mom prioritized music. She grew up playing the piano and clarinet, and wanted her children to follow in her footsteps. My twin received her clarinet, my sister got a flute, and I got a trumpet. Within a year of receiving my trumpet (4th grade), my teacher strongly recomended I quit. This is a story my mom LOVES to bring up. After I washed out, my brother and sister continued with their music, additionally receiving regularly scheduled piano lessons. I was thrown to the side and found myself consumed by videogames, super nintendo specifically. My parents completely gave up on me, and never even tried with my little brother, so our childhood was entirely consumed by videogames. 

 Ok that’s enough typing for now. I’ll write up a part 2 as soon as I have the energy. Thank you to this community for giving me the opportunity to tell my story. I’ve held it in for a long time now, and I’m hoping to get some peace from this.",1
1d3wcne,1717045849.0,2024-05-30 05:10:49,offmychest,I just want to put it out there,"Before you start this is quite long and I apologise for how badly it’s written I don’t really have have an excuse for it. I just want to tell someone what I’ve been through. Be warned I talk about abuse, drug abuse and suicide. This isn’t every thing but it’s what I’ve been writing over the past few days. 


When I was 5, I remember Mum and Dad fighting every night, shouting at each other. One night, my mum screamed at my dad to leave the house. All I can remember is crying my eyes out, begging him to stay, while he told me that it was what my mum wanted. It worked, and he didn't leave.

On my 6th birthday, Dad came home late from work. I later found out that my grandparents missed a London show to stay with me. He didn't even say happy birthday when he walked in, with me and my friends present at the time. This led to a big argument between Mum and Dad, ending with Dad leaving the house despite my tears, begs, and pleas for him to stay. To this day, I probably feel deep down that it was my fault for not convincing him to stay at the time.

Mum met Wilf, a regular at the pub my aunt worked at. He eventually started living at our house. I constantly had to change my attitude towards him, talking badly about Wilf when with my dad, and talking badly about my dad when with my mum.

Dad met his girlfriend at the time, Stacy. Like Wilf, she was a convicted drunk driver. One day, when Dad picked up me and my sisters, we came back to his place to find her drunk. She pulled a kitchen knife on my dad. We had to barricade ourselves in my sister's bedroom, with me helping to keep the door closed as Dad tried to call the police. She ended up barging into the room, causing me to be pinned against the wall and the door, with her holding the knife against my throat while threatening my dad. We managed to get out of the house without any injuries and stayed at my nan's that night.

Wilf left my mum when the money from the divorce ran out. My mum went to the local pub, asked about his ridiculously high tab, and threw a glass at him. She slipped, cutting her arm. He left her shortly after. The day he left, she had a full mental breakdown. In the following weeks, she gave my sister a black eye when she was 7 because she didn’t feel well and didn’t want to go to school. My dad stepped in and had my sisters live at his house. He also started court proceedings to gain legal custody of all of us.

I stayed with Mum through all of this, seeing her through the worst of times. She began using a lot of cocaine, though she would never admit it. I could see it in her behavior: staying up all night, sleeping through the day on the sofa because she wouldn’t sleep in her bed due to the emotion, always blowing her nose with blood in the tissues, passing it off as a “cold,” the sudden bursts of energy, and the sluggish comedown. It’s easy to see now, but I never questioned it because that was my mum.

Now, a year into the court proceedings, with social workers constantly showing up at school to speak to me away from my mum, I lied about everything at home, saying I was completely fine and happy. I repeated her words, saying if my sisters lived with her, everything would be better. Throughout all of this, I let myself be deceived and manipulated by her lies about my dad and herself. Dad won in court. I was waiting outside the courtroom when solicitors and social workers came out to tell me and my grandparents (on my mum’s side) that I would now have to live with my dad. All I remember is screaming at them while crying, ""I’m not fucking living with him!"" My grandparents got angry, my nan cried, and my grandad shouted at them. They finally left, telling me I had a day to collect my things before moving in with my dad.

Things took a drastic dive after this. Mum realized my sisters weren’t coming back, and it made her worse than before. When we got back from court, I just remember being cooped up in the house for days. I didn’t go to school for a week because Mum convinced me that if I went, my dad and the police would be waiting at the gates to take me, and I believed her. I couldn’t sleep, anxiously waiting for a police officer and my dad to knock on the door to take me away.

From then on, she would emotionally manipulate me further, making me feel like my dad was the root of all my problems, telling complete lies about him. I believed her and didn’t speak to him for months. When Mum got really bad, I would go back to ignoring him. I found out later that at this point, he felt at his lowest, and it was my step-mum who convinced him to wait, telling him I’d eventually be ready to speak to him. For that, I feel terrible.

At this point, she started having drastic mood swings because she wouldn’t take her bipolar medication. She would hit me when it got really bad, but most of the time, it was insults about my weight and the fact I didn’t go out with my friends, despite the fact I only stayed home for her. This reinforced the confidence issues I was already having. She would shout at me for minor things. The worst times were when I wouldn’t go to the shop to get her a Mars bar after I had PE last period at school. I told her I would go in a while, not right after getting home. I ended up calling my grandad after locking myself in the bathroom as she yelled, ""Why the fuck did you call my dad? Why don’t you call your one? Oh wait, you can’t, can you?"" She led me to believe he didn’t care about me.

She used to tell me that if I ever went to live with my dad, she’d kill herself. That led me to take a lot of time off school. At the end of Year 10, I had 54% attendance because I believed that if I went to school, she’d do something to hurt herself.

At the time, she also let random people live at our house, people she met through her coke dealer. We had her coke dealer stay at our house for 2 months. Every day I went to school, I worried that I’d come back to find the house taped off by the police, with Mum being arrested for harboring him. I also met more coke addicts through them, people who were at their lowest, having to deal with their problems along with my mum’s.

My best friend J was there to witness it all. He told me every day at the bus stop he’d wonder if I’d show up to school. Hearing that now saddens me because I made him worry like that.

I scavenged for £3 a day to buy something for lunch. Once, I had to beg her dealer for £2 to pay for own clothes day because Mum told me to. Some people say I should have just shown up and said something to the school, but I wasn’t going to do that and potentially get Mum into trouble with social services. She had told me that anything bad I said would have me forced to live with my dad. At this point, I’d rather die than do that. He tried to give me a £20 note, but I refused, saying I only needed coins because I didn’t want us to be in debt to him. I understood how this worked.

He was at my house every Friday night. Mum would buy us takeaway and alcohol, and she seemed normal when they were there.

On my 15th birthday, I had some drama with a kid named Mike (not his real name). He was hanging around with some people I knew in secondary school despite being home-schooled after being kicked out of my school and another secondary school. He was extremely rude and racist to some in our friend group, and I called him out on it. This led to problems between us. It ended with him coming to school on my birthday, brought by what I thought was a friend. It’s one of my two regrets in life that I didn’t knock him out right there. But I couldn’t because I believed that if I punched him, I’d be forced to live with my dad, a thought I dreaded. He ended up breaking my friend group because most of them decided to suck up to a rich kid rather than side with me, or they tried to stay out of it. My friend J was the only one who stuck with me.

This next bit gets dark, so trigger warning for suicide.

At this point, I thought about ending my life. Mum’s mood swings and abuse were too much. I’d lost all but one of my friends. I’d missed so much school I thought I was going to be a failure. I didn’t want to be the son of a monster like I believed my dad was. I planned to overdose on my mum’s medication, mainly her diazepam for depression and bipolar, because she frequently told me she wasn’t taking it. All I thought to do was leave a note saying, ""If you had taken them, this wouldn’t have happened."" I just wanted my mum back, not the person she had become. The only thing that stopped me from swallowing the pills was thinking of Joe and his parents, who were always so caring to me. I thought how selfish it would be to put them through that, as he was the only person who could make my mum calm down and keep me smiling through it all. At this point, I loved Joe coming over. I hate to think of him like this, but J was the only way to keep my mum “normal” as she’d never be nasty to me when he was around. Otherwise, she’d constantly throw insults at me that affect me to this day. I’ve since told him this, and he doesn’t hate me for it. He was just being his normal self, telling me he’d seen glimpses of my mum ### Document Rewrite:

Mum's true nature, and that he understood why I was always happy to hear he was coming over. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to repay him for that.

At some point, I started to see my dad again. I stayed at his place over a weekend, and my sister A stayed with my mum. When I was dropped off, the plan was to have my other sister, R, there too. However, she refused to step foot in the house after the last time she was there, as Mum made her really uncomfortable. But what happened is not my story to tell.

Mum started shouting at my dad to “help me out here.” At this point, she had started dating her coke dealer driver, who got involved. My dad rightfully told him to back off, saying this was about his and Mum’s kids. He ended up fighting my dad, and I broke down. I’d had enough of the torture; I snapped, realizing that staying would lead me down a dark path. I tried to force myself between them and just swung and punched this 6’5"" giant thug. Somehow, it caused him to stop and just look at me. All I could do was push my dad outside. I hadn’t realized I’d been punched in the process until I noticed my coat was ripped down my side and I saw a bruise the next day. I ended up getting a deep scratch from Mum as well, as she clawed at my face while I tried to hold the door shut.

The police arrived, and we explained what had happened. All my dad wanted was for my sister A to be removed from the house so he could take her home. They ended up arresting my dad. They never gave us a straight answer why they arrested him, but then again, emotions and adrenaline make it a bit of a haze. All I have is a video of them cuffing my dad and walking him to the police car. One of the officers had to drive my dad's car home, as my stepmum only had an automatic license and my dad’s car was a manual. My infant half-brother was crying as we got home with my dad missing.

They held him for the full 24 hours. We spent hours trying to find him a lawyer who could speak to him. He didn’t even get a phone call until an hour before he was released, as they didn’t question him until then. The next day, I took the day off school and went with my stepmum to pick up my dad, while my nan from my dad’s side looked after my sister and brother. As we were waiting, my mum and her boyfriend saw me in the car. She started to plead with me to go home with her. All I could do was stare straight ahead as she spoke to me through the passenger window. I ended up breaking down as she went into the police station, while her boyfriend sat on a bench outside staring at us. We realized that they weren’t going to let my dad out with my mum in the station. I still don’t know what she was doing there. Eventually, my dad got released.

My dad and I wanted to press charges against my mum’s boyfriend for assault. This would have led him to prison, as he has a history of violence. But nothing came of it due to a lack of evidence.

Dad got me into school properly. My anxiety was through the roof, often causing panic attacks at school or making me feel really unwell. I tried many times to get out of going, as was a habit of mine, but he’d encourage me to go. He was quite harsh, getting irritated at me being genuinely sick in the morning. I understand now that it was probably just my anxiety and body’s response to get out of school. But he just stuck to the fact that “I’d rather you go and get sent home than you not going at all,” and I definitely understand why he did that.

Due to my lack of attendance, I was very behind in school. When it came time to sit for GCSEs, I had to be moved from triple science, the subject I always excelled in. It was a real kick in the stomach. At this time, I realized the reason for hating my dad was for nothing, and I wanted to try and make it up to him by showing him that I was good at the same things as he was during school, that I had taken the same interest in science as he did. I felt that with them moving me down, I was disappointing him.

When GCSEs came around, I knew it was going to be difficult. I tried as hard as I could, but in the end, I only came out with three passing grades: a combined science grade of 6-7 and a 4 in maths. I failed English and all the other subjects I chose. I had wanted to attend sixth form in my secondary school, but on results day, I was told that the only option would be for me to essentially retake GCSEs. I ended up breaking down as I realized that allowing myself to be manipulated and taking all those days off meant I now had to face those consequences. I felt like my life was over. All my friends would move on, and I would be the kid that didn’t do anything with his life. But my dad encouraged me that it wasn’t over. We ended up going to the local college near his house, and I was told I’d be able to take a forensic science course, the same one I wanted to take at sixth form, along with English classes where I’d retake the exam. I also started working over the summer, as Dad would give me £20 a week for my train to and from college, but anything else I’d need to provide for myself.

Through college, I slowly came out of my shell, making some friends and really getting along with my teacher. He was young and felt more like a friend than a teacher. I think he could see that I’d been through things and wanted to help me work through some issues. He asked me to stay behind after class to ask me if I was okay, and for once, I didn’t lie about how I was. I think it really helped, and I’m glad I’m able to keep in contact with him.

I tried really hard in college, and during this time, I slowly began to see my mum again. She told me that her boyfriend had left her, but she didn’t fall deeper into darkness. She insisted she bounced back, got a job, but wasn’t able to keep it and had to move back in with my grandparents. Although after a year they did get back together, I started to see her still after that. Most of the time, her boyfriend wasn’t at the house, and that’s how I wanted it.

This is when the pandemic hit. Like everyone else, I was stuck at home with online classes. During this time, J and I started to play PlayStation every day, eventually having me play with a guy named L, whom he met playing Overwatch. Over time, the three of us became very close, as L was our age as well, just from the Midlands. Eventually, he had his friends start to play with us, and it became the five of us. I can honestly say they are my closest friends in the world, with some of us going to university in the same city. One of their birthdays was during the pandemic, and we’d talk about actually meeting each other in person. We decided we’d all hop on a Zoom call and drink with each other. Honestly, it’s kind of lucky they were who they said they were.

Towards the end, when lockdown was starting to be lifted, my mum texted me to tell me my godfather was in the hospital and to send him a get-well-soon message. He’d had kidney problems before and would always bounce back, so I did, but with one of my biggest regrets: saying, “Don’t die yet; we still need to have a drink together,” as I’d just turned 18. Then I got a call a week later from Mum, crying and telling me he’d been given a day to live. He’d gotten COVID and was in critical condition. All I could do was start crying, thinking that my last words to him were to not die. I went to my dad, as I hadn’t told him he was in the hospital and he’s not spoken to my mum in tears. He took the phone and calmed me and her down. He ended up passing the next morning, not from COVID but from a line infection from all the IVs he had and his body not being able to fight the infection. I spent the whole day in my room crying that he was gone. I went to college the next day, trying to keep my mind off it, but after my first class, my other teacher stopped me from leaving, asking what was wrong as I seemed distant the whole class. I just broke down. All she could do was ask why I was there, saying I should have stayed home.

His funeral date was announced, and my mum asked if I wanted to come up a day prior to be with his wife and kids, who I’d grown up close with. She asked if my sisters wanted to come as well. A did, but R said she’d come with Dad on the day. On the day, I thought I could be strong for his kids and my sisters, but I couldn’t. I’d always looked up to him the same way as an uncle, and I couldn’t stop crying the second I walked into the church. After the ceremony, Dad was ready to take me and my sisters home. A wanted to stay for the wake, and Mum said she’d drop her home. She never did, and I was angry that she’d use an emotional time to try and manipulate my sister to stay with her the same way she did with me.  but in the end my dad couldn’t go through another long battle and left her to live where she wanted I know she went through struggle living with mum as she was in and out of jobs and her boyfriend leaving her again for good but I just told her that if she needed her brother I’d be there as soon as I could 




There’s a lot of events that I didn’t include because this would be even longer but I got out there what I wanted. I do want to say my life is a lot better but I’m still facing some family issues but overall I’m a lot happier I’m really sorry that this is so long and that I’m not looking for sympathy there are people who deserve it a lot more than I do just wanted to get this out there ",1
lmzqnf,1613688733.0,2021-02-18 22:52:13,offmychest,"I was raped and abused by family, ran away from home, assault and attacked whilst homeless, harassed by police, eventually saved by a girl who loves me even though I have nothing.","I was born into a family that didn't know what love was. My parents were cold and didn't mingle with many people. They kept their lives very private. I was born into an environment where I was very isolated. I was never allowed to go outside or even have friends.

My only view of the outside world would be a TV. I would watch nature documentaries. I used to be fascinated by animals and wanted to be a zoo keeper growing up. My parents stamped on my dreams though. ""You'll never be anything"" I remember my mother saying to me. My dad would also beat me regularly. He'd always have a reason, but looking back they were never good enough for the level of violence he used against me.

My uncle would visit my dad a lot. My parents would let him hurt and rape me. I would scream for help and think they couldn't hear me. Later on as I got older and wiser I realized I was screaming in a silent house. They knew what was happening and just chose to ignore it.

I grew up very angry and untrusting of people. I got sent to school and was very flinchy. I would flinch when teachers moved their arms near me. I remember one asking if things were ok at home and I lied out of fear. My dad had told me to never tell anyone what happens at home because it was private family business. He also said that police would take me away and I'd never see my family again. This terrified me even though my family treated me awfully.

High school was tough. I was failing my GCSE's because I couldn't revise at home. I was still getting abused by my uncle and I hated him. That hatred for him flowed into hatred for my family. Whenever I brought up what happened to my mother she'd slap me. If I brought up what happened to my dad he'd beat me. I talked to someone online and he encouraged me to fight back when my uncle tried to abuse me. I did fight back. I took his advice and punched him. I was like 15, but my punch was enough to cause him to fall backwards. He called for help and then my parents came in and my dad beat me senseless. My uncle raped me when I was too beat up to defend myself.

I lay in bed thinking about the future and I knew I didn't want to live there anymore. It was like 2am. I couldn't leave my room due to there being locks on the door. My father always locked me in and only let me out in the morning. I emptied my school bag onto the floor and filled it with anything I could think would be useful and then I opened my window. I remember feeling so scared encase my parents heard the window open, but they didn't wake up. I jumped out of the window and had major needle stingy pains in my ankles, but apart from that I was OK. I then walked down the street and didn't look back.

I lived my life homeless for quite a while. I would drink dirty water, beg for money and sneak into the back of supermarkets to steal food from the bins. A lot of bad stuff happened to me whilst I was homeless. The first thing to happen was I got mugged and they stole my trainers and bag. That happened about 2 weeks into living on the street. Being homeless was scary. I got attacked a lot. People would beat you up for your money. People would steal your possessions. One person stabbed me with a heroine needle for no reason.

I slowly migrated away from the city and into less urban areas. Places where it's safer, but also darker. I would sleep in a bush that was near to a school field. I had a fence to my back and was sheltered from view and the elements by the bush. I would lie there amongst filth, dead leaves and trash. It was the safest I ever felt whilst homeless. Nobody ever bothered me there.

Sometimes I would migrate into the city to visit supermarkets to get free food from the bins. It was there I was approached by a man who claimed to help the homeless. He seemed genuine and said he wanted to help me. He offered me a sofa to sleep on, said he could wash my clothes and use his shower to get clean. I smelt terrible because I hadn't washed in months. I stupidly got into his car and he took me to his home. He fed me, let me shower and washed my clothes. I was very grateful, but he insisted I stayed the night. I remember trying to turn him down, but he was very persistent. He let me sleep in his guest bedroom. I slept there, but was woken up by him molesting me. I pushed his hands away and pulled my clothes up. I ran and he said he'd call the police and say I tried to rob him if I didn't stay. I just ran back to the bush I was living in and nothing happened.

I was struggling a lot mentally because I spoke to so little people. It didn't help that I was so filthy all the time, but I had nowhere to bathe. When I was begging in the street often the only people who would approach me to talk were police officers, but they were only there to tell me to stop begging. Someone who lived in the house closest to the bush I was living in eventually also found out I was living there and called the police on me. I was basically evicted from my only safe place. They told me to go to a hostel, but they were horrible places to be. Everyone there had no respect for you and would steal your stuff to sell for drug money.

The supermarket I used to visit started putting locks on the bins to stop people going into them. When the pandemic began I could no longer beg because nobody was around to give me money. Police would harass me to go home, when I didn't have a home to go to. They'd threaten fines and tell me to wear a mask, when I couldn't even buy them from stores because they were sold out and I couldn't go into them without a mask to begin with. My interactions with the police were very negative. They're there to protect and serve, but all I felt they did was discriminate against me for being homeless.

I was struggling so much for food I would dig in the dirt and eat earthworms. One woman saw me doing it and offered me food if I stopped. She was a vegetarian and felt sorry for the worms so bought me food instead. She asked me about my story and I told her. I remember her crying and asking me if there was anyone she could contact for me. There wasn't and she asked if I wanted to sleep on her sofa and have a shower. I had been offered this before in the past and it ended very badly, but this time I felt safer because she was a girl. I took her offer.

It turned out she was very lonely and hurting. Similar to me, but not the same. She works as a counselor, which pretty much explains why she was so kind to me. Believe it or not we have a lot in common although there is a bit of an age gap. When I'm [REDACTED_NAME] her company it feels like my pain melts away. I feel safer with her than I'd ever felt with my own family. She helped me when I had nothing and still loves me even though I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. She buys me things, cooks, lets me live rent free. She never asks me for anything other than my company. Sometimes she'll feel very low and I'll make it my mission to uplift her. I guess that's my purpose.

I used to think that every person was bad, but from the moment I met this girl I realized that good people do exist. I never thought I'd be happy. I never thought somebody would save me. My life felt like it had spiraled out of control and would never go back to normality. This is the closest to normal it's ever been.",204
185cgw2,1701116195.0,2023-11-27 20:16:35,offmychest,I broke up with a girl through a social media message because of my religious parents.,"I’m a married man now, and most days I am [REDACTED_NAME] content with my life - but every once in a while, that small, secret part of me that I’ve kept hidden for so long is awoken by a passing thought, a familiar song, or a long-forgotten memory. It’s the part of me I try not to acknowledge, and it acts as a constant reminder of what I destroyed.  
  
I love my wife and I cherish the life we’ve made together. I’ve never cheated on her (emotionally or physically), and I've always done my best to protect, serve and provide for her in every way I know how. Which is precisely why I have tried so hard to suppress these thoughts deep inside me for so long. In fact, I feel as though I may in some way, be emotionally cheating on her right now, simply by writing this all down. But whether I like it or not, it's a part of me - a part of my past. I’m a strong believer that the universe (or whatever you believe in) has a story to tell through us, and I honestly believe that’s what makes existence so magical. Everything that happens to you and I (no matter how small or insignificant) serves some sort of purpose. I love the analogy of a greater power ( the universe, fate, etc.) weaving a great blanket or quilt, and every small connection we make is simply another thread that ties everything around us together. So here’s my thread, my story - and how I fucked it all up.  
  
It all started in college and, despite it being over 10 years ago, I remember it so vividly. I remember catching her stare from across the room. I’m not going to lie about having some sort of “love at first sight” type of epiphany - but I won’t deny a strong, initial attraction to her. There was an authentic kindness in her stare that struck me in a way I hadn't known was possible.  
  
To my surprise, she sat down next to me and we began to get to know each other. We talked about our classes, our majors, and how shit the cafeteria food was until I realized I had already missed my next class.   
  
""Fuck it"" I thought to myself ""who cares about ""English Lit 101"" anyways.  
  
We exchanged numbers, and before I knew it I was walking back to my car (oblivious of the pouring rain) calling my friends with frantic excitement about the girl I just met.  
  
Not long after we were spending every spare moment we had together and texting all the seconds in between. All the anxieties, fears, and uncertainties of life seemed to just melt away when I was around her. I can honestly say that I saw a future together.  
  
She was the only girl I met in that stage of life that didn’t want to change a single thing about me. Other girls I dated always tried to change so much about me - whether it was how I did my hair, what vehicles I drove, the sports I played, the friends I hung out with or the music I listened to. But not her - she just really liked me for who I was.  
  
Now is the part where I need to tell you about my strict religious upbringing - as it will become extremely important to the story.  
  
My parents were *EXTREMELY* devout Catholics, and every aspect of my life was controlled by them in some way or another. I was raised in the Catholic church from the day I was born, and my parents took the religion very seriously. They sent me to a private Catholic school, we would go to church multiple times per week, and I was forced to volunteer in missions activities.  
  
To just get a feeling of how strict my parents were - here are just a few rules they imposed upon me: no alcohol, no secular media of any kind, no swearing, no parties, no dating outside of the Catholic church, and obviously no sex. I had no privacy and no safe space in my life to express myself or find out who I truly was. My parents warned me against the “wicked ways of the world”, and told me that I would go to hell if I fell away from the church. All of this was done under the thinly veiled guise of “love”, but years later I would learn it was more akin to psychological abuse. I don't have kids yet, but if I ever do - I will definately make sure to love and support them in whoever they chose to be with and whatever they chose to do.  
  
I don’t want to weigh this story down with numerous examples of the religious abuse I suffered - but suffice it to say that this was simply the tip of the iceberg.  
  
As you can imagine, I was dreading the day that my parents found out that I was dating someone that they would consider “outside of the church.” The irony in the situation was that she was a thousand times more understanding, forgiving and less judgemental than the “church” family I was raised by. She wasn’t at all what my parents had told me that people were like who were not part of our church.  
  
I was stuck between a rock and a hard place, as I was embarrassed of my family and what kind of bigoted things they would say after meeting her. On the other hand, I didn’t want her to think I didn’t take our relationship seriously, but I was running out of excuses why they couldn’t meet. So after months of struggling with what to do - I chose to give up our relationship to get back into the good graces of my family (who were beginning to figure out I was dating someone.) I chose an abusive family over the girl I was in love with, and you know what the worst part is? I took the coward's way out and decided to break up with her through a social media message because of how ashamed I was. I didn’t even have the balls to talk to her about it face to face! I told my parents I broke up with the girl I was dating and they were so . . . *happy*. They truly did not care how I felt or what I was going through.  
  
The next few months I tried to go back to church in an attempt to reconnect with them, but I couldn't stop thinking about her and what I had done. I would eventually realize how toxic my family was, and I have now broken off all communication with them.  
  
I didn’t date anyone for a few years after her, and as time went on - I truly regretted what I had done. Not only because I missed her and wished we were still together, but because I knew I had hurt her, and instead of reaching out and apologizing - I chose to bury it deep inside me in hopes of forgetting what I had done. This is the biggest regret of my life and nothing I do will ever make up for the pain I caused her.   
  
Mandy, if you ever read this - I need you to know that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] deeply and incredibly sorry for what I did. I did indeed love you, and what I did (no matter how misguided) was wrong. You did absolutely nothing wrong and the decisions I made will haunt me until the day I die.  
  
I often think about the life we may have had together, and it breaks my heart to realize that I will never know what it would have looked like. But I think we would have had a lot of fun together. I can only imagine how much you must hate me (and rightly so) but I hope you find all the happiness you deserve in life. And I truly hope you find someone who can make you a lot happier than I was able to.

15hunlt,1691139358.0,2023-08-04 08:55:58,offmychest,My bestfriend died two months ago.,"My bestfriend died two months ago

As the title says my best friend died two months ago. I (23M) lost my best friend ""Adam"" (24M). You know there was a time in my life where I thought I had been mentally hardened and prepared for anything that life would throw my way. But I've been having a hard time as of late feeling accepted or welcome. To preface I was homeless for about 4 years as a child 6-10 so I never got the ability to develop social skills as a child. I had met my best friend at the age of 10 when I had moved back to my home state with my mother after she worked tirelessly to save enough to move and be around family. At this point I was shy and introverted, when I had met him it was only for a brief period of time where we saw each other at an elementary school before we moved to another part of town where I had transferred schools. It wasn't until middle school that I had remet my then acquaintance.  We had moved into my mother's then boyfriends house across the street. I had seen my friend across the street with all his friends over and had brought up the possibility of me coming over to him the next day. He gave me the goofiest smile ever and put his hand on my shoulder and said next time don't ask just come over. That day I got off the bus and went to his house with him and had a blast. From that day on we would spend the majority of our time together. However at this point despite us being really close and spending lots of time together I always felt like the odd man out in the friend group and generally saw that I was excluded from most events our mutual friends would have or do. There were days i would find out from a mutual friend that he was at another friend's house and I would go over and try to hang out too only to be met with ""go home fatso"" or ""we didn't invite you go home"" which as a child broke me. I found excuses and reasons to exclude myself as I felt at that time I was the spare friend to have for everyone. I know now that the feelings I felt then are because of my MDD. Feelings of worthlessness, being not good enough, etc. So when I was 13 I had prepared a make shift noose and tried to hang myself, I had lost consciousness during this time but I remember waking up to my best friend frantically slapping me awake and doing what he believed to be good chest compressions. After I awoke I had about ten seconds of disbelief before sound had come back to me fully, shock or something of the sort made me deaf for a short period. When it finally came back all I heard was his voice yelling at me for doing something so stupid with tears in his eyes. It took me a second but upon hearing that and realizing I was alive I leaped at him and hugged him the hardest I've ever hugged someone before, and cried into his chest how sorry I was. We sat and talked for a few hours after this about our mutual doubts worries and fears before he decided he needed to get me home, the last thing he did before he left was made me laugh hysterically. My mother was too busy with other things in her life to notice the very obvious bruising around my neck, so I felt as if nobody truly noticed how I could be gone today it felt awful. Despite all that happening life went on. I would sleepover his house frequently as he would mine. We would play all kinds of xbox360 coop games together notably gears of war and borderlands both of which were his favorite series. It wasn't until 15 where me and him were the only friends of our 15 kids friend group stayed in contact or actively talked to each other. So we stayed that way for a long time being each others friend. When we were 16 and 17 we had both became friends with another kid we had met for this sake his name was Zach. My friend Adam already hung out with him a bunch of times and I only met him because I transferred to their classes. Zach and I became friends after I commented how he looked like Bryan Silva, he would at the end of the day ask if id want to come over to his house with him and Adam to smoke some weed to which I agreed cause I was already a pothead at this point. So it was the three amigos until we were 18 where I had transferred out of my school for a trade school. I had stayed in contact with Adam and Zach while at the trade school however because of my MDD and the negative thoughts that it produces I distanced myself from them. After distancing myself I had moved to Florida with my mother after she won a settlement to which this was one of my worst mistakes of my life. I trapped myself in my room in Florida and went into a spiral. Daily suicidal ideations and gluttonously eating my feelings away. While in Florida my mother met her now husband and were married after only 3 months of knowing each other. A racist jobless dead beat father who broke his own wrist after riding a motorcycle he knew the calipers were bad on. 9 months had passed since that accident and the blood boiled between the two constantly where my mother would destroy a TV and replace it or he would get high as a kite on oxy I assume and break shit in the house. For example he broke mine and my brothers bathroom counter, the light fixture to their bathroom etc list goes on. This was during the pandemic so due to me being the most recent hire at a machine shop I was let go and that further spiralled my depression. Until we were evicted, we moved from house to apartment to RV lots. I was working at Texas Roadhouse at the time when I had formally written my suicide letter. I thanked my mom for her tireless dedication to improving our lives however since she had met her husband she has thrown away her career, and ambitions for her life. Cursing the racist deadbeat with vitriol as he had called my best friend the n word on numerous occasions. I had planned to take a knife three towels and a jug of water onto a highway near the RV lots. Where I had planned to lay the towels down as forethought to not scar or to make first responders jobs easier to deal with, the jug to drink from while resting on my knees before ultimately gouging my neck open. However this never passed as I had COVID like symptoms and was subsequently taken to the hospital where I had disclosed to the nurse that I had suicidal ideations. He spoke to me briefly before leaving the room before returning with an administrator who had informed me that they were officially baker acting me. It was 2 am at this point and my mother was distraught waiting to hear about me before they brought her in and explained the situation. It wasn't until 3am that the ambulance that would come and take me to a psych ward. In that ride the emt that spoke to me was a retired army ranger. He listened to my story and my thought process to how I felt. And he held my hand and told me that despite his own troubles he saw himself in me, the doubts, the mental fog, the inexplicable hatred towards oneself. I don't believe in God but this man would have been an angel or saint. He eased my troubled mind. I was in there for five days despite a 3 day hold maximum. The first thing I did when I got out was call my best friend Adam and told him of everything that was going on and while he was at work he stopped everything he was doing to hear me out. He offered me a place to stay and despite my worries he insisted. With 180 dollars to my name a suitcase and a carry on bag I booked my flight back home. There he had cleared a room out for me and told me to stay for as long as I needed and told me to worry about paying him when I was stable. He was my savior for a second time in my life. It's been 3 years since I moved in with him and his parents in a split single home we paid rent on the 2nd floor of. They had their floor and we had ours. We still were big time coop partners being as everyone else stopped talking to us. This past may the unthinkable happened, I was up at 10 playing games when his mom knocked on my rooms door which she never did. When I opened the door she told me my best friend was dead. She had explained to me that the police came and knocked on the door a half an hour ago to inform the next of kin and that he had been hit by a train. I stood in utter shock, disbelief and asked if she was joking. She replied still in shock that yes he was dead. I then called all our old friends in a state of shock to let them know before they saw it on the news. I felt guilty I was envious of them, that they were able to release the pain and sadness they had felt instantly. It took me a week to fully process and be able to finally break down and cry. I have since reconnected with a few friends. Some of which expressed their condolences to me as if they weren't friends with him too. Most came to the celebration of life gathering I held but there were a few who spoke to me and acted as if they didn't know me despite us sharing nearly 6 years as friends. However despite me reconnecting with all these friends I can't help but to feel unwanted or unwelcome despite how some of them have said I've changed for the better from when I was a fat shy annoying kid I was. I ask these friends every other week or if they'd like to hang out some will leave me on read for a few hours before finally replying with "" oh I'm [REDACTED_NAME]"" or the friends who I feel see my messages and ignore them. Though there has been one good friend I've reconnected to Elly she and I were close when we were younger so we've decided that since we both lost our best friend we'd be best friends together. She's great but I don't want to feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] her or clingy so I try to make plans with others before seeing if she'd like to hang out. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] lost really. As if I don't know what to do without my best friend Adam being back home. And some of you will probably ask why so attached. Well basically me and him spent every waking moment together since I moved back since we were both single at the time atleast. It's was a bromance, we both told eachother we were brothers despite him being black and me being white, non blood brothers. I feel adrift and alone knowing he's gone. He was my onw true friend. And despite me and Elly reconnecting and becoming best friends I can't ever replace the bond I had with him. She's my best friend of course but im still relegated to having a single friend and I don't want to be so introverted anymore despite my shyness. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] now but ever word I wrote is true and I feel so horrible still despite the time that's passed.",2
1fmfxl4,1726961636.0,2024-09-21 23:33:56,offmychest,It took me 24 years to realize I was kidnapped ,"As a young child I trusted my mom. Fully. I believed everything she said. After all, she’s my mom. She wants what’s best for me. She loves me more than anyone in the world. 
I never thought this innocent and natural perception would be exploited to the degree it was. 

On my 3rd birthday my father stood waiting for me outside a McDonald’s. He had planned my birthday. A party I never attended. He waited and waited, called and called but she never showed up. Meanwhile, she was getting on a greyhound with me. The passengers learned it was my birthday, I imagined that she probably told them she was escaping an evil man. One passenger bought me a small birthday cake at one of the stops (my mom said). I wonder where that person is. If only they knew I was being kidnapped, and it wasn’t a happy day to celebrate but a day that would change my entire coarse of my life. 

Once we arrived on the other side of the country she entered into DV programs and changed both my name and SSN. Then she began to fill my developing and innocent mind with her grandiose lies. At 3.5 years she told me she **saved me** from my father. That he was an evil man who was physically and emotionally abusive. She told me he molested me. And if I ever met him that he would **kill her** and take me to Africa where my family would rape me.

 By this time my infantile amnesia had kicked it and I forgot everything up before this point. I forgot my dad. I forgot what he looked like. I forgot our bond. I forgot that I was a daddies girl. I forgot that I couldn’t sleep without him. Yet, even though I had forgotten him there was an intuition that led me to begin to becoming VERY misbehaved purposely toward my mother. I felt rage towards her but I didn’t know why.  That’s when the physical punishments began. Daily spankings. Biting. Fingers being bent back. Trauma symptoms kicked in. I began to wet the bed (something I didn’t do anymore even at this young age), night terrors about witches and running away became regular by 5 years old. Then the hallucination I saw of a demon telling me to kill myself. I gathered knives under my bed not fully knowing why but knowing I should listen to this presence in my room. How does a baby already want to die? It was because I was dying. Then, I was dead. 

My old self with my old name was gone. And instead in its place was a traumatized and angry shell of a child. Not knowing the old me would remain a member of the cast in my mind forever. Screaming to be let out. To be free. To be allowed to be me. I hated the person she forced me to be. I hated myself. 

My mom met her new husband and told me to call him dad. I did for a few days and something felt wrong. I stopped and for the rest of my life she would refer to him as “your dad.” She pressured me to take his last name. She told him I was so misbehaved because she didn’t punish me cause she felt bad I didn’t have my dad. When the reality was I was punished so often I grew to see her as an enemy worth fighting. Once he arrived in my life the physical punishments became less frequent and he became the one to punish me. Much more level headed, he would normally ground me. I would often take my frustration out on him saying “Your not my dad!” 

Time passed and I did petty things. Like stealing makeup which earned me a year long grounding. Eventually everything was removed from me. My phone, TV and computer and any devices and I was told I can have them back when I buy my own. Realizing I had no positive reinforcement to behave anymore by my teens I had basically “defeated” my mom’s punishments. Going out and not coming home for days. Drinking. Having sex. My mom wasn’t interested in my life. She only shamed me for my deplorable actions. Regularly calling the cops on me for petty things like drinking and smoking. Time after time I would feel the suicidal rage come back, I would think to myself “I just want my dad” not knowing who I was even wanting. Not knowing that these were forms of covert abuse masked as discipline. 

I became the “problem child” she would gossip about to anyone who would listen, telling them how mentally ill I am [REDACTED_NAME] how hard it is as my mother. In trouble again and again, “How could you after everything I’ve done for you? I risked my life to keep you safe. You’re a psychopath just like your dad. Soon you’ll be 18 and you need to find somewhere else to live because I’m moving across the state.” 18 creeped up and I felt the fear of abandonment coming I knew I had to do something or I would be in the street. The day after my birthday I was kidnapped by a stranger on Craigslist claiming to have a room share. He raped me. Come to find out, he was a serial rapist and there were others. While the court process began I found a roommate a friend from high school. My mom step dad and little brother were gone, they rarely called. 

I felt safe to start to look for my dad. I found him on Facebook and messaged him. This is where the suspicion began. He told me he has been looking for me. That he loved me and was hurt every time my birthday came around. He was so hurt that he told people I died because he couldn’t explain my mom took me every time someone asked where I was. He was shocked when I asked him about her allegations of rape. His wife and new daughters defended him saying your mom is absolutely lying. 

He bought a ticket for me and my bestfriend so I wouldn’t feel alone. Meeting him was a beautiful memory filled with happy tears. But the suicidal rage, bad behavior became too much for him and he got me a ticket back home writing me off as being “like my mom”. 

No one was with me in court when I faced my rapist. **NO ONE** . He got 56 years the only justice I ever had. (Someone told me I should include his name as proof, I don’t feel obligated to prove my story is true that’s not why I shared it I literally just wanted to get it off my chest but just for the heck of it and because I love exposing abusers and rapists his name is Jose Omar Ortiz in OR if you want to read the news article.) 

 2 years passed before we both apologized to eachother. He told me that was his biggest mistake and he would forever be sorry. A apology? Very weird. My mom had never apologized to me for anything. I felt so seen and validated. Our relationship remained distant but he was supportive. Helping me many times I was in a financial crisis or abusive relationship. My mom was never willing to help me. I learned to not ask for help or tell her about my problems. 

The opposition of their conflicting stories created cognitive dissonance that I couldn’t settle. It drove me crazy not knowing who the crazy person is. It has to be at least one of them, someone is lying. But I made excuses for my mom and wondered if maybe she was right and my dad had fooled me. I was scared to confront her I didn’t want to victim blame sold I was wrong. Because if I was wrong that meant she was abused and a victim herself. I had no memory so how can I tell? 

But their behaviors told a story I couldn’t ignore. I never felt loved by my mom whereas my dad had empathy for me, he was interested in my life and helped me when I needed him. Qualities my mom ALL lacked. My boyfriend told me it’s obvious who is wrong. The more I studied her behavior I seen consistent manipulation patterns: victim mentality, guilt tripping, blame shifting and then love bombing. All classic narcissistic traits. 

It has been 9 years since I met my dad. Only a few days have passed since I realized my mom kidnapped me. She was the crazy one all along. She abused me psychologically, emotionally, physically and neglected me. That realization is so overwhelming that I feel nothing but emptiness. I can hardly cry. 

Why is this my life? A life she curated FOR ME. 

A few days ago I went no contact. I blocked her on everything. She barely speaks to me yet her response was to call everyone she knows I know and ask “why did she block me I can’t figure it out” as if my people are her resource for information. 

Now I’m looking into finding a lawyer. I’ve been educated that there is no statute of limitations for federally kidnapping children across state lines. Since it is between multiple states it would be an investigation by the FBI. I don’t want to punish her, I just want acknowledgment of her disregard for my life. 

I struggle mentally, I can’t focus. I have issues sleeping. I overthink and overcompensate. I have had an evil voice in my mind that tells me to kill myself as long as I can remember. At first I wanted to punish her and then it became because life is so unbearable. The confusion drove me mad until I finally realized. 

All I ever wanted is a family and a home. So I have no practical dreams or career aspirations. I just want love. I have to rebuild the person I was born to be. I hope to become someone who inspires others like me. 

She changed my name, took away my family, my culture, my identity. She killed me. I will never be who I was meant to be. But I know I am [REDACTED_NAME] a mentally ill troubled person but a person who was psychologically abused, who has empathy for others, who deserved a chance a peace. A chance she took from me. She took my true destiny and identity away from me. Something I will never get back. 
One filled with family, love and compassion. One where I would be validated and valued. One without abuse. 

She took all of that, she erased an essential part of me. But she can’t take my soul. I know the truth now and I know who I am. 

For those affected by parental alienation, kidnapping or narcissistic abuse … I know your pain. I’m with you. You aren’t alone. 

They can kill who we used to be…

***…but they can’t take our souls.***

I told my parents I wanted to meet him and when they expressed that it wasn't a good idea, I used his age as a defense. *face palm*","I literally said or basically to this extent ""he's not even a teen. He's a grown mature man so it's all good!"" I cringe every time I think about how stupid that statement was.

Also I wanted to explain that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a male. I saw some people thought I was a female which I can understand why. I just wanted to put it out there that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a guy.  
Also and you're going to shame me for this but I actually did go through with meeting with the older guy. I defied my parents and met up with him anyway. Luckily nothing happened and it actually went pretty well. Not saying I'm [REDACTED_NAME] what I did. Just that I was one of the lucky ones. I did however stop meeting with him after a while after he started showing some unhinged moments cause he has had a drinking problem and he tended to get pretty short tempered when drunk.",5158
wkrwvp,1660119651.0,2022-08-10 08:20:51,offmychest,My mom was never crazy and it took me 25+ years to realize this,"I just wanna share about my mom. For almost 20+ years, I was a daddy's girl and my mom was this crazy, abusive person to me who frequently yelled and threw things around. When my dad left her and had another family, I was still on his side and firmly believed everything was my mom's fault for being such a crazy wife that no wonder dad could not tolerate her.


Years later, I moved out and my mom and I have been slowly rebuilding our relationship. She doesn't have a quick temper anymore or raises her voice. She listens to me often and is always there for me and my siblings. It's like a dark cloud left her and she finally had the time and energy to love us.


A few more years and everything finally clicked. My mom was never crazy. She was a working woman practically raising 3 kids by herself. She did most of the chores, grocery shopping, attending school events, planning parties, checked our grades, and supporting my dad's business. She was also the one who disciplined us kids because dad was the ""fun parent"". I now realized all he did was give us money but all the physical and emotional labor of the household was carried by my mom. She was never crazy. My dad made her crazy. She was dealing with all this plus my dad's affairs which we kids did not know about until years later. She was alone and felt like even her kids were not on her side. I still regret it to this day that I didn't open my eyes sooner.


Now, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] even biased when I say she is so damn beautiful. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my mid- 20s and she looks younger than me at first glance. She has gotten into fashion and dresses up so stylishly. She frequently goes out to brunches with her girlfriends and does community work. She is so loved that random people in her life send her food and gifts often. She is blooming. She's been blooming since she left my dad's shadow. She was never crazy. She was a strong woman who was crumbling but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] she found her wings again. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that I didn't realize this sooner.


I plan to make it up to my mom and take her on mother- daughter trips. I regret acting resentful to her in my youth. I hope I do a good job of showing how much I appreciate her.


**Edit:** I don't excuse my mom's behavior. I forgive her for them. Some of you want me to persecute my mom for making terrible mistakes. I guarantee you, she has been punished enough for it. She has already apologized to me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] one who hasn't yet.


**Edit2:** Thank you for sharing your stories. I have read every one of them. I hope we all find peace, whether we choose to forgive our parents or not. All choices are valid since everyone's journey is different and there is no same answer for each person. I hope we all heal.",7121
u2rd16,1649859475.0,2022-04-13 14:17:55,offmychest,When I was 17 I killed a man,"5 years ago while I was driving home I ran a guy over and killed him. I was driving home and then a guy dressed in garbage bags rolled into the street I tried to hit my brakes when I realized I hit something but it was too late. The guy ended up getting stuck under my car and I dragged him 30 feet. It happened at night near a gas station and they came out and called the cops and the gas station had a jack they lifted my car but it was already too late he was already gone by the time help got there. It was a trail of blood from where I hit him. I was so scared I cried so much. The police searched around the area I hit him and they found a back pack it it had the guys ID and a suicide note to me. Well to the person that killed him it said “I’m sorry, the was the only way I could do it and go through with it”. I didn’t get in any trouble at all because the guy used me to commit suicide. I’m 22 now I’ve been through a lot of therapy but I remember everything from that moment They lifted the car and tried to pull him out. Like his stomach just torn open and his neck and head twister. I only stared for 3 seconds before I jerked my head away but it feels like I looked for an hour with all the details etched in my head. I just always think why did he choose me ya know. Why didn’t he just shoot him self or overdose on drugs.",7833
hcaiu9,1592606602.0,2020-06-19 22:43:22,offmychest,My Canadian experience as a Black man,"I had a pretty traumatic childhood with lots of abuse in the home. My dad was an alcoholic pastor in the black community. When I went to his church as a kid I could feel the anger around me. When I went to church with my school it just didn't feel the same. My dad was passionate and furious and I felt all of that ""passion"" when we were at home. My parents are both from the Caribbean and grew up with children being seen not heard. When I did speak up and out of turn, I got beat. After the beating if I cried I got told, ""I'll give you something to cry about if you don't keep making so much noise."" so I learned fairly early on to be careful around the house with what I said.


At school, it was different. I guess I learned bullying from home because I railed into kids from grades 1-4. I kept getting in school suspensions and detentions which didn't really phase me. When I hit grade 5 however things got a bit different. At that point we had just got a new Principal from Jamaica and she was on my ass constantly. I remember when she would see me in the office she let out a huge sigh, and would ask me what the hell I was doing here again. During that year I got into a fight with a white kid, and we got called to the Principals office. In front of the other little boy, she seemed less animated than she normally would be in telling us off. She gave us a weeks detention, and then told the other boy to go back to class. For me she wanted to have a few more words.


""You are going to Juvenile hall. Next year you will be 12, and with that skin tone and that attitude you are going to be in and out of bars until you end up dead. And I know you are smarter than this. You could do better!"" I sat there trying to understand what was being said, and I looked up and she just looked so disappointed. I can't remember all the things she said, but for the first time, I saw myself in a different light. I felt bad for being less than what I could be. I didn't want to be a statistic. I'm 11 years old and my life is over? She told me to study hard and excel. She really reached me that day, but the lesson wasn't complete.

I stopped fighting, but when I got into high school I realized a bit more of what being black is like. My dad left us when I was in 10th grade, saying he was just too angry and didn't want to end up beating my mom (what about me???). My mom explained to me why she thought he was so angry. In the early 80's my dad was nearing completion of his CPA designation and quickly climbing the corporate ladder at his company. Once he was made Controller however, his boss and stakeholders in the company let him know that nobody with his skin tone was going to be promoted any further. So he quit and started his own business after meeting my mother, and when that didn't work out so well he started to drink and became resentful. Hearing that story about my dad helped me to not become the next generation of angry black man.

A year later, I met a girl and just completely fell in love with her. We talked constantly about our future and getting married... everything seemed so bright, until she dumped me. I pushed her for an explanation, and after a lot of prodding she told me that her mom found out I was black. She was given an ultimatum, dump the boyfriend or be disowned by your family. I was completely distraught, and some of those childhood trauma's popped back up and I fell into a depression. Just before high school ended I managed to cobble together the courses required to get into my University of choice and managed to get in. Still depressed, I almost dropped out, until I remembered in therapy the words my principal had told me so long ago. I can be better than this, I have a bright future and I can reach out for it. It took me until I turned 25 to make it through my degree, but after a few years in the work force I am [REDACTED_NAME] the same point that my Dad was at when he quit his job so long ago. And now with all of this shit happening in the news to my people I need to share my story.

It gets better! I met an amazing woman just before graduating, and we got married a year later. I'm 28 now and I just finally got a grasp on what it means to be black for me. When I was growing up I knew lots of black people who struggled because of the color of their skin. I heard some people say black is beautiful, its powerful, but I never really felt any of that given what life had been like. But I think it is. I would not be who I am [REDACTED_NAME] without my black history, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] of it. Blackness in North America is marked by racism, but we get to define who we are in our response to it. 

TLDR: Through my black elementary school principal's warnings I was able to correct course and become someone I can be proud of today",145
1kw0as6,1748280710.0,2025-05-26 17:31:50,offmychest,I was castigated on the parenting sub just because my disabled wife and I wanted our son to attend a school dance with her. The comments were nasty and ableist still bother me. I have now realized that how ableist and cruel people,"UPDATE-note to everyone i know most people think im in the wrong to feel the way I do and I’ve stated in posts that we are going to let my son dictate his own terms when it comes to his relationship with my wife. If he doesn’t want her around for events outside the home then we will comply with his wishes. 

PLEASE DON’T GIVE ME ADVICE ON MY SON AND/OR THE DANCE. THE DANCE ALREADY PASSED AND MY SON AND WIFE DIDNT ATTEND. 



My wife has ALS and is ventilator dependent and in wheelchair. We do our best to live a normal life and do many of the regular things other families do.  We have two sons 15 and 12. Her disease and disability has impacted them and caused various issues. Both will be starting up therapy again (we had to take breaks for logistics and school reasons)

There was a mother/son dance at my 12 year old son’s middle school sometime back and my wife wanted to attend and my son didn’t want to due to embarrassment.

I posted on the parenting sub and was pretty much castigated for posting about my situation and how my wife and I wanted my son and wife to attend the mother/son dance.  The consensus was mostly that I shouldn’t make my son attend the dance with my wife. I allowed my son to decide and he said no.



Many of the replies in the thread in the parenting sub were cruel and nasty. One woman said that my “wife was death following my son around”. People made nasty comments  saying that a disabled or high needs parent shouldn’t be taken to a dance. 
People inferred  that my son’s embarrassment was justified 
Basically people in that thread don’t believe that my wife should  have some of the same things/experiences that other moms do 
because of her severe disability and illness.


I’m still hurt that most people just view my wife as burden and embarrassment to my son",434
121axfd,1679719485.0,2023-03-25 04:44:45,offmychest,I'm not okay,"I've never been good at expressing myself or how I feel due to the stigma and outlandish nature and severity of some of my issues. But in the short 19 years I've been alive, I've never told anyone the things I've done, or the things others have done to me in an attempt to take them to my grave. But seeing as I outlived the life expectancy I imagined, I figured typing it out would allow me to let go of it and feel better because I feel horrible. So, without further stalling, I think I'll just hop into it, starting at the beginning.

When I was little, I lived a life similar to what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to now. Alone and fairly lonely, the few friends I had were due to being more well-adjusted or, at the very least, less fucked up. In addition, one of my friends was the child of my mother's best friend, and we were about the same age. The earliest memory I have is when I was 4 years old and something I can't remember happened. I was upset about something, and my mom left me in the room to cry while she went and played with my friend. While this situation has little relevance today, I think it's a good example of the catalyst that drove my behavior all through my life to what it is now, mainly my relationship with my mom, along with others we'll get to later.

My mother was not the nicest to me, and as I grew older, I would learn how much of an understatement that was. So skip forward a couple of years due to my memory and the irrelevancy of them to the story. Basically, I was a normal-ish kid with a few friends here and there who occasionally got in trouble, for which I almost always got my ass kicked, but who didn't? Jumping back in at around 9 years old, I was in the third grade, probably my favorite year in school due to having met my best friends and getting along with most other kids. The abuse had already taken hold at this age; I was already pretty apathetic to most feelings and never smiled. It was so noticeable that when I finally did smile, a girl at lunch pointed it out like she had seen a unicorn. But I wasn't depressed; I was just angry and didn't know how to express myself.

As a result, I got into more trouble, some of it BS, some of it not, such as my music teacher sending me to the principal for mouthing curse words while quietly talking to myself. In my defense, I wasn't talking about her; I was all the way in the back and didn't know the ambiguous individual could read lips. In fifth grade, I had a female teacher and her assistant whom I disliked because the teacher, in my opinion, was a dick and her assistant would constantly misinterpret what I said as if I were speaking Japanese. She asked me for a paper, and it being a round table, I didn't want to bend all the way across the table to slide her the paper. So I slid the paper gently across the table, and, as anticlimactic as it sounds, the paper slowly made its way to her, and she did not even attempt to grab it or stop it. Instead, she let it fall on the floor and claimed I ""threw"" it at her. I got sent to my homie at this point, the principal (she wasn't my biggest fan either).

These two incidents led to some of the worst ass beatings I've received at this point in my life. I would later come home to my mom, who is about 2.5 times bigger and stronger than me, and she was furious. I was punched in my chest and thrown into a stool on the ground, followed by a merciless beating with a belt, and left alone to stare at a wall, wallowing in my sadness. I think I could have handled the physical abuse, but the most damaging was the mental and verbal abuse. I would be forced to strip down to my t-shirt and underwear and stand at the door for hours. while she faked phone calls to my relatives, telling them to come get me and that I'd be leaving, before telling me to go sit down. I was constantly threatened with my life if I didn't comply, told I was a worthless ""father less individual"", etc. I would yell and scream so loudly that apparently our neighbors could hear it, which led to DCFS being called.

How it was explained to me was that the lady next door was crazy (even though we knew her kid, who was like 2 years younger and went to the same school), and the DCFS agent would take me away to a horrible place, a foster home. My mother told me that if that were the case, I wouldn't be placed with my other family members; nope, straight to the government. She came in my room a week before the agent to ""warn"" me of the dangers I might face if I snitched on her. She made me watch an hour-long documentary about people who were abused by the staff of foster homes, drilling into my head that if I ended up there, the other kids would pick on me and steal from me. That the staff would repeatedly molest (she had a weird thing with this one; I was asked about it every other day if ""someone was playing with my butt"" completely unprompted from 3rd to 6th grade) me and my toe would be eaten by mice as she claimed happened to my cousin (apparently he needed his toe graphed back on but I never confirmed this with him).

All of this terrified me, so when the time came to nut up or shut up, my nuts retracted back upstairs, and I most definitely shut up big time. Unable to process my emotions, they started manifesting in anger, which led to me being excluded from certain events at school like the outdoor fun day. I had to stay inside while everyone else played. The principal told me that she was going easy on me, and had she been following the rules, I'd have been expelled from elementary school already (I did get suspended though). When it came time to visit the middle school near the end of the year, I had to beg them to let me go because apparently my reputation preceded me, and the middle school principal knew who I was and asked me not to come because of my behavior. My mother had an overwhelming amount of control over my life and others that I would only learn about when I was older (she was responsible for me being in the same class as my best friend 3rd through 5th grade and making sure they served food I would eat on an out-of-state field trip so I wouldn't starve). (It's not really negative, but it sets the tone for how it would soon turn negative.)

Sixth grade rolled around, but this time I got to stay with my great-grandmother in the south. The entire time away from my mother and I improved significantly; I made a lot more friends (probably because of southern hospitality) and overall had a good time (trust me, it was an oddly cool school with equally cool teachers) except for a couple other issues that came with living with my grandma. I returned the next year to mom and a new middle school. All that progress from earlier, yeah, went straight out the window almost immediately. My anger had subsided, and what was left developed into a deep depression and resentment for people, my mom included. I thought people were worthless, making friends useless, so I went out of my way to avoid most people for the longest time. Until I succumbed to my social urges and made a few friends by avoiding the lunch room and eating in one of the science classes with some kids I had other classes with. During this time, I was reluctantly in ""therapy"" (I had been there since elementary, just talking to social workers, but nothing came of it until now).

Trouble would always seem to follow me; anytime a message was relayed from the school to mom, it almost guaranteed an ass beating. I would seemingly get in trouble for nothing, and my teachers would unknowingly be sending me on my way down death row to meet the executioner. Once I got in trouble for ""throwing"" another paper. I didn't realize we needed it and put it in the recycling, but the teacher saw it and told me to keep it, so I put it under my seat, and it fell through the bars of my chair basket while I wasn't looking, and she was mad at me for it. I also told my math teacher to ""stop harassing me"" because every 5 minutes she was hounding me about completing some work I had no intention of doing. That mistake was damn near fatal because, for some reason, I wasn't allowed to feel harassed, and telling my teacher that was apparently way out of pocket. I should also mention I had good grades up until I eventually began failing them.

All of this leads to more violent abuse. I was shoved into a wall, which hurt my arm so bad I needed an ice pack (and had to lie to the nurse about why I needed it). The next day, I was repeatedly hit with a broom, picked up by my collar, and slammed into walls before being thrown on the ground. The physical pain would subside in hours, but because what was done and said to me never left, I would almost always be left to sit and stare alone with my thoughts, and because of this, my mental state would degrade rapidly. Nothing else could bring me to tears like the pain of the person responsible for your entire life, who was supposed to love you unconditionally, constantly tormenting you. Her words would pierce and sting, while the same thing said to me by anyone else would roll off me like water off a duck's back.

Unable to escape the constant beratement, and depending on the severity, this would send me into suicidal spirals, and when I hit emotional rock bottom and couldn't feel any worse about myself, it was the only thing I looked forward to and all I thought about for months. When people asked me, ""NT (Me), what are you going to be when you grow up?"" or ""NT, you're getting older. Have you thought about what you're going to do when you reach x (usually 18+) years old?"" I had no idea, no answer. In my mind, living to be older than 16 seemed impossible. They were right when they said time would fly by. Back at school, the stress was getting to me. During a random game of Uno, I broke down and expressed some of my feelings, along with the fact that I was almost getting my ass beat with random objects on a weekly basis.

This ultimately led to no improvements in my life, just more people in my business. The process of them trying to help was akin to getting a law passed, full of procedures and red tape they had to follow because there was no physical evidence—I had no cuts, bruises, or wounds they could see. All they had to go on was the testimony of an emotionally disturbed preteen. They recommended I be placed in a mental hospital. I stayed after school while they called my dad to pick me up, and the car ride was silent until we arrived at the hospital. He asked, ""Do you want to go in?"" I said, ""Yeah,"" and he couldn't figure out why he said I had it easy as a child. Because all I had to worry about was school and I had no bills to pay, I shouldn't have any reason to kill myself. I was essentially overreacting to him. So we went home.

Because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to enter the next arc of my story. I'll share some extra fun facts that aren't directly related to the story, but I'd be remiss if I didn't. Our principal told us we had too many students for what the building was originally intended for. One day, while walking up the narrow stairs in between a crowd of kids rushing for their lockers, I was knocked over and trampled. I had at least two feet up my ass, one in my back, and one on top of my head, and I couldn't get up because no one could see me. Not long after, a teacher had to stop them from walking up the stairs so I could get up. When I got to my locker, the person whose locker was next to mine casually mentioned the trampling, and to be honest, it had only happened 30 seconds before, so I was pretty blown when she said that (I looked at her like, yeah, ambiguous individual, that was me y'all were just stepping on) and I told her, ""Yeah, that was me."" But let's not forget the time two of my classmates were fucking around playfighting and threw each other in such a way that the dude kicked me in the face. I sat in the same spot on the wall while waiting for my teacher, and, believe it or not, lightning does strike twice, because they were fucking around again and kicked me in the face in nearly the same way. This was an advisory class we had only once a week, and to make a long story even longer, I learned not to sit next to that wall anymore. 

I began high school at the age of 14 and remained largely unchanged during this time. I still couldn't talk to anyone and dealt with the stress of going home to my mom, which significantly impacted how I behaved and how my grades would turn out at first. I had almost all A's before spiraling downward; at that point, I stopped caring what others thought of me and did whatever I could to make myself feel better. I would sleep in hallways on the floor, skip class, and do little to no work. I couldn't concentrate and wasn't worried about the consequences of my decisions until I graduated. The food in my house would run short, and my mom always told me if I ate it all before she went back to the grocery store, she wouldn't buy any more. I started skipping meals and eating less per meal to stretch the food we had, and at times I couldn't move without being doubled over in pain. 

I was confined to my room almost constantly. I wasn't allowed to go anywhere but school, a couple of nearby restaurants, and back home. I couldn't leave my house if I wanted to hang out with friends (if only I had any) because I had to be in her presence at all times. I hypothesized about going to hang out with a female friend and was told I wouldn't be allowed to without her following behind us (I was 17 when I asked). If I wanted to hang out with a male friend, they had to go through a background check of sorts (it was easier to get a gun card than to get some friends I could hang with). I had to get their parents' phone numbers so she could talk to them, and then she would decide whether or not I could go, which wasn't even a guarantee. Imagine you're in school, and a kid who wants to be friends with you tells you they need your parents to talk to each other and give their permission. That's embarrassing. I would imagine I'd be laughed at and made fun of, or they wouldn't go through all the trouble for someone who was already known as an incredibly strange individual, so most of the time I never tried out of fear of this. 

I had no way to cope surrounded by people, and knowing what some of them might think of me, I would put my head down for weeks in every class because at this point I was genuinely terrified of people. I had developed selective mutism and would not talk to  98 percent of students and about 80 to 90 percent of staff; when I did, it was in short, vague sentences and almost only when spoken to. Up until I was 15, the abuse continued the same as before, but as I got older, it became more Physical I had mostly stopped getting hit with belts, and when I did get hit, it was in the arm and chest, with the occasional hit in the mouth. I'd be backed into a corner while my mother yelled the most vile and hurtful things at me. I was told I ruined her life and that I kept her from having a life. If I ever lost my keys, I would immediately be in trouble, but if I lied about it, that was even worse. My mom worked from home before it was cool to work from home, so she was almost constantly home. If I had lied about having my keys, I would have been locked out of the house for hours until she finished working, rain or shine; snowing and cold; hot and humid; it didn't matter. But that mostly stopped when the damage it did to me became apparent, and I had a psychotic episode. 

My mother was upset with me for some reason and was yelling loudly about how worthless I was, that she wished I was never born, and so on. (At this point, I was the most miserable I'd been in a long time. My mental state was comparable to the fragility of a ceramic plate: solid, sturdy, and functional. Just pray to God you don't drop it if you'd like it to remain intact.) I became late because I had misplaced my hat, but when I told her I had it in my pocket, she said, ""Let me see it then; why is it not on your head? Put it on!"" So I began looking for my hat in my bookbag, and when I found it, she snatched it from my grasp and smacked me on the head with it. I felt something click inside me, like a light switch being turned on. Without warning, I began having a psychotic breakdown. I put my hands on my head and started screaming as loud as I could uncontrollably, ""I can't take it! I can't take it anymore,"" repeatedly while frantically shuffling like a chicken with its head cut off in front of my mom. I had no control over my actions, and my mother stopped me and pulled my hands off my head, but I wouldn't stop screaming, and she had to calm me down in order for me to stop. It was terrifying for the both of us because I think it was the first time she had ever seen anything like that, and it was the first time I ever did anything like that. The feeling was terrifying almost indescribable the closest comparison I could make is to the tea cup scene from get out. I felt like I got yanked out my body while simultaneously remaining in there like my soul was trapped behind my eyes and all I could do is watch. 

After that experience, my mother began to soften her stance toward me, and the big 19 began, so I had virtual classes for about two years that I never finished, but I persevered and eventually graduated (while failing a significant number of classes), and when I did, I was enrolled in an alternative school. When I was eighteen, me and my mom got into an argument because I didn't want to go back to school. It was boring and sad because there were only two or three kids in my class, and we did elementary school work all day. There were no phones, we had to wear uniforms, and free time was scarce. The only slightly good part was that we worked a couple hours a day and they paid us. But it was only four dollars an hour, and we worked two hours each day unless you were in the special work program, which meant you worked two extra hours after school. With the long cab ride there, I'd get home around 5:30 to 6:00 every day, only to wake up at 8 a.m. and do it all over again. But we agreed that if I found a job before school resumed, I wouldn't have to go. I had a week and a half to do it. 

I applied everywhere and even made it all the way through orientation at one place, but I was in a factory doing 12 hour shifts and about 4 miles from my house, so I turned it down because I was scared and had to be realistic because walking multiple miles through areas I'd never been to daily was just too much for me. I was told I had to leave if I wasn't working or going to school, and I couldn't stay the night. I was kicked out after calling my grandparents, who said I could stay with them. I packed two weeks worth of clothes and walked over there. The first few weeks were weird, but I finally saw the light at the end of the world's darkest and longest tunnel. For the first time in years, I knew what it was like to not be abused and verbally assaulted on a daily basis. But, unfortunately, I was beyond repair, at least on my own. I searched for a job and tried to enroll in college, but I was never taught or allowed to do that growing up. I was raised indoors and was never taught the skills needed to survive outside. I still didn't know how to talk to people, and I was terrified of them. I would have panic attacks a couple times a month and rely on others to feed and clothe me. I was wearing the same two weeks worth of clothes for several months until my great-grandmother sent me more. 

Around this time I started smoking weed, and it was amazing how those first times getting high were the best and made me forget all about my problems and truly relax. But I didn't know what I was getting into and developed an exponentially growing habit. I started taking fake Xanax and getting slumped while I went about my day high as a kite. Just to forget about the majority of what I did the following day. The only reason my Xan problem didn't get out of hand was that I kept losing all of the pills after a few times, so I stopped buying them. But it was too late when I exhausted the small amount I had and began withdrawing. Let me tell you, like anyone else who has dealt with Xan withdrawals will tell you, they are not to be played with; hell isn't even a good enough comparison. It's something I truly wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. (My mom excluded.) I had severe paranoia, extreme agitation, a splitting headache that wouldn't quit, and panic attacks frequently (plus a strong urge to KMS as well, which is normal at this point). But I was lucky: Xanax is the only drug that can kill you by going cold turkey, and if your body became physically dependent, you were more than likely to have multiple seizures coming your way. 

My replacement for Xanax was fake Mallinckrodt pills, aka dirty 30s, blues, perc 30s, or whatever name you used or knew they were synonymous with fentanyl or worse. (Believe me when I say they most definitely make things worse than fent) I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I got worse because they didn't test positive for fent, which means its something the test couldn't detect. I turned full junkie and was smoking them off foil before I was 19. I overdosed twice going to sleep, and I was never confident if I was going to wake up. The opioid withdrawals are 100x easier than the Xans, and I was smoking drugs stronger than fentanyl. I quit those, and not too long after, I was taking fake ecstasy pills and Molly capsules, which, aside from the slight stimulant psychosis and vomiting, were probably my favorites. They let me experience happiness for the first time and gave me the ability to communicate and interact with other people. It felt like I'd been missing something my entire life. 

Now I'm 19 on the cusp of being a broke ""adult"" with no real skills, aspirations, or anything positive going for him. This year I discovered while in high school I was diagnosed with autism, ADHD, ODD, social anxiety disorder, and antisocial personality disorder, all while attending school, and nobody ever told me or hinted at it to me in the slightest at all. I guess they just wanted me to cruise through life ignorant and struggling. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] reminded of how much of a burden I am [REDACTED_NAME] I can't do much more than take care of myself. I hide it somewhat well due to my lifelong fear of being mistaken for insane, but it takes an enormous amount of effort to even get out of bed and make something to eat. In order to keep the invasive thoughts and feelings away, I have to keep myself entertained and amused all day or else the feelings come rushing back. I honestly hate my life. I have little to look forward to and regret my almost entire life due to me ruining any chance at fun I had growing up because of how I behaved. I can barely leave my house, and if I go anywhere beyond a couple of blocks, I have panic attacks and get extreme anxiety that effects me physically. I feel my ability to comprehend and understand things slowing down. It's harder to focus and pay attention, and I feel almost like an alien when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] other people. 

Recently, I had a phone call with my mom and had a panic attack (we haven't spoken in 2 years since I was put out). It was just like old times, when she was mad at me about a misunderstanding and was yelling and screaming about how I don't care that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] her money. (she bought my phone as a gift on a payment plan when I turned 18) As an adult I felt extremely disrespected by the things she said so before my mental health suffered anymore I hung up mid sentence and blocked her. The next day my phone was bricked and completely unusable, as it was technically not paid for, so somebody had to get me a new phone. Today I feel extremely hopeless towards any chance of repairing my life. I don't know what to do and I wish I did. I wish I could shake this dead man walking feeling I've got. Throughout the day, life doesn't even feel real at times. I feel as though if I keep hanging in there, eventually someone's going to find me hanging from somewhere. I don't know how my relatives do it. I could never imagine being their age. This isn't everything that's ever happened to me (I know it's hard to believe), but I feel I've described my story as concisely as possible in a semi-chronological order. Anything else would just be extra or I'd be repeating myself. With all that being said, my think noodle is hurting, and I think (clearly I do too much of this) I need to find it some dopamine. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this fully because, as God knows, I can't tell a living soul who knows me this. Night. -NT",2
125smc9,1680106326.0,2023-03-29 16:12:06,offmychest,Lost Girl,"Today 2023 I am 4 years into my recovery. I spent a lot of time covering and burying these feelings of neglect, hurt, loneliness, and hate for myself. I was addicted to crack/cocaine, I did cocaine before crack and almost hated it, it gave me the worst sinus infection and I eventually switched to meth. I was that kind of addict that could have died from the lifestyle alone. I traded my morals, self respect and care for anything I ever loved for one more hit. I failed rehab 3 times and did a little time in county. I was the only girl in county jail with the charge ""prostitution."" I look back now and I realize that the rehab time and all that bull shit was not for me to get better, if we are being honest if I recall one of the only reasons I went was to get out of the cold or because I had nowhere else to go. I wanted to get better but I knew deep down that I wasn't done with drugs, I admit everytime I walked into those doors of treatment my heart was not 100% on stopping drugs. I did try a few times to figure out why I turned to drugs and what was my deep core issue that I was covering up. This story explains finally why I am [REDACTED_NAME] way I am. Why I slept with over 20 guys by the time I was 15, including a married man. Now you can say what you want about me but I believe I was looking for love and affection. My innocence was taken from me at a very very young age and the influence I grew up around was not ideal for a kid. My mom and dad were young when they had me and now I know they got married because mom got pregnant, I think she was 19. My dad drank ALOT and he could get mentally, emotionally and physically abusive, if he got enough in him or drank whiskey.  Dad has a big heart and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only daughter, he is kind, generous, and a good dad. 

I took a lot of time in rehab to try to uncover my issues and try to heal but I got scared and ran every time. This time was different. In 2019 I was left by a guy I depended on, we were both homeless and my stuff was in his truck. One night he decided he wasn't gonna pick me up after work and it left me no choice but to do whatever I could to survive these streets. I needed to put my ducks in a row. By the time I realized he wasn't coming it was 10pm, I needed to find a bed, food, shower maybe, and more drugs to barter with. I ran the streets for almost 2 weeks alone with no help or someone to lean on. When I met Mel, I was looking rough, I had bruises all up and down my arms and legs, I was 90lbs, I haven't eaten in a day or two, and the best part I had the clothes on my back and maybe one more outfit in my bag. I had no underwear, one bra, like no socks, it was truly ridiculous. I lost everything I ever loved and owned 2ce over. I was Finally tired, finally just done. 

I met Mel in April of 2019, he was appalled when he realized how much I had lost and I still don't know what his true intentions were, maybe it was to help me or maybe it was to get in my pants, whatever it was I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it happened. I got clean with Mels love and support, no rehab, no NA or AA, I was done and I knew I had to stop or I was gonna die. 

These past 4 years I left state with Mel, we traveled for a bit and in this time I got to really think about what happened to me and why. It took some time for me to trust Mel and not think he was gonna leave in another state or somewhere stranded, he never did. I had nightmares, flashbacks, and bursts of anger for the first year. I really had to push through but I decided to write this story to maybe help someone that went through something similar. 

I was in a relationship with a 31 yr old when I was 12-13 years old.

A little back story: When I was growing up my dad was a carefree kind and just a free spirit. He was a functional alcoholic, he would get off work and drink anywhere from a half gallon to a whole gallon of vodka a night and get up at 6am and go to work. My mom and dad got divorced when I was young so I was passed back and forth but my dads was my favorite. I was allowed to do whatever I wanted and as a teenager I took advantage of that. Dad had a lot of friends and they drank too. Dad was close to his brother and he had a few real close friends who were around everyday of my childhood for as long as I can remember. The one in particular I will never forget. I was young, I mean like maybe 7-8 when (let's call him Jim) I met Jim. He was young, good looking and had been friends with dad from work. Jim and another one of dads friends lived together so they all started hanging out at my house. I had a friend over and she was a little older that day when Jim first came to my house. She was curious about him and I don't remember much about that day but I do recall Jim laying his head on her lap while she played with his hair. She gave him those flirty eyes and they sat there and talked. Remind you even though Jim was in his late 20s and my friend was maybe 12-13 at the time. Not long after I met Jim he got into some trouble and was sent to prison for a few years.

Fast Forward>>>>>

I was 11 when I found a letter from Jim to my dad. I wasn't sure if I was even allowed to read it but I opened it up and read it anyway. I will never forget the letters that formed the word ""tell wild child I said hi."" I don't know why I got curious, I actually don't even know what I was thinking. I spent days thinking of the letter, I guess I was lonely, I had to have felt some type of emptiness to write him back. I was 11 writing a grown ass man in prison for pulling out a gun on some guys who robbed him. Me and Jim talked about everything, he became my best friend really quick. I don't know why but I felt comfortable talking to him and telling him things that were happening with me, my friends, my boyfriend, and my family. He talked about his wife and 2 boys, he gave advice and was just very sweet, acted like he understood me and was very genuine. I now see as an adult he was manipulating me as a child but that little girl was craving for attention. We got to know each other, we talked all the way up to the day me and my dad and my friend were with us pulled up to the house after school and there Jim was sitting on our porch, just chilling. Thats when things got confusing and fucked up. I hate telling this story. It is so hard for me to realize what he was doing to me the whole time.. 

I don't really wanna get into the specifics. Um.. we Got close when he got out, He touched me multiple times, and also touched my friends. He gave me a ring at one point, Jim was 31 years old and I was 13 years old. It wasn't right and I hate that it went on as long as it did. He would kiss me when my dad wasn't around and tell me he loved me. Until the night it all ended. My friend came over while Jim was there I had a boyfriend over and supposedly Jim raped her when I wasnt in the room. There were hickeys on her neck and she was partying and drinking like a rockstar when I left her. I still have no idea what happened that night we even remained friends for a long time after and she never talked about it. I confessed to her that he was doing the same shit to me as he had been touching me for almost a year. She eventually did go to the police that night and she told them about me and everything that was happening. The police charged Jim with 2 counts of sexual imposition with a minor and 1 count rape he got 6 years. I always felt so guilty for sending him to prison, I hated that I had to tell I was ashamed of what he did to me but I was a child. When Jim had 6 months left in his sentence he killed himself in prison. I still don't know if that is true, how he died but I have had to go through years of trying to accept this in my past and live life to the fullest everyday without the reminder of what Jim did to me. I still can't tell you how it affected me, I guess it did in all kinds of ways and me wanting the attention in the first place makes me wonder. Growing up with my father letting me do whatever I wanted mainly because he only had my part time and I didnt think he ever wanted to be ""the bad guy"". He was more of a friend to me and when he drank too much it could turn bad quick. All of it is in the past and I have tried my whole life to forgive myself for my part in his death. I wanted to tell some of my story. it goes farther than this but i needed to get it out into the world.

I want to make this clear, my dad was an addict/alcoholic. He did the best he could with what he was given, even though he was asleep during this event and many others, he was clueless but now looking back as a recovering addict that it wasn't my dads fault. We trusted this man, he was a close family friend for many many years. We never thought that he would target 3 teenage girls. I thought the man really cared about me and I believed what he told me. 

Years later I changed schools my sophomore year and was in a small class with 2 girls and this geeky guy. (This was the year I found out Jim died) One of the girls, lets call her Ashley was telling our science teacher how her nephews dad was in prison and had just died, he was in the for 6 years for rape. She said that the girl lied and it was sad that her nephew had to lose his dad, she said that her Aunt Jims kids mom was distraught and in shock he could ever do the things he was accused of. I knew she was talking about me, I kept it to myself. What happened happened, I can't change a thing. 

This is me moving on and not being afraid to face any fear because I faced my biggest one. I will never stop healing but I can finally move on and let go. So Goodbye Jim.",6
1hsv649,1735933575.0,2025-01-03 19:46:15,offmychest,"I’m 22, and I’ve Realized I Won’t Make It Past 40 with Kids","I 22 f am home for winter break. Most of my breaks are spent working as a surgical assistant; I’ve been in healthcare every summer and winter break since I started college. I’m majoring in neurobiology and astrophysics. This winter break, the surgeon I assist was out of the country, so I needed another way to make a little extra cash before heading back to school.

On a whim, I posted on Facebook offering babysitting services. The responses were overwhelming. Families flooded my inbox, many of them alumni from my Ivy League university who love to support current students. Some were even in careers I’m aspiring to, medicine and science, so babysitting offered a chance to not only earn but also to network. I’ve always known I wanted kids. Even though my childhood was far from perfect, I’ve felt drawn to the idea of being a parent. I thought I understood the grit it takes to raise children, and I believed I was up for the challenge. That belief lasted until this winter break.

Babysitting these families wasn’t horrible. The kids were just kids, full of life and energy, and I think they enjoyed having me around. But for the first time, I saw the unfiltered reality behind the curtain. The sheer energy, patience, and emotional bandwidth required to create a safe, nurturing environment for these little lives shook me to my core. It was nothing short of magic, but magic that came at an unimaginable cost.

My first babysitting gig was for a mother who graduated from my university and was also a doctor. Despite her impressive credentials, she had stepped away from her career to care for her two kids: a baby under one year old and a four-year-old. Her husband was a scientist too. When I arrived, she admitted she’d hired me just so she could take a nap. She looked utterly exhausted, running on fumes and a diet she wasn’t proud of. She spoke fondly about her time in medicine, but every question about her future in the field ended in the same sad truth that she couldn’t go back. The degree she worked 12 years for now sat idle.

That first hour, I watched her soothe her kids, negotiate with them to avoid tantrums, and finally rush out the door to run errands that couldn’t wait. It was an ordeal, a logistical ballet, and it shocked me. She wasn’t broken, but she was tired. So tired. Her kids even liked me quite a bit. When she left, I entertained her kids, but the moment I got back to my car, **I sat there and cried.**

This wasn’t a bad day for her. It was normal. Her children weren’t unusually difficult, and her situation wasn’t dire. But the reality of her life, a highly educated woman, living in a nice area, married to a partner with a good job, left no room for her own aspirations, health, or even sleep. That realization gutted me.

As the days passed and I babysat for other families, the pattern repeated. Parents sacrificing their entire lives, pouring every ounce of energy, money, and sanity into their children. And despite their impressive accomplishments, they struggled. Even in the best of circumstances, financial stability, supportive partners, good jobs, they were tethered to a life that seemed suffocating. It ALSO hit me: unless I make an objectively enormous salary and share that financial burden with someone equally stable, having children would mean living in a constant state of struggle. And if I somehow made it work, I knew I’d regret it.

I grew up very financially privileged, but I realized even that wouldn’t be enough. The environment, resources, and emotional health required to raise children are luxuries only full time parenting can truly afford. And even then, the cost is so high, mentally, emotionally, physically.

For the first time in my life, I started rethinking my future. I realized something that felt like both a revelation and a heartbreak: I don’t want children. I’ve always imagined myself with a family, balancing motherhood and a thriving medical career. But after this winter break, that vision feels like a lie I was sold, a promise that isn’t realistic for me. Instead of dreaming about imaginary kids, I started thinking about something else; the life I have right now. I love my work, my studies, and my relationship. I work long hours in the summer so I can travel with my partner, and those experiences bring me a joy I’ve never known. The thought of continuing this, of building a life filled with passion, love, and freedom, feels extremely exciting. And it’s a life I know I can sustain.

I don’t say this lightly. I cried over this realization for days, trying to make sense of it. But the more I thought about it, the clearer it became. The life I’ve been building, the dreams I’ve chased, the person I’ve become, WILL disappear under the weight of parenthood. Motherhood is beautiful, no doubt. But the sacrifice it demands? It’s not for me. I’ve learned more about myself in these few weeks than I have in years, and I’m finally at peace with the idea that I don’t need children to live a fulfilled life. For the first time, I feel excited about my future, not the one I thought I wanted, but the one I'm [REDACTED_NAME] right now and will continue living. - Idk why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this post, ig to vent??

He had spent his paycheck before, and didn’t get paid untill the next day, so here I was paying for his drinks. His friend noticed, and bought me a shot. Some of my boyfriends old friends showed up, and he just disappeared for 30 minutes. His friends made sure to chat with me the whole time, and make me feel less alone. They would all go out to smoke, and have me watch his table, but his two friends were the only ones asking me if it was okay, and in a genuine way, not a “I’m asking to be nice but I’m gonna be upset if you make me stay” way  like he was. He did try to act like a good bf saying “if any men act up when I’m gone lmk and I’ll handle it”, but there wouldn’t be anything to handle if he stayed. I had also told my boyfriend I worked at 6 Am the next day, so I didn’t want to stay too late. It came to 12:30. An hour after he said we’d leave, and all the sudden his old friends want to go to a different a bar until close. My bf automatically agreed without asking me. I privately pulled him aside, and told him I wanted to go home, and this night was supposed to be about us, and he said “it’s okay you can get an Uber” i practically begged him to come with me, but he was adamant, about staying out. it was 1am, my phone was dead, i was drunk, i was shocked he wanted me to just get an Uber and go home alone. I had to pull him aside and lay it on him for him to understand he’s being an absolute DICK, and he needs to get me home. He was rolling his visibly annoyed because “I never see these people I just wanna go with them, this is what happens at bars, you see old friends and hang out with them”. His friends then noticed i was upset, on the verge of tears, and offered to walk me home, and that’s when my bf agreed to walk with us. They got me home, hugged me good bye, before my boyfriend even said goodbye, and watched me walk in. I always knew my bf wasn’t the best, but this night taught me he’s actually the worst. I hate to say it, but I was fantasizing about dating his friends instead of him.",3307
11mjvh0,1678339863.0,2023-03-09 05:31:03,offmychest,Didn’t realize so many men were so sexist,"I’m tired. I’m tired of being a woman and men telling me that I have it good or better than them. I’m tired of having to be scared of men, not being able to walk alone in the dark without fear of being followed. The fact is, that women are more likely to have violent crimes made against them, and most of these crimes will be from men. And crimes against men? Will also mostly be from men. Of course some do come from women. But I’m tired of men not recognizing how women struggle. I’m tired of having to fight for rights to have an abortion, tired of having to be the one to take birth control (if i want to) and the man never needing to deal with the repercussions (side effects of BC), tired of scary things happening to me from men (such as being followed in the night, sexually harassed, catcalled) then when i go tell a man about it they just laugh, i’m tired of having to pay for menstrual products and bleeding 7 days every 3 weeks and bloating and cramping, I’m tired of feeling like my opinion is not as valued as a man’s. Most of all I’m tired that men don’t see their privilege. I’m tired of my struggles not being acknowledged. I just want them to be acknowledged. Stop telling me we have equal rights. I’m so sick of it. You hear about all these horrific crimes men commit yet they still can’t see that they are the problem.

Edit: if you are a man, thinking of commenting on this, maybe talk to another woman about it first. so many of these comments are so hurtful and just proving what I felt. This is an off my chest post, not a prove me wrong post. Please. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of getting shut down.

Second edit: got many horrible messages from men. I’m so exhausted.",1784
q1ulm1,1633433991.0,2021-10-05 11:39:51,offmychest,"The words ""except for daddy... Huh?"" Will haunt me the rest of my life","I grew up in the predominant church in Utah... Yup... That one. One Sunday when I was 13-15 years old I was trying to get my mom out to the car after church (a time honored tradition). She was chatting with her good friend and some other women from the ""Ward""... Whatever it was they were talking about I heard one of them say something to the effect of; ""I don't care who you are you do not have the right to touch a child that way"" all the women nodded and the crowd mumbled in agreement. Off to the left of the crowd a young girl with long braids tugged at her mother's skirt and in a hushed tone said ""except for daddy... Huh?"" She was probably less than 10 at the time... The mother hushed her daughter and returned attention to the neighborhood gossip. I felt weird about that but was sure I took something out of context or misunderstood. Either way I wanted to get home and get out of my uncomfortable clothes and shoes as soon as possible.

Fast-forward several years... I left the church and started smoking pot. I got caught then tried to avoid paying my ""debt to society"" and was subsequently thrown in jail on a 30 day commitment (for paraphernalia... Yeah, I didn't even have any weed... I was put in jail for a dirty pipe). During the intake process, I was being escorted from one part of booking to the next when I see a familiar face... It was the longtime, squeaky clean, ward clerk. I thought that was odd... Surely it was a mistake... Maybe he is there for work (but he was cuffed)... Parking tickets... Something innocent, I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. 

I mention seeing this guy to my mother when I speak with her on the jail phone and she tells me dudes wife got up during fast and testimony meeting and explained that her husband has turned himself in for molesting (raping) his daughter from the time she was very young until she was a teenager. The police were altered when she had revealed the abuse to her bishop during the interview process to be married in the church's temple. I instantly remembered the interaction I witnessed at the church that day. Even now I can remember her look up to her mom for reassurance, that her dad was the exception to the arbitrary thing this neighbor was talking about.

I was the only person who had that perspective on the conversation in the church foyer that day. Her mother and I were potentially the only ones who could have helped her. I don't blame myself because I was young and I wasn't trained to look for stuff like that; but I would hope if I ever hear something like that again I would act. 

Later I learned from my younger brother that her younger brother (they were friends) had to walk the long way home from school... I wonder why... There were signs. She basically told me her dad was abusing her. Her mother obviously knew about the abuse. No one helped her. She endured for years after that. It breaks my heart. I wish I would have told someone what I heard. 

If you know someone is being abused, please help them. Don't stay silent. I could have potentially prevented years of sexual abuse but I didn't take it serious. It has stuck with me so on some level I knew it was serious but I was too self absorbed to help.

I realize this isn't really my story to tell and if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of line for sharing I will remove this post.",65
yb3oua,1666486312.0,2022-10-23 00:51:52,offmychest,We broke up 2 years ago & now we're (kind of) together again. I couldn't be happier.,"Hi, I normally don't use reddit besides for the anime and spicy stuff however I don't really know who to gush to so here I am. 

So I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my story here and a gush as a pt 2.

**Warning this is super long**

I, (F19) and him (M19) are a few months apart in age, him being a little older. We met sometime in June and got together in July of 2019 and broke up October of 2020.
Anyway this is my point of view from 2019-present day. 
It will make sense when it is coming to an end and everything will be explained. Also I'm [REDACTED_NAME] summing it up. 


It's almost like a movie, we were ldr though. Everything was perfect, we made each other better, we made each other happy. Everything was perfect besides the fact we spent every moment together and neglected our friendships (This is important info). I even bought him a necklace, which to be honest was kind of expensive. The necklace was a star with a rose on top of it, it was also silver. I was poetic at the time so I had bought it with that. That's basically how our relationship was, everyday we would laugh and spend time pouring effort into one another. Until one day in January he starts texting me less and less and eventually starts ignoring me. Of course, I was worried, I was scared I was losing him. I had never ever felt this way before and I felt so much for him. I wanted to marry him (again we were like 17 so I was still airheaded), I wanted to make things better and who better to turn to than his best friend?
 Let's call this best friend Jay. So I met Jay through my boyfriend at the time (Jay was 20/21 at the time) , he was really fun and we hung out sometimes. When I began to get worried I went to Jay and I asked him to help me, literally begging him to, crying. I just wanted to fix it. This went on for months. Even though he ignored me he still tried to communicate that he loved me. He never once cheated and he never once looked for other people nor did I. I didn't know what I had done wrong so I'd ask Jay constantly so make sure if my boyfriend was okay, if he was eating, ect. On top of that I'd ask if he said anything about me.
So Jay would tell me bits and pieces of all the negative information. I never once got made until 4 months in when I was told he was calling me a dramatic bish. To be honest my anger was fueled slowly by the people around me, all of them telling me to leave that I deserved better and that he didn't love me. They all made pretty solid points. However he never once tried to hurt me, he looked out for me and defended me on multiple occasions. He made sure I was okay on the sidelines. I didn't know until later on and he never once has admitted it to me, I just noticed after looking back.
Anyway I'm [REDACTED_NAME] getting more and more beaten down and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] hope. As this is going on Jay is telling how much a price of crap he his and how I should be treated better. During this time Jay was the only one I trusted because he was supposed to be helping me make things better. When he started saying those harsh things I slowly believed him. I was scared, lonely, deprived, and overall- I missed him. I missed my boyfriend, I missed his smile, his laugh, I missed him. 
A few more months pass and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] thin ice, I don't feel good, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] numb. One night in October Jay asks me why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this to myself. Why am I hurting myself by staying with him. Simple questions, but it just pushed me over the edge. I didn't know what else to do, I was tired. I was so very tired. I still loved him, in fact my heart ached for him. So I broke up with him over text in the middle of the night while I was talking to Jay. So I have Jay on the phone and Jay's telling me to be ruthless to be honest, to just let him have it. So I do. The guilt of what I wrote still sticks with me. I mean I painted this really negative light on him and I think I broke him a little. I'd like to add that I wrote a part I didn't exactly tell Jay in that moment but I started it off which how I felt. How I really felt. That I loved him, he was my everything, and I didn't know what else to do but I couldn't hurt myself. 
Jay is still his best friend though, a bit odd considering he's telling me to write things like ""It's your fault we were over and all I did was give you my heart."" Which is probably the nicest thing that was said when Jay was telling me to let him have it. 
I'll be honest, when I was going to break up with him I had- probably the last bit of hope in me- that he would stop me and tell me that he could do better. 
He didn't. He let me go, he told me to be happy, he told me he wanted to be in my life, he told me to basically be happy to live. 

I was broken.
It tore me in two. 
So I'm [REDACTED_NAME], borderline scream-crying. It felt like my throat was being crushed and I felt so powerless. It wasn't normal, I wasn't tense like most people get, I wasn't bawled up, my hands weren't in fists. I was weak I was laid out on my bed, my throat wasn't tense yet it felt crushed, my body couldn't move, my head was light and all I could do was cry. My hands couldn't even hold my phone. 
It messed me up.
Jay's listening and telling me it'll all be better and guess what. He loves me, he has loved me since the day he met me. He said he would treat me better. I didn't reply really but remember yearning for what he was telling me. Just wanting someone who loved me and would fight for me. I just cried that night. 
I cried the next day, 
I cried the next week, I cried for months. 
So Jay (21ish) asks me out the day after we broke up, then proceeds to take it back wanting to wait till I was 18. 
I didn't reply, I just wanted the company. Everyone else was rather pissed that I was so sad. Told me to get over it, it didn't matter, ect. 
Jay never really said anything besides that he cared about me. So a week passes and Jay says fuck it and asks me out again, we don't do anything, I was in pain still, too much. 
finally it's 2 weeks after the break up, Jay is telling me my now ex is so happy and that he moved on with no problem. It stung. It stung so bad.

So finally I told Jay that he knew how I felt about my ex and he said he knew and didn't care, that he would help me. So i just accepted Jay's advances. 
Then Jay tells my ex and they get upset. 
We argue for a while, Jay starts acting like he's a victim and did nothing wrong. 
It kinda puts a damper on their friendship and kills me mentally because I knew it destroyed every chance I could have had. 

Jay gave me everything. Communication, gifts, time, everything I wanted. 
I felt empty. I know that's bad of me. I felt empty, I convinced myself to love him. He convinced me to, too. 
I never once lied though, I never once said that he was more than my ex. As soon as I had realized I had convinced myself to love him, 
I told him. However he did not care, he begged me to stay and to fall in love with him. 
I couldn't. I could never fall in love with anyone. 
No matter how many times I tried to leave Jay, he wouldn't let me, he guilt tripped me. He was manipulative. He convinced me to be sexual towards him and I did so. I began doing it while being unprovoked because in my mind I thought I should be. We were 17 and 21.
In this case, it's bad. 
I tried leaving but never could and finally he agreed to a break/time out and I never did that with the intention of seeing other people. I did end up flirting with a few people though. However when he found out, I guess that it wasn't okay anymore, though it was discussed and we agreed that it was a break to just be free for a while on both sides. He finally let me go. 
I finally left him for good.

And yes, I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] good, 
I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for what I did even under those circumstances. I know I messed up, I have no excuse for what I did. 

As hard and mean, probably dispicable as it is.

The truth is he would have never been enough. No one could ever be. He may of did things right but underneath the surface he never did it with the intention of just doing it. He always wanted something. Even when he ""helped me.""

So that's the story of how the first time went.
Now heres the things I didn't know: 

- My boyfriend needed a break from the clinginess of our relationship but didn't want to hurt my feelings ( and I assume when I became upset and started getting irrated I wasn't exactly the most disireable) 

- Jay would harrass my boyfriend about me literally in paragraphs calling him all sorts of things. Then when my boyfriend finally responded he only told me the negatives. 

- Jay lied about how my boyfriend was feeling

- Jay never said why my boyfriend said negative things, just that he did

- Jay never told me the positives 

- Jay made it seem so much worse than what it was. 


I often times regret what I did
I texted him, apologizing. I knew I didn't have a chance with him but I just wanted to know him again. To be close with him again- friends. However when I convinced myself to let go, I'd go ghost.
 (This happened off and on) 

I never told him how I felt. I sometimes flirted but they weren't really flirts, just compliments.
This last time when I texted him. 
He told me how he felt. 
We both felt the same.
All these years.

The flutter is the same,
I never stopped loving him.
I never lost feelings for my boyfriend. He made me into someone that I've grown to love, he made me happy, and he was my best friend. 
I love him. 
I will always, always, choose him.


Today he said he loved me and I could barely reply. 

Take this as being childish, that's fine.
I think he is the only person that will ever light this fire in me. 
I don't want to say he's the one, because I don't know. 
I do know he makes me feel alive.",2
10jodv5,1674510107.0,2023-01-23 21:41:47,offmychest,"I stood up to my narcissistic maternal grandfather, but my own parents, and grandmother didn't stand by my side and ousted me as the bad guy","Hello, This is quite a long story, and I want to be as detailed as possible so that everybody can understand where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] from. I'm a 23-year-old man and a current community college student, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for a part-time job as well. Growing up I only had my maternal grandfather in my life. My paternal grandfather walked out on my Dad and his mother when my father was very young, so I never knew him or even met him. Over the years as I've gotten older, I realized the kind of person my maternal grandfather is.

 My maternal grandfather Pete is 78 years old. He's an immigrant from Hungary that grew up poor with a single mother and younger sister. His father died in combat in WW2 before he was born.  He grew up in communist Hungary during the 1950s, and I believe these are the reasons that shaped his personality. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that my grandpa Pete has NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder) because he clearly shows many of the traits that a person with NPD possesses. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a therapist, however, I am a very observant person. Pete lacks empathy he is arrogant about his ""intelligence"" he is manipulative, and if you don't agree with what he says you're wrong, and he's right. He constantly brags to me, and the other relatives, even in front of my grandmother at the dinner table about how he cheated on my grandmother multiple times with women, from various countries he's traveled to.  I quote him ""When I was at the brothel in Paris that was the best time of my life.""  My grandmother ignores him or just goes along with whatever Pete says. It makes my blood boil and it makes me heartbroken because my grandmother gave Pete multiple chances, she forgave him every single fucking time!  I know in my heart my grandmother deserves better!

Yesterday was when all hell broke loose. I went with my parents to visit my maternal grandparents. The night started normally, we would have dinner and then me, my Dad, and Pete would watch a movie while my Mom and grandmother would talk in the kitchen. My grandfather makes obnoxious comments during a movie so watching a movie with him isn't exactly the most enjoyable experience. This is the main part of the story. 

 **Trigger Warning:** There was a r\*pe scene during the movie ""Hold the Dark"" and my grandfather made a sarcastic joke. I grabbed the TV remote to pause the movie, I turned to him and scolded him for making a ""joke"" about said scene. I said ""You don't ever joke about r\*pe! How would you feel if that was your mother, sister, etc? I shit you not he says to me and says My mother is dead with a smile on his face. I ignore his snarky remark. I continue and I say to Pete that's one of the worst things you can joke about! Of course, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only one in my corner with no backup, no surprise there. My idiot father to the left of me is sitting on the couch on his phone, mindlessly scrolling like a bot during the movie, and in the middle of a heated argument between his son and his father-in-law! I turn to my Dad and ask him ""You didn't hear what he just said?!"" He's confused and doesn't understand what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about. 

 I said it loud enough for my father to hear me. Also, my grandfather talks loudly because he is deaf in one ear so it wasn't the level of volume projected that was an issue. I tell my Dad about the situation and he just looks at me like I have three heads and then he looks back at Pete. My dad says ""Oh he was just being sarcastic."" Pete chimes in and says ""That's what happens during the war"", my father agreed with him. As if I didn't already know r\*pe was part of countless wars that are fought. I ignore his third idiotic comment.  My mom comes from the kitchen to announce that the tea is ready to drink. I tell both of them the tea is ready and I pause the movie. We all walk to the dining room. 

Everybody is now in the dining room and seated in their chairs. I turn to my grandfather and said to him don't fucking make jokes about that ever again as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] up with his bullshit! The energy in the room changes immediately. My grandmother has this nervous look on her face and she looks to the corner of the room, and my mom starts getting anxious and yells at me. Pete tells me to shut the fuck up, I stand up, walk to his chair and tell him to make me shut the fuck up. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if anybody else heard what Pete said except me. My idiot father jumps out of his chair as if it was on fire, he yells at me by my name, and he then yells at me to back down from the top of his lungs. For some reason he decided now would be a great time to address the situation. 

Yelling at somebody yelling isn't going to resolve jack shit! Now that my Dad is yelling in my face. He points his finger at my face like when a parent scolds their young kid. I can't remember everything he said because of all the commotion. I slapped his fingers that were pointing at my face away from me, and my Mom got in between us to separate us. 

All the attention that I directed at Pete was now focused on me and my Dad. My Dad didn't stop yelling, and he was in my face so I yelled back in his face, and I told him to back off and to shut the fuck up, he didn't so I pushed him, and he pushed me back. Now everybody was standing up because shit was going down. My grandmother finally had a genuine reaction for once and was telling me to calm down too. Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] fucking bad guy? That makes absolutely no sense. 

Eventually, we both separated, however, my Dad and I are still yelling at each other. My mom grabs and holds onto my arms, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to myself what does she think she'll accomplish? My dad yells at me to leave the house. I walk close to the entrance, and my grandmother comes up to me and tells me that we shouldn't fight and that we're family. 

I tell my grandmother that's not an excuse for joking about r\*pe and his other actions.  Pete walked closer to ask me why am I acting out.  I told him it was because of what he said. He's clueless and selfish about other people's emotions, except his own. My Mom gets in front of him gently and tells him to not bother. I love how she doesn't grab Pete's arms and gets in his face because he was the one antagonizing and instigating the whole situation. I told Pete I hate him and that I wish we weren't family. He says it's fine if you hate me, and those were the last words we exchanged with one another. 

I open the door and I leave the house. My dad eventually leaves too and we drive home without my Mom. I've realized that I felt so lost throughout my entire life. I feel like every male relative role model I've had is either useless, stupid, too soft to stand up to our narcissistic relatives, or unsupportive except for my cousin Antonio. I don't have any siblings either, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] here to make this a sob story, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to tell y'all my story. 

My mom has constantly guilt-tripped me into me visiting my grandparents without her even realizing it.  This is probably one of the effects my narcissistic grandpa has had on her without her even releasing it. I don't know how to take the right approach towards telling my Mom that I don't want to visit my grandparents every time she wants to visit them. She calls and visits them constantly.  I can't deal with the toxicity and negativity from Pete, life is too short for that shit! I hate the fact that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to him, I wish I wasn't!  My parents always have to compare my life to other people's and that's unfair to those other people and myself. Subconsciously they must think I must have had an easy life, I dare say I haven't had an easy life.

If you've read this far. I honestly can't thank you, guys, enough. I need genuine advice to deal with this situation. I'll try to reply to as many people as possible.  I have so many questions that I want to understand.  Why is my grandfather so fucked up? What made him narcissistic?  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] bad guy in this situation or not. I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] perfect, and I'm a flawed human that is working on becoming the best version of himself. I just pray that the second half of my life will be much more positive than the first half! Also, I am [REDACTED_NAME] in the process of getting back into therapy. I just have to find the right therapist. Cheers 

TLDR: I stood up to my narcissistic grandfather, but nobody in my family backed me up, and I was ousted as the bad guy",1
105dtex,1673060083.0,2023-01-07 02:54:43,offmychest,I don't know myself (I'm sorry. ik this is a massive post.),"TW: bullying, abuse, sh, suicidal thoughts, depression

I have been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember. I first noticed it when I was in grade 7 (7 years ago now, but the symptoms stretched well before then) as I was learning more about mental illnesses to try and help support my abuser. This person is the root of the majority of my trauma as a child, and well into my preteens, before I moved across the country and could cut her out of my life without her trying to kill herself in front of me. she started by bullying me when we were three, then she sexually assaulted me from when I was in grade 2 until we were in grade 7. I know this also means that she was also sexually abused, but I can not bring myself to forgive her for this. she hit me, punched me, isolated me, kicked me, basically did everything imaginable for those first couple years.

But it got better, or so i thought, when one day in grade 5 it just stopped. she had decided she liked me now. So i did what any naïve 5th grader would do, become her friend. I was good for the next couple years as i tended to her every need, learning to walk on eggshells so she wouldn't go back to hurting me, physically at least. going into grade 7, I was happy with how our friendship had developed. she stopped treating me like shit and stopped spreading lies and rumors about me. I wish i could go back in time and beg my parents to let me switch schools. I wish I could go back to when I first told them about her (i was 4) and made them listen. make them understand with the words I have now, not the words that i lacked as a child.

anyway, the good times didn't last, as they tend to, and she started threatening to kill herself. We were 11. about every other week so would text me, telling me how depressed she was and how she didn't want to be here anymore. I didn't fully understand her then, but i can now see why she didn't want to be alive anymore. she's still alive today, so she didn't do it and it become tiresome. it devolved from me crying to my mother that she was going to kill herself to walking up to her room and her response was ""again?"". it sounds cruel, but when these threats came so often, the majority of them were for attention. I was trying to save my best friend and favorite person (yes, like BPD favorite person) from killing themselves at age 11. not to mention all the pictures i got of her fresh cuts. or the ways she would describe, in graphic detail, how she was going to kill herself that weekend.

This year was also the year that I started to find different ways to escape. I grew up very sheltered and my school was very small, so i didn't turn to substances (even tho I know I would have if given the chance). Instead, I escaped into my head. I have always had an overactive imagination, but this was a while new level. I did not know what was real or not. whenever i watched or played something, i would start falling for the characters. i was not able to deal with real life, so i went to living through stories, shows, music, games, celebrities. any and everything i could possibly get my 12 year old hands on to.

This included things like fanfic, which quickly devolved into smut. there is nothing wrong with reading smut, but as a sheltered 12 year old that barley knew what sex was, it was damaging to say the least. I wont go into too much detail with this point, as its not that necessary, but the main point is that how i understood relationships and sex was through the lens of a poorly written smutfic about a fictional character written by someone probably only one or two years my senior. I also have, to this day, never been in a relationship (which I'll talk about more later), but so I would live vicariously through these stories. these characters were the only ones that i felt could love me. I knew that no matter what, i could depend on them because i could imagine them to be dependable. When i was interacting with these medias i was myself, so i felt as though these characters knew me, knew the real me.

school was hostile, home was hostile. my mom and sister were constantly fighting. it didn't matter if we were driving to school, eating supper, getting back from activities. constant yelling. it got so bad that my mom threatened to call the police on my sister. I was trying to escape to my own little world in my headphones, but their screams always seem to shine through in my memories. my sister still treats me poorly to this day. its less yelling and more making me feel like shit. she constantly would talk down to me, make fun of what I like (the few things that actually gave me purpose, as stupid as it sounds), and try to to catch me in lies that i wasn't telling. I spent all my time in my room, but she was convinced that i was sneaking out like she did. Also she tried to out me to my homophobic mother, that didnt work thankfully, or else i wouldn't have a place to live.

I moved in grade 9, after a year and a half of not knowing where i would go. it felt freeing and also trapping at the same time. I was free to be whoever i wanted to. I got a new start. I got away from my abuser. but i was also trapped in my experiences. i was trapped in my past since i started to remember the horrible things that was done to me when i was a little kid. i was finally understanding what happened to me. i was understanding that my parents continuously rejected all of my attempts to tell them. I started self harming. my parents found out. i got sent to therapy. i was getting better. I was dealing with my past and i forgave my abuser. not for her, but for me. i was letting her go. was.

then covid happened. it is no surprise that covid affected me poorly, it affected everybody poorly. i stopped going to therapy. i stayed inside. i barley talked to anybody. but i was content. i've always preferred being by myself. i could unmask and be myself. but i knew it was bad for me, so in started talking to my friends again and it was good. I was still depressed, but it was a bit better. i would get flashback every now and them, but with time those also subsided. school started again and i was in grade 11, the worst for me was that i was kinda out of it the whole time, but that can be said for my entire life. i dissociated my whole life away, so one year isn't that significant in the grand scheme of things. anyway, i slowly started losing all my friends from before i move, except one (im still friends with her and i love her to death), and i started to realize that i didn't have long term friends. i saw all these people around me with childhood friends. people that have known them their entire life. but i didn't. the longest friendship at that time was two years old. everyone else was gone. 

grade 12 was when things went down hill again. it was good for the first semester, but then my friends met someone online and me and him become really close. I was never romantic, from either of us i believe, but he become my favorite person. I did not realize this until after we stopped being friends, but this would lead our friendship to ruin in due time. he was the first person that i ever truly opened up to. i told him about not only my story, but also how it affected me. i remember taking my dog on a walk and sitting on a bench while on vc with him and sobbing because i wanted to die. when i was going through an bad episode, we would vc until i feel asleep. but again, this ended just as quickly as it began. as much as it was good for me at the time, it was bad in the long run as my mental health started to plummet. 

i didn't have many friends in high school. i had horrible social anxiety (like heart pounding, cant think, about to throw up if i talked once in class type). and massive trust and abandonment issues in addition.

 i have always felt like no one really knows me, but that brings up the question, do i know myself? i have masked and mirrored so many people in my life that i don't even know who i am. what i enjoy changes depending on what my friends at the time are doing. if its what i'm [REDACTED_NAME] by myself, then that means, at my core, i am [REDACTED_NAME] depressed and suicidal. i don't even have a laugh. i mirror the laugh of whoever im closest friends with at the time. i am [REDACTED_NAME] my own person. i am [REDACTED_NAME] of everybody that has come in and out of my life. the hardest part about that is that it means my abuser is apart of me. i know that when i say this people automatically try and say ""no. you're nothing like her"" but i know i am. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of her than i would like to admit. i can still seer her mannerisms and speech patterns in my day to day life. habits i picked up while trying to not set her off. she would dump her problems on me then leave. i cant help but feel the same way whenever i talk about my problems. she has hurt me beyond belief, yet i loved her, and i still do. my first 14 years of my life were dedicated to her, then my next 3 were about trying to recover from the damage.

 i feel empty now. not just because im without her. everybody i have poured my love into has left me. once they knew who i was they left. i have lived so many lives through so many people, but i have yet to live my own. and i do not want to.  i do not remember a single moment of my life. i do not have memories, i have facts. i know what happened, but they are not memories in my head. 

i am [REDACTED_NAME] the point where i do not remember who i am, nor my experiences. i am [REDACTED_NAME] university and i cant bring myself to talk about anything. the only thing that has stopped my from killing myself is that i havent gotten around to it. i thought at 12 i would be dead by 14. at 14 i thought id be dead at 16. at 16 i thought id be dead at 18. and now im 18. ive been expecting my death for the past 6 years and im still here because i thought i would just get hit by a car, or die in a freak accident. i didn't make plans or have aspirations because what was the point? id be dead in two years anyway. i am [REDACTED_NAME] lost in life. this first semester of uni has completely gone by and i can barley remember any of it. i started forgetting my childhood, but i was slowly losing memories that were more and more recent. and now i cant remember anything. i am [REDACTED_NAME] ready for everything to just be done. 

anyway, i highly doubt anybody is reading all of this, its really long lmao",2
zmx3l7,1671140857.0,2022-12-15 21:47:37,offmychest,I was in a relationship with a 31 year old at 13,"A little back story: When I was growing up my dad was a carefree kind and just a free spirit. He was a functional alcoholic, he would get off work and drink anywhere from a half gllon to a whole gallon of volka a night and get up at 6am and go to work. My mom and dad got divorced when I was young so I was passed back and fourth but my dads was my favorite. I was allowed to do whatever I wanted and as a teenager I took advantage of that. Dad had alot of friends and they drank too, dad was close to his brother and he had a few real close friends who was around everyday of my childhood for as long as I can remember. The one in particular I will never forget. I was young I mean like maybe 7 8 when (lets call him jim) I met Jim. He was young good looking and had been friends with dad from work. Jim and another one of dads friends lived together so they all started hanging out at my house. I had a friend over and she was a little older that day when Jim first came to my house. She was curios by him and I dont remember much about that day but I do recall Jim laying his head on her lap while she played with his hair, she gave him those flirty eyes and they sat there and talked.  Remind you even the Jim was in his late 20s and my friend was maybe 12 13 at the time. Not long after I met Jim he got into some trouble and was sent to prison for a few years.

Fast Forward>>>>>

I was 11 when I found a letter from Jim to my dad, I wasnt sure if I was even aloud to read it but I opened it up and read it anyway. I will never forget the letters that formed the word ""tell wild child I said hi."" I dont know why I got curious, I actually dont even know what I was thinking. I spent days thinksing of the letter, I guess I was lonley, I had to of felt some type of emptyness to write him back. I was 11 writting a grown ass man in prison for pulling out s gun on some guys who robbed him. Me and Jim talked about everything, he became my best friend really quick. I dont know why but I felt comfertable talking to him and telling him things that was happening with me, my friends, my boyfriend, and my family. He talked about his wife and 2 boys, he gave advice and was just very sweet, acted like he understood me and was very genuine. I now see as an adult he was manipulating me as a child but that little girl was craving for attention. We got to know eachother, we talked all the way up to the day me my dad and my friend was with us pulled up to the house after school and there Jim was sitting on our pourch, just chilling. Thats when things got confusing and fucked up. I hate telling this story it is so hard for me to realize what he was doing to me the whole time.. I dont really wanna get into the specifics. Um.. we Got close when he got out, He touched me multiple times, also touched my friends. He gave me a ring at one point, Jim was 31 years old I was 13 years old. It wasnt right and i hate that it went on as long as it did. he would kiss me when my dad wasnt around and tell me he loved me. Until the night it all ended. My friend came over while Jim was there I had a boyfriend over and supposedly Jim raped her when I wasnt in the room. There was hickeys on her neck and she was partying and drinking like a rockstar when I left her. I still have no idea what happened that night we even remained friends for a long time after and she never talked about it. I confessed to her that he was doing the same shit to me he had been touching me for almost a year. She eventually did go to the police that night and she told them about me and everything that was happening. The police charged Jim with 2 counts of sexual imposition with a minor and 1 count rape he got 6 years. I always felt so guilty for sending him to prison, I hated that I had to tell I was ashamed of what he did to me but I was a child. When Jim had 6 months left in his sentence he killed himself in prison. I still dont know if that is true, how he died but I have had to go through years of trying to accept this in my past and live life to the fullest everyday without the reminder of what Jim did to me. I still cant tell you how it affected me, I guess it did in all kinds of ways and me wanting the attention in the first place makes me wonder. All of it is in the past and I have tried my whole life to forgive myself for my part in his death. I was 13. My dad didnt care. he was asleep when the event happened with my friend, he had no idea, he was fuckin clueless. I wanted to tell some of my story. it goes farther than this but i needed to get it out into the world.",6
1csbad6,1715743632.0,2024-05-15 03:27:12,offmychest,I finally realized why there’s no pictures of the sun and I feel like an idiot.,"My whole life it has angered me that no one has taken a picture of the Sun. Every time you see a picture of the Sun, it is in infrared, or an artist depiction, or black and white etc. and it’s always angered me. Why not just snap a picture of the Sun from space? Why is it so hard to just take a picture of the Sun so I can see what it looks like?

Well today I finally found a picture and it all hit me. The Sun is a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb so large that it makes up over 90% of our solar system. It is a nuclear bomb so big it’s been exploding for billions of years. 

The picture is just a white screen with a black vignette around it. 

I had never considered that something as bright as the sun cannot be photographed by regular cameras because the light just drowns out the entire photo. Not only that but you can’t see anything around the sun because the exposure makes everything around it black. 

The sun is a just ball of white light. 

Every picture is in infrared so we can see what’s actually going on under the cosmic beam of light blasting Earth at all times. 

I have complained to numerous people over the last DECADE, and even thought of conspiracies to explain why no one has taken a picture of the Sun. I have legitimately pondered this question for the better half of my life and I just realized today that the answer is so incredibly simple, that I have never felt this stupid before and I just wanted to tell someone. 

I am [REDACTED_NAME]. 

Edit: Yes I am [REDACTED_NAME] that there are indeed pictures of the Sun taken in the visible light spectrum. That’s the realization I had relating to the title. I realized the reason there was no pictures of the Sun was because I didn’t know that there WAS pictures of the Sun and I was too stupid to realize what I was looking at. ",1844
y0izqu,1665418992.0,2022-10-10 16:23:12,offmychest,"I don't know if I'm too sensitive, or if it's the environment I'm in","I'll start by telling y'all what I went through in school and at home and then stuff that later on happened from then to most recent and how I feel

Sorry if my grammar isn't good or if I make some spelling mistakes.

I, 17 female, have been dealing with some problems  throughout almost all my life. 

When I was 9 years old I was suicidal. The reasons why I thought I was, was because I got bullied a lot. Years later I realized I was not only that, but it was also my family.

When I was in elementary, my mom had to work at the hospital. She was a respiratory therapist. She would always come home late at night and go straight to bed. So she didn't know what was going on at the house. It worried me as a kid because she didn't eat anything, just went straight to bed.

My uncle worked at a company, all I know about his job is that he can sometimes fix computers.
 He was always angry when my sister(18rn) and I would do the smallest things. If there was 1 piece of paper on the floor, if we accidently break something,  even if we write one letter in cursive and not the whole thing, he'll go on a rant about what we did and then change the subject about something else involving something ""bad"" we do. He was always this way when we were young to the point there was I time I thought he was joking but it turned it out he wasn't and I got a mouthful. He was so scary to us to the point we would cry when he yelled at us.

My sister, back then, never really stood up for me it felt like she never liked me and always had a problem with me. And at the time I thought she hated me. She was like this from 3rd grade to 7th grade

When I was at school ( elementary), most of the boys were perverts or straight up assholes. When we ( my sis and I) were in I believe 1st- 3rd grade, some of the boys would look up girls skirts and say ""I can see your underwear"" just to embarrass them. The assholes of the boys would sometimes just straight up bully people. Most of the kids were nothing but scary in elementary.

I would cut myself with plastic utensils when I was in the playground, I don't know why but at that time I was upset at myself. 2 of my friends( both female) caught me doing this, one pinned me to the ground, the other got our coach. I went to the office and had to talk to the counselor about what was going on

The counselor informed my mother that I should go to a mental hospital and come back when I feel better.

When I was back from the mental hospital I was still suicidal because the nurses didn't do shit 

Later on there were rumors about me being ""Possessed"".

 I think how it happened was because I talked to my friends about how it was at the hospital and I mentioned how one of the nurses acted like I was possessed. 
My only guess was that someone heard our conversation and thought ""hurting yourself isn't normal they Must be possessed"".

Because of that I got bullied a lot in elementary.

I then got bullied for my weight in middle school.

I became homeschooled because of the drugs at middle school and how the teachers covered it up unless you were the parent of one of the kids hiding the drugs. 

My mental health got better and I had lost a lot of weight ever since I left public school. I also got along well with my sister to the point we played games together and we bonded really well.

 My uncle wasn't an asshole when I was around 14. He in fact never remembered him being mad at the little things. Turns out it was the medication he was taking that made him angry and when he is off the medication he will forget the stuff he said when he was on the medication.

My mom quit her job at being a respiratory therapist  and became a crossing guard. She has bonded a lot more with us this way. And we communicate a lot better.

My mental health got worse when my grandpa moved in. (I was 15)

He is, in short, a drunk. He was a bad liar, he would fall down a lot and on some occasions he would be bleeding too. He also had seizures because of his drinking.

I used to help him out but now my family, mostly my sister, won't let me and for good reason.

When I did helped him out there would mostly be blood on my hands. I would wash my hands even if there wasn't. I would also have flashbacks of blood on my hands when picking up or helping people stand too.

There were times me and my sister had to clean up after him. When we cleaned his room there would be a lot of vodka bottles and his room stills smells like urine.

One time I had to take a bucket full of piss and throw it In a dumpster. And there was another time I also had throw away trash that had puke.

Needless to say I wasn't doing so well after that. I felt like I needed to take 4 showers because of that shit. 

And the worse of it all.

My uncle and mom wants me to play nice.

PLAY NICE!?

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a psychiatrist but I know damn sure that I am [REDACTED_NAME] because of him.

And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] living through this stuff. Ever since my grandpa moved in and stuff like this has happened I feel a lot more sensitive.

If someone yells at me I cry.

If I forget to do something and upset someone because of it I cry.

I haven't cut myself for at least 4 years and now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that urge. I don't know what to do.

I feel like it might be the environment I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that is making me sensitive and making me cry a lot.

I want to talk to a therapist but I don't have a job or the money.

And although it makes me mad that my mom wants me to play nice, she's only doing that because she doesn't want any drama starting. She had always protected me throughout all of this. She didn't even know about the piss bucket and throw up I had to throw away. She was furious when she found out about that and would take us out to get out of the house. She would also do this if something similar happened.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] cps will be involved and I don't want that.

What do I do? Am I too sensitive? Or is it the environment?

Thank you for listening to my story.",1
1how4hb,1735479309.0,2024-12-29 13:35:09,offmychest,I never realized how privileged I really am,"TW - parental abuse and neglect

I (26 F) grew up in a very small town with a huge family. I am [REDACTED_NAME] child in a nine child family. We were always one tragedy away from foster care. My mother mentally just checked out and our father was an alcoholic who turned physically abusive. 

My oldest brother left as soon as he turned 18 and never looked back. Got a full ride to college on football. His leaving broke my mother completely she just started existing after that. Fully ignored all of the children. 

Drew (2nd oldest) just took over the next day. Overnight he was our parent even though he was just 15 yrs old. He earned money however he could. Took our responsibility completely - went to our meetings, came to our games and plays, got us through everything. I have no idea how he did it but he did. 

I never considered myself privileged until I got into med school and came to the city. Everytime the CPS bought in a child, I realized how good I had it.

My father was abusive but Drew never let him beat any of us. We were poor as hell but our brother made sure we were always clothed and fed.He worked everyday but he still showed up at whatever we did - plays, exhibitions, games. We always had a cake for birthday and presents for Christmas. our mother never even picked the younger ones but my brother made sure we all knew that we were loved and worth it. Most of all, even though we had nothing, my brother gave us the freedom and confidence to dream. I am a doctor, my siblings followed their dreams to from  law to modeling. We all did it. 

My brother gave up everything to make sure that we became something. He stayed in closet for years until all of us were out of the town. I am [REDACTED_NAME] fucking privileged because I have a brother who broke the cycle for all of us ",2383
wgwdgs,1659708369.0,2022-08-05 14:06:09,offmychest,In need of constant validation,"It is a long story, so I hope you are patient. I am [REDACTED_NAME] my 50s and have a family - a wife, two grown up children, reasonably well settled in life. From my early childhood I have been very ambitious. As a result I have taken on ambitious projects with zero results to show for it. My ambitions far outstrip my abilities. Any project I take up, whether it is a professional one or one in my personal life, I can't think small. I can't think of what needs to be done here and now; instead I think of boiling the ocean. The results are very predictable. I end up failing to do even the simplest of the tasks. I get bored of mundane work and seek novelty and interesting tasks - which stop being interesting after a while. I still believe my best days are yet to come and I have something to contribute to the humanity which has given me so much. So I will keep striving to find myself and live up to my true potential to my last day.

One of my earliest memories is that of my mother admonishing for picking my nose. I must have been 3 or 4 and I was sleeping next to her. She noticed I was picking my nose and she got disgusted. She scolded me and sent me over to sleep next to my dad. I cried myself to sleep. I still remember that event very vividly. It was a very traumatizing experience. I have never been able to overcome that nose picking habit. Of course I don't do it in public, but it persists.

I was sexually abused by a couple of my relatives. One was male and the other female. It started when I was just 2 or 3 and continued well into my early teens, especially with my male relative. This was not traumatic in the sense that I willingly participated and somehow knew to hide it from other adults. I don't know if my subsequent sex and porn addiction had anything to do with it. I am [REDACTED_NAME] narrating to make sure I give you a complete picture.

Otherwise my childhood was pretty normal. I grew up playing with lots of other kids; I had no siblings of my own. I was pretty good academically up to my high school graduation, so I was always at the top or near the top in my class. It was a different story once I went to study electrical engineering and I struggled. Even so I finished in four years and got a very good job right off campus, so it was alright.

From my teenage years, I have found it hard to maintain good friendships. Even those who persisted with me for decades eventually gave up and stopped interacting with me. It has happened again and again. For a long time I blamed it on others. It is their fault, they failed to see the good person that I am [REDACTED_NAME] so on. In that respect I am [REDACTED_NAME] similar to my mother. She has suffered chronic inferiority complex due to her childhood issues and people end up shunning her. She has become very bitter in her 70s and now she is all alone because my father passed away recently.

I had a lot of difficulty in developing friendships with girls of my age. I was a different person at that time; very arrogant and sometimes even insulting. By the time I learned about emotional intelligence and getting along with others, I was well into my 30s. I had a couple of short term relationships in the meanwhile, but none of them satisfactory. There was one girl I was madly in love with, but unfortunately she was way out of my league. But she was kind enough to give my proposal a serious consideration. I literally had palpitations for a couple of nights after she said no; I could barely get any sleep. I was in total denial - I thought I could somehow convince her to reconsider. Her rejection was a very bitter pill; I suffered serious psychosomatic effects for many years. Even today I think about her. In retrospect it was a good decision from her perspective; she wouldn't have been happy with me.

Once I started working I began noticing a pattern: my colleagues had no difficulty getting other jobs though they were no better than my in the work we did. It took me twice as long to find the next job. In the initial years my inability to focus on tasks and get meaningful work done was hidden because people don't expect much from you when you are young. However, as I started taking on more responsible positions my failures became more obvious. I started my own company and, as a CEO, I was a spectacular failure. However, my young partners were very enterprising and eventually they got fed up and sent me packing. I moved on and found a job. My inability to focus and deliver persists to this day and I have not met any of my career or personal objectives though I have always set myself ambitious goals.

I eventually found love and married someone who is still my wife. Our relationship has been rocky but she has persisted. Now we are husband and wife in name only. I am [REDACTED_NAME] amazed that she is still with me though she has threatened to leave many times. For most of our married life, I was not an easy person to live with but always believed I was right. After a lot of reflection and thought, I have realized mostly I am [REDACTED_NAME] fault and I need to make amendments. Relations with my children are cordial but I would not describe them as warm. Their relationship with me is similar to mine with my mother which is out of a sense of duty rather than true love.

I have done many things in my life to improve myself: starting with attending Landmark workshops to reading books like ""I am [REDACTED_NAME] you are ok"", ""7 habits of highly effective people"", ""Emotional Intelligence"", ""Grit"" and many many more. I have seriously tried meditation. Nothing has helped. I recently sought counseling and consulted for several months. But I realized that their counseling is not useful because they are not trained to do deep psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. My issues are probably much deeper.

I have always known that I seek approval form others, I just didn't know why. I would find even the smallest of insults, someone just pulling my leg, enough of a reason to get very upset. Of course, over the years I have matured and consciously deal with such situations, but it is still hard. The reality is that people don't want to validate others. They have their own lives to live and have no time to think of others' issues or understand why someone behaves the way they do. I didn't understand my own personality or behavior patterns so it is a tall order for someone else to do so.

I have sought help from my close friends, family members and others. Without actually knowing I needed help, I talked honestly about my feelings and behaviors in group settings as far back as my early 20s. However, such talk makes people uncomfortable. They either deny that you are as bad as you say you are, or just keep quiet.

Another issue I have faced all my life is addiction. At various times, I have been addicted to reading fiction, porn and sex, watching videos online etc. It is those videos that keep me occupied these days. I need constant distraction from work and sometimes even from other distractions. It is really pathological. Given this level of propensity for distraction I have lost the capability to think deeply about anything whether it is professional or personal work. It clearly reflects in how I do things. There is no wonder that my managers, coworkers etc perceive me as incompetent.

I know I am [REDACTED_NAME] now, so let me come to the punch line, or the punch paragraph. I listen to Huberman Lab podcast. In one such podcast, Dr. Huberman focused on dopamine and its impact on our lives. He explains how certain foods, drugs, experiences increase the dopamine levels in the body. How it regulates mood and motivation and baseline levels, effects of crashing dopamine etc. (If you haven't listened to Dr. Huberman, please do. He is an amazing scientist and a great human being). That got me thinking. Is there a possibility that I have a chronic deficiency in dopamine? Once I was talking to my son about my lack of motivation and focus and he immediately said, you probably lack dopamine.

After thinking about it for many years, I decided to experiment with marijuana. After several attempts, once I had a dose that had a big impact on me but it was not you might expect. Immediately after consuming it, I didn't feel anything different; just a mild high similar to drinking alcohol. But soon after I felt very depressed and completely lacked motivation to do anything. At the same time I received a call from a dear friend who had not called in months. Usually I would be very happy to talk to him, but in this case I just had no interest. I immediately realized it was the dopamine crash. My dopamine regulation is somehow defective. My 23andme report says I potentially have a gene defect that causes chronic dopamine deficiency. That could explain why I need constant distractions; moving from one task to another, one stimulation to another because I am [REDACTED_NAME] low on dopamine. I seek approval from others because that is known to increase dopamine levels. I am a very sensitive person and can't tolerate even minor insults because of the same reasons.

Currently I am [REDACTED_NAME] with many different things to keep my dopamine levels in check: I take phenylethylamine or PEA supplement. I have tried cold showers. Tried to reduce my frequent consumption of social media and youtube. It is an on-going struggle. I may again get back into counseling, this time with a psychotherapist who can go deeper into my childhood and provide better tools.

If you are still with me, my sincere thanks to you. I do hope I can make some friends here. There is also a part of me which seeks your likes and approval. Most importantly I hope my story helps others to develop some insights into their own situations if they are similar.

Signing off for now.",2

 I was born in China and lived there for 7 years until I moved to America. Around when I was 6 or 7 I was invited to my friend’s house for a play date. There I was molested by 2 teenagers male and female (I never found out who they are). That memory felt like a fever dream but I still clearly remember where they laid their hands on me. As kid I never felt like I’m traumatized by it but I did developed anxiety and fear later on in life when talking the opposite sex.  But I do know from the start that something was wrong. Is was later in life that I realized that I was molest and raped. Ever since that I felt shamed of myself; I grew up in a strict Asian family so I never expressed my emotions to anyone. as I got into my high school years one of the teachers did notice my depression and anxiety after I tried so hard to hide it. The school pretty much force my parents to take me therapy once a week. During that time I lied about everything I blamed it on my lack of self esteem and bullshit my way throughout the session because I’m too embarrassed and shamed to tell my story. I had pretend like I’m getting better every week and put on a smile everyday just to get out of the impression I’m getting better and happy again. I don’t know what I might do to myself and I’m scared I thought about ending it all this week and I snap my way out of it when I was thinking about the consequence and how it could be devastating to my family. I still have the option still in my head. I li scared that one day I might actually break down and life gets the better of me  and I end it all.

First of all im a guy. Since i was young i was a very quiet kid, wasnt into footbal and baseball, didn't made much friends and liked simple things like walking and looking at animals and nature. And when i was 16 my dad was very concerned of me turning into a homossexual because he's from a very conservative family. He and my mother divorced when i was 10 but i kept contact with both. 
To ""fix"" this, he invited me to sleep at his place on a friday, of course i accepted and went to his house. Immediately when i arrived he offered me a can of beer saying ""first beer has to be with you dad eh?"", and i drank it with him. I dknt remember exactly but 5 cans in i was boozed up and he asked if i was a virgin, i said yes and he told me a friend of his was already coming over to fix that, i thought he was joking and played along saying something like ""haha lets see"". I did not wanted to have sex in any way whatsoever. 
A few minutes pass by and there's a knock on the door, he opens and she comes inside, a 40ish yo woman that smelt of cigarettes, she wasn't a hooker because i remember him talking about her.
At this point im so boozed that i pretend that she's not there, he tells me he ""has to go somewhere "" and leaves us two alone. She lit a cigarette and started chatting with me, i was almost one with the couch when she got close and deep tongue kissed me, and i kissed her back not really knowing what to do, she massaged my dick and it obviously got hard. She took my pants off and blew me, afterwards she was riding me while i was thinking what the hell i was doing, she told me to drink another beer to enjoy the moment and so i did. eventually she pulled me into his bed and we started fucking like animals because i was already fucked up and honestly i had given up.
A few minutes later my dad comes back and he fucking joins us i kid you not, he started fucking her mouth while i fucked her and vice versa. She was very loose and i could barely feel anything, after a few minutes she told me it was safe to cum inside her, so i rushed to do it and i did, the post nut clarity hit my drunken mind.
What the fuck i was doing, i could be at my house playing games or some shit, did i just lose my virginity to a 40ish woman that stinked of cigarettes? 
It was absolutely disgusting smelling the air after i came and hearing my dad moaning along with her.
I immediately left the room, i took a shower and forced myself to sleep in the guest room hearing him still fucking her.
It's been 6 years since and dad still brags about it to his friends saying ""no dad in the world would do that hahaha"", and i find it absolutely disgusting. 
I have never even chased after sex since because it makes me repulsive remembering that dammed day.
Nowadays I'm [REDACTED_NAME] interested in boys than i am [REDACTED_NAME]  girls, but not in a sexual manner.
Sorry for bad typos, it's the first time i say this to anyone.

TL:DR = Dad got me drunk when i was 16, called his 40ish yo friend to take my virginity, and so she did. He joined midsex and fucked her along with me, i came and all the beer got erased from my body as i realized what i had done. I forced myself to sleep and cannot even chase after sex today.",3110
xizsi0,1663650679.0,2022-09-20 05:11:19,offmychest,Childhood trauma,"I am [REDACTED_NAME] to put in a wall of text here, in the hopes that someone will read it and point me in the direction of some kind of help. Maybe you even have advice yourself, who knows? Maybe I will feel better just getting it out there. Just so you're warned in advance.


I'm a 30 year old guy, and I've been dealing with this trauma since my early teens. My parents got divorced when I was 12 and things were fine for about half a year. Then my mother decided to move back to the other end of the country, where she's from, and brought me and my two younger brothers with her. Of course I hated her for it and grieved for years. When I was crying after the move, she told me to suck it up and stop feeling sorry for myself. When I told her I didn't want to go, she made fun of me.


Eventually I got used to missing my father, grandparents and my old friends. I still saw them every other weekend when I visited my father, and I found new friends and actually was pretty good until I turned 15. I had some run-ins with my mother's deadbeat boyfriends, but nothing serious. 


At that point my father asked me if I wanted to come live with him, while visiting a weekend. I instinctively said yes, and immediately regretted it. I hadn't noticed how I'd gotten used to my old life. But I felt that I couldn't tell anyone for fear of hurting him. In the following months it dawned on me what I was giving up for a life that no longer existed: my family, friends and my old self. I had a constant stomach-ache. Immediately when the move was finished, I felt like I had killed a part of myself and that I deserved it for deserting my mother and my siblings and moving away from my friends. The two years I lived there, the ache never stopped and I hated myself every single day. The guilt soon brought on a depression and my personality changed completely. I no longer cared about school. I had previously been extremely studious and conscientious. I became vain and arrogant, showered by the gifts t my father and his wife spoiled me with. My sense of self was gone and in its place was sheer contempt and anger. 


Due to this change in personality I became very popular with teens my age, but I was hard to be around. At home, especially.


My father and his wife were constantly irritated with me, for forgetting their house-rules. Depression affects your memory. Where I'd been polite and happily done my chores at my mother's, I didn't have the energy to even pick up my carefully folded clothes and put them away in the closet. My father reacted by telling me that I was being disrespectful to his wife and on one occasion he asked me where the old me had gone. The boy he loved so much.


The time I spent with him while there was really the only positive about the move and I loved it. But he soon told me that his wife was jealous of the time we spent together, so I would have to try and include her. I realize now that we were having a power-struggle, me and her, but I don't remember any of the particulars.


We soon clashed when one night after dinner, she stood up and started delegating chores for me. I thought it was odd that it wasn't my father doing this, but I didn't mind. I really wanted to live up to their expectations. It was all fine, until she said she wanted me to ""sometimes ask if there is anything I can help with"". Now that would have been all fine if it weren't for our ongoing conflict. I immediately knew that this was her going back to that struggle, showing her power over me. Even though it seems innocuous enough in writing, I am [REDACTED_NAME] stupid. Even as a kid I was extremely perceptive and I know perfectly well that I was exactly on the money. This meant that I would never be done with chores and she always had a reason to be unhappy, if I hadn't asked enough. Being that I was destroyed inside I didn't have the power to stand up for myself and I crumbled. All I could do was cry. So I had a full-on hyperventilating panic-attack, while she stomped out of the kitchen. My father soon followed, swearing and yelling about ""those fucking spoiled kids"". We never talked about it since.


Seeing as how the situation was out of my control, I called my mom to ask for help. She told me she would call my father.


The next day he sat me down and yelled about how he wasn't a bad father. The dumb kid that I was, I carefully tried to suggest his wife (then girlfriend) moved back to her old apartment. It was then my father decided to tell me that if it weren't for her, he'd hung himself in the toolshed when we moved. I gave up at that point. Turned around back to my computer screen.


A couple of weeks later, I told him that I'd like to move back to my mother's. He just said ""ok"" and that was it. We never talked about it and I left all of my friends and my life once more to move back. I still feel so bad. The friends I had there were some of the best I've ever had and I just left them without trying to keep our friendships alive. I'd already experienced what it feels like for friendships to run out into the sand. It's excruciating.  


Back at my mother's I noticed how my siblings had grown without me being there. We no longer had the tight bonds we used to and I feel the regret to this day. I've tried to get closer to them for years, but it isn't happening. The same with my relationship with my mother. I used to be able to talk to her about things and hash out my feelings. We used to fight and we would make up afterwards. Since moving back and forth it's just been awkward. Every time I've tried to talk to her about something since it has felt unsatisfying. My friendship with my father is ruined as well. He used to be my best friend. 


I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the same person anymore. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the person I was before nor after the moving. I'm [REDACTED_NAME], unproductive, sad. I've had to fight tooth and nail, to just function and be a decent human being. I've flunked out of university twice. I've spent four years on well-fare. Eventually I got my degree, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I worry constantly. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] anti-depressants and I've been in contact with mental healthcare in my country since I was 15. I've never had the trust or opportunity to tell these things to anyone. I don't want to be told to man up and stop whining.


At 19 I got diagnosed with Schizotypal PD and I suspect that this is the reason that none of the several psychologists, nurses and psychiatrists have asked or been interested in my story. Unless I'm [REDACTED_NAME] anti-psychotic medication, they simply don't want to talk to me. The response when I've tried to bring up my past is: ""you think too much"", ""we might be able to talk about that some time"" and any other deflection. My current psychologist has been on sick leave since April and no psychologist in the private sector wants me as a patient because of my diagnosis.


Now I've been awake the whole night for the 10th time maybe this month and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of myself. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] broken.


My relationships with my parents and siblings are better, but we never talk about the past. I've tried talking to my parents of course, but I don't have the strength to force it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of what they'll say the next time I ask for help. Will it be: ""man up and stop feeling sorry for yourself"", or will it be ""I'll go hang myself in the toolshed"".


I don't want this to be a story about how I eventually killed myself, I don't have a choice but to try and deal with it somehow, because more than anything else, I don't want my story to be one about how I was broken as a teen and was never able to live anything but a life wasted. How do I talk to my parents?


TLDR: need advice on how to have a fruitful conversation with my parents about my childhood trauma.",1

It’s still my go-to for shit like toothbrushes. However, I remember looking in my father’s camping backpack he had in the Seventies and discovered a pink comb. I kinda giggled and said, Daddy WTF is this?! 

He explained to me pink is his favorite color. Not Crayon pink; pink from sunsets after a rain when the sun illuminates off the clouds. That pink sunrise when you’re starting a brand new day, a fresh start. That wispy pink and grey hue that ribbons through the sky.

Tonight was a beautiful sunset in Sacramento, California and as my dad says, “It’s all *free.*” If you haven’t experienced a breathtaking sunrise or sunset in a while, do yourself a favor and go experience one.",3168
hd20tu,1592720485.0,2020-06-21 06:21:25,offmychest,"I think I'm catching feelings for my cousin, and I dont know what to do.","I made a burner account to post this since I don't want anyone I know to see this, and keep in mind I've never written anything like this so bear with me.

I (m, 15) think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to develop a crush on my cousin (f, 15) and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] scared because I don't know what to do, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] she won't want to do anything with me because we're cousins and our family is catholic. I also don't want to try to do anything with her because I feel like it's wrong anyways. 

So on to the backstory of how I began to like her. My moms side of the family is very large, and my great grandmother began a tradition where every summer our entire family (around 20 to 30 people is my guess, but a lot of people don't end up going every year) go to a house near a beach for a week. My cousin, who I'll refer to as Hannah, has been there for  every year I can remember, and I've never felt attraction of any sort to her before this years vacation. Up until this year, I actually never knew that she was the same age as me, and thought she was a few years younger. I never thought of Hannah as physically attractive, and never really got to know anything about her personality, because I hung out around my male cousins most of the time. This year was different though. Her once short, thin, shoulder length hair was now thicker, and longer, which I find more attractive. She also used to have braces (which I have no problem with, but they didn't look very good on her) but now that she has them off, there's something about her teeth and smile thats really cute. She also just seemed more mature looking too. Anyways, I found out that she was the same age as me one day when I was talking to her mother about school and life in general. Her mom just asked me what grade I was in, and she said ""oh, Hannah is jn the same grade as you"" and I was kind of shocked. While this didn't make me feel more attracted to her, I felt like I should talk to her a bit more since she was my age. When I was about to go downstairs to go to sleep, she was sitting on the couch on her phone, and looked up at me, and we ended up just saying hi and everything, asking what eachother were up to, and then said goodnight. Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] socially awkward, so I felt pretty nervous even saying hi to her, and the whole thing just seemed awkward. After that though, I suddenly kept thinking about her even though I didnt know why. Everytime I saw her I felt awkward and nervous. After this, nothing much happened for the next day except for me maybe saying a few words to her now and then. We have a hot tub outside of the house that we were staying in, and after I came back from the beach, I decided to hop in. Hannah was in there already, but I didn't feel as nervous because I was with my other male cousin, who kind of constantly follows me around, so while it was nice having him there, I wish he wasn't. So when we were in the hot tub, I think one of the first questions she asked us when we were talking was if we had a girlfriend. I think this was the first moment where I realized I actually might like her. I dont know why, but it just was. Right after I said that I didn't, some other cousins came in the hot tub, so we couldn't really talk about that stuff anymore. That question really got me thinking though, and now that I thought about it, I realized that every time we saw each other, she seemed to nervous to talk to me, but she would always give me this really cute smile. Fast forward another day, and I honestly forget what happened in between these days, but I dont think much of anything relevant happened. Except for us saying hi or something now and then. For the first few nights I had shared a bed with my male cousin because there wasn't enough space for everyone to have a bed, but the problem with this was that he moved a lot in his sleep, and jabbed me and took the covers a lot. I didnt feel like getting jabbed this night, so I decided to sleep on the upstairs couch, and was laying up there on my phone, while mostly everyone except for my mom and Hannah's mom had gone to their rooms, or something. I felt pretty tired, so I just closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but then I opened my eyes, and to my surprise, Hannah was right there on the couch next to me (think of the couches as making an L shape). I saw her, and smiled, and she gave me her cute smile back. I closed my eyes again, but couldn't go to sleep knowing she was right there on her phone. At this point, I was wondering if she wanted to talk to me, and that's why she chose to sit on the couch next to me, instead of any other one. I decided to open my eyes, sit up, and start talking to her. We talked about random stuff, nothing deep or personal, for a little while. She ended up asking me for my number and we continued to talk for maybe 20 minutes or so, until my brother came upstairs and started goofing around with me. I felt too shy to talk to Hannah with my brother around, so I ended up just messing around with my brother for the next 10 minutes, until my mom said we were being too loud and told us to go to bed. I said that I wanted to sleep on the couch upstairs (so I could talk to Hannah more) and my mom said ok. I went to our room to get my pillow and brush my teeth, but when I came upstairs, Hannah was gone. It was at this point where I started to really think she might like me, because the instant I was gone, she left. I texted her asking if she was going to sleep, but she said she was on the middle floor on her phone. I asked her is she wanted to come upstairs and talk more, and she said yes. We talked about a lot of stuff, like school, and sports, and previous heartbreak, and how I never had a gf, and it ended up getting really deep. The way she was talking this whole time was really cute, and I learned that she too felt really socially awkward and didn't have many friends. On almost every topic we covered, she related to me like no girl I had ever met. I felt so connected to her. It was about 2:30 in the morning when a group of my other cousins came upstairs to get food or something. They had all been drinking a bit too, and are all underage. Hannah and I felt too awkward to talk about the stuff we were just talking about at this point, and just started to text eachother. She said she wanted to go down to the middle floor and talk more, so we did, until she said she felt the urge to make food, so we went back upstairs and she said she was going to make eggs. I told her I hated eggs, and she suddenly said she didn't want to make them anymore, even though she wasn't going to make any for me (or at least I think). I asked her if she was sure and she said yea. Most of the other cousins who came upstairs just fell asleep, and Hannah said she was going to as well. I said goodnight, and fell asleep (this was around 3:30). I woke up at around 7, and came downstairs a bit later and saw her on the middle floor on her phoneon the couch. We ended up talking until we had to go eat brunch with the whole family at around 10, and didn't really talk much after that for the day. She also fell asleep early so I couldn't talk to her. I saw her sleeping and couldn't help but think about how cute she looked asleep. Although I was sad we couldn't talk that night, my heart felt fuzzy just seeing her sleep. Its not like a was staring at her, I just walked past her to get to the couch where I fell asleep again. Again, we didn't talk the next day, or at night, because she said she was watching a show with the female cousins until 4 in the morning. I was leaving the next morning and was able to talk to her for a bit, but when I told her I was leaving that day she looked really upset, because she was leaving the next day. My mom needed my help packing clothes, so off I went to do that. I came back and Hannah asked me if I wanted to walk to the beach really quick. We just went out and she checked the ocean to see if the waves were any good, and turned back. I felt like this was my last chance to talk to her though, so I asked if she wanted to walk down the beach for a little bit. We did, and I just felt like I was floating the whole time. When we got back, I talked to her some more, and then had to go help again. I was a bit sad, but happy I got to talk to her some more. I was saying my goodbyes to all the other cousins, but Hannah kept following me around, standing in an awkward, but cute way. I felt like she wanted to tell me something, but I didn't know what it was. After we began to drive away, I saw that she texted me ""hi :)"" and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that was from when she was trying to tell me something. I asked her about it, but she didn't really give me a straight answer. I dont know what this means, but I'd rather stop thinking about it, because I won't see her again until this winter. 

Thanks for reading my story, I just wanted to get it all out. Also, I would greatly appreciate it if someone could tell me what this means, as in if she likes me back or not. I don't really know if I should have feelings for her or not, because she is a distant cousin, but still a cousin, and I couldn't really see her other than once in the summer and once in the winter anyways.

EDIT - I forgot to add that during our late night conversation she seemed to be pretty flirty and was complimenting my hair and other stuff throughout the night. That was another reason I thought she might like me.",5
wlkt0j,1660201049.0,2022-08-11 06:57:29,offmychest,Sifting Through the Ashes,"In the days preceding my surgery, I had gone down the internet rabbit hole into surgical complications. I was having surgery to remove a tumor. It was benign, but still needed to be removed. I read up on anesthesia, clots, infections, strokes, and all other manner of dreadful circumstances that could befall me.  It just so happened that my stepfather was having a similar surgery on his own tumor on the same day as mine. My level of concern did not extend to his operation, or the repercussions therein.

In all honesty, I didn't care about him. There was no love within our relationship. I can only speak for my side, so I will not claim to speak for him. His abusive nature could have hidden the affection, just as his father had withheld it from him. I was always under the microscope, nit-picked for the slightest transgressions. While the physical abuse wasn't extreme, the damage had been done through the environment of fear he created. There was no healing the rift between us, but things between us had started to get better. I had turned sixteen and was suddenly on his eye level. With my older siblings out of the house, it was just him, my mom, and myself. We stayed out of each other's life, and things were manageable.

I went in for my operation first. The nervous energy ebbed as I was prepped and maneuvered into the surgical theater. My last thoughts as I counted back from 10 was my recently departed grandmother.

""Treasure this life. It's the only one you have, and it can be gone in an instant."" Her words drifted through the ether; whispers only I could hear as the world went black.

\*\*\*

I made it through without any issues. 

""The osteoid osteoma was removed without complication. You will need to wear this cast for the next few months, and you should avoid walking as much for the first few days."" The surgeon went over a list of things to watch for, to monitor, and then a list of things to seek immediate emergency assistance with. The worry I felt was gone. The chance of any of those bad things happening is very low. I felt reassured. 

After picking up my prescriptions, my dad brought me home to my Mom's house. My parents had divorced when I was young, and it took awhile for them to form a working co-parenting relationship. We ordered pizza, I played some video games while he watched TV upstairs, and we enjoyed the quiet. My mom called him as we got settled to let him know my stepdad's surgery was done, but there was issues bringing him out of the anesthesia. I didn't think anything of it at the time.

 When my Dad told me later that my Mom would not be home that night, I was told it was only due to an abundance of caution. They were still planning to discharge him the next morning, and would be home by noon.

""Okay. Thanks for letting me know. Are you spending the night?"" I asked him, but he shook his head. After a serious fall the year before, my father had nearly died. He was still suffering from the effects, and he said he could only sleep well in his own bed. Anyways, I was sixteen and could always call him if I needed him.

After his truck pulled out of the driveway, I hobbled over to my computer to check if I got a message on AIM. I'd met a girl I'd met while playing Starcraft and wanted to see if she was online. I'd just missed her, so I took my Vicodin and went to sleep instead.

\*\*\*

I awoke the next day to the smell of bacon, eggs, and hash browns. I tore into the delicious breakfast my Dad had prepared. We didn't chat while we ate. We each read the paper, exchanging sections as we finished them. It was nice to see my dad getting his appetite back, although his weight was still drastically under where he was before the fall. I saw the frailty within a body that had previously exuded strength. I knew he suffered with pain, and saw it in his face as he scrubbed the cast iron pan.

He wasn't one to share that pain unless it became unmanageable. Grabbing my crutches, I came up behind him and gave him a quick hug.

""Thanks for the breakfast Dad.""

""Uh-huh. I gotta go run a few errands, but they'll be home by noon."" 

I picked back up on the game I had started the day before. It was around 10:30. Around 12:30, my Moms car pulled into the driveway. My Mom got out of the car first, going around to the other side to open the door for my Stepfather. They walked extremely slowly to the front door, but it was apparent right away that something was wrong. At the time, I could not put my finger on it. I saw a deep, existential fear within the cold blue eyes. He did not speak to me as they came in the entryway.   


My mom came down to the stairs to give me a hug. I looked over her shoulder at him. Never did his eyes meet mine, nor did he give any indication of sensing my presence. He was lost in his thoughts, and I would have never pried. I had a short conversation with my Mom, and then went back to my game.   


An hour or so passed, and I realized I was overdue for one of my painkillers. I had taken one with breakfast, but that was nearly four hours ago and the dull pain of my surgery was starting to push through. I went in the bathroom, grabbed a glass of water, and took another pill. I was just about to sit back down when I heard a blood-curdling scream from upstairs, followed by a loud thud. In a flash, I dropped my crutches and ran upstairs. I ran up all sixteen stairs. I reached the top of the stairs and saw my stepfather twitching on the floor by the kitchen sink. Blood was pooling around his head. I do not remember hearing my Mom call 911, but I could see her on the phone. I did not offer aid to my stricken Stepfather. I did not move from the top of the stairs. I watched his life slip away as his skin grew pale and his limbs grew still. I was still frozen as the first responders rushed through the front door.   


""Can you go downstairs?"" The firefighter asked. I nodded, and went back downstairs. I stood at the windows in the basement, staring out the front window at the chaos. Most of the responders came in their personal vehicles, but eventually the ambulance and firetrucks showed up. My Stepfather had been a volunteer firefighter, an EMT, and worked as a police dispatcher, so all of the responders knew when they got the call. I heard them struggle as they carried him down the stairs and out to the waiting ambulance. The firetruck followed it out of the driveway, and then the remaining vehicles did as well. I was left alone, and I came upon the realization that my life was now irrevocably changed.  


I knew he was dead before I got the call from my Mom. Staring at the blood still seeping into the kitchen carpet, I knew he was gone. I went numb, a feeling that would persist for years following the trauma. I had come face to face with real mortality that day, and I have carried that weight with me ever since. I tried and failed to meet Death myself in the years following that event, all because of that day in September. He was 38 years old, the same age I am [REDACTED_NAME]. He seemed old when I watched him die that day. Now I realize how young he still was, and why he was so scared. He saw Death, and got to meet Him. I am [REDACTED_NAME] I did not.   


My wife and daughters sleep upstairs as I try to finally release the flood gates I've held in place for so long. It's taken me twenty-two years to finally seek help for that day. I wanted to share my story, so others may hopefully also find the way.   


Thank you for listening today.",1

Obviously I am [REDACTED_NAME] with a lot emotionally, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to get on with my life.  It's hard, because I've fully dissociated from the event, and at times her (I am [REDACTED_NAME] on seeing a psychiatrist).

But there are things that have happened, that I just didnt expect... all of my friends stopped talking to me, no one calls or texts to see see how I'm [REDACTED_NAME] or just talk about their and my day.. I've not had a text.. or a call.. in weeks. Even my best friend.. the person who told he would always be there for me.. I've heard from him twice. He leaves me on read. And why?.. because apparently no one knows what to say to me.

So I not only lost a big part of my life and heart in losing my daughter, ive now lost another part of me in losing my friends. 

And I hate it. If it wasnt for the fact that I have 2 other kids.. I'd probably just disappear to somewhere else. 

If you read this.. thanks. I needed somewhere to put these feelings.

Idk why but we’ve always just had a thing where we automatically put our calls on speakerphone whenever we’re together.

So as usual, he put his mom on speaker, unbeknownst to her and she goes, “did you see my text??” 

Bf: “uhh… no?”

Her: “well, what color of Mickey ears would she want so I can buy her some for our trip.” (they invited me to go on their Disneyland trip with them in a few weeks)

Bf, glancing over at me, grinning: “either yellow or pink.” 

She then continues by asking about our plans with his sisters and if a certain ring would be ready by the time of the trip. 

Bf: “hey mom, I gotta call you back later I’m in the middle of dinner… love ya!” 


It’s such a simple but sweet gesture that she thought to get me something for their trip to Disneyland even though they’re already paying for everything, I can’t stop smiling just thinking about it! I’m going to be marrying into an amazing family soon, and I just had to get it off my chest how ecstatic I am!!


Edit: yeah i realize that not giving someone a heads up about being on speakerphone is kind of dumb move on our end, it’s just become a norm for us, but I’ll mention that to him tonight, thanks y’all ❤️",8559
ux38v3,1653432564.0,2022-05-24 22:49:24,offmychest,Ive dealt with so much trauma my whole life and now my thoughts are too loud to ignore. TW: Abuse,"I'm [REDACTED_NAME] afraid to go to a therapist so here I am [REDACTED_NAME] reddit bc i'm [REDACTED_NAME] to lose my mind if i don't get this off of my chest. Sorry for the long post but I need to get it out when I try to talk to people who get uncomfortable and don't want to talk about it which is understandable. I don't blame them. Sorry for but i word vomited. i needed this off my chest so i don't go insane.

Feel free to AMA. I won't find it offensive, I promise.

Tl;dr: ive been abused since I was little. Sexually, emotionally, and mentally. This is just a small part of my story.

\[F21\] My life has been an absolute shit show from day one. From ages 3-6 my older sister, let's call her Elizabeth, would make me sniff her vagina if I didn't do exactly what she said. I don't really have much to add because I don't really remember much. It never escalated from there but looking back on these events it's disturbing and disgusting to me when i think back on it.

Then when I was 8 my older brother, let's call him Brock, touched me and would make out with me forcibly. He touched me while I was asleep and I only know this because one day he told me he walked in my room while I was asleep and sometimes I woke up to him touching me but I didn't do anything because I was scared. Then when we both got older he started getting more aggressive and actively trying to rape me and he was successful one day when i was about 9. No matter how hard I fought I couldn't get him off and away from me and it was continually until I was 11/12. Not only was Brock a rapist and pedophile but he was sexuallly abusive he was mentally and physically abusive. He ended up pushing me once because i stood my ground one day and said no to having sex with him and the fall i had ended up breaking my arm. He was the only one with me at the time and I asked him to help me at least get ice for my arm and he refused because ""i should be able to do it with one arm"". He felt entitled to everything I owned like my laptop and ipad. He even made himself the administrator on my computer so I couldn't update it without his permission and he didn't give me the password to it. The only person that knew the password besides himself was Elizabeth. Anytime I refused to stand my ground again threatened on multiple occasions to break everything I owned at that age. He had me convinced that i was going to be in touble for having sex with him. I was just a stupid 8-12 year old kid i didn't know any better at the time. He's about 4 years older than me and had me convinced I was the bad guy. Thank god for my parents for acting immediately and appropriately. But the next few months after that were rough. I had to talk to so many cps people and have multiple doctors appointments to get std tested and pelvic exams and pap smears. I had bacterial vaginosis at age 11/12 because of him. Still not one time did I see a therapist. 

Out of the 5 siblings I had, I've been SA by two. And the wildest part is that neither of them knew what the other was doing. Not to mention out of the 6 children I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only one who's been picked by both to be touched. I've at least forgiven my sister and we're good now. I don't want to hold her accountable for something she did before she was even 10. But I can't forget that it happened. (These 3/5 of my siblings are my half siblings and they would spend long stretched of time at their respective parents house)

Fast forward a few months my parents moved states because we all felt like a prisoner in the previous house. My parents and younger sibling moved and thing were great. The neighbors we were in was a military base and the kids and families there were good for the most part. I had to deal with some bullying along the way but I was at least not depressed. But then there's this kid who was really touchy and would go in my shirt and grab my boobs. If that wasn't happening then they play a game called firetruck and they would take their hand and slide it up your leg until they get close to your genitals and ask ""are you nervous"" the goal of the game was to have the person get closest to you genitals to ""win"" Was in the sixth grade at the time. It didn't help that this was a middle/high school combined. There was another kid who would grab and slap my ass and I was uncomfortable with it but the other females in the group were ok with it assumed at this point that it was normal. My policy was when in roam do as the romans do. I didn't know that I was just use to abuse at this point. 

In my 7th grade year I joined band and every in band was like a family. There was only 28 people in the band bc I went to a small school and we had a game called titty and ass tag. It's exactly what you would expect. Its played like normal tag but you the person who's ""it"" has to slap someone's titty to not be it. The game went on until I was in 8th grade.

While in 7th grade I my first developed a crush on someone and they liked me back. We never got together but still remain great friends to this day. But back then those female friends I hung out with encouraged us to have sex. And he was down with it but respected the fact that I wasn't. The furthest we went was touch each other minus kissing because I just thought touch and feeling other people up and having them feel you up was normal. 

8th grade my chest is very large and all I hear is some girls making fun of me for it and calling my boobs ""saggy"". Where as we have guys wanting to be with me. It wasn't uncommon for people to ask me out or try and get pictures with me so they can post it on kik. One of the females friends of mine had 2 guys she'd hand out with. One guy was very sexual and convinced her to suck his dick for free weed. And she was going to do it but got caught. That same guy tried to get me to do it, and commented multiple times that my chest size was large. And he nicked-named me double-D. One guy caught wind of that and tried to get me to have sex with him and send him nudes and he was really aggressive. There was times I though I was being stalked but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it was just my anxiety.

9th I end up having to move again and its back to that god forsaken house because my parents couldn't afford to pay rent and a mortgage and this year was smooth sailing for the most part. I was just uncomfortable living there bc I couldn't unsee the history. There was time where I couldn't stop thinking about what brock would do to me bc I was sitting in a certain spot in the house. My parents saw the toll that the history of the house had on me so we moved to another state for my 10th grade year.

10th grade mostly uneventful but at the end of this year I had to move houses yet again bc rent was getting too high and we were stuck with that hell house still. The only major even that I can think of is that I started martial arts and I really took a liking to ju-jitsu 

11th grade in a new school and I get my first boyfriend, Alex, at the beginning of the year and this year and the next year marks some of the worse in my life. I was unfortunate enough to end up with a narcissistic psychopath that was abusive mentally, emotionally, physically and sexually. He was a pathological liar and he almost messed up the relationship I had with my parents bc I was young and dumb at the time and I didn't realize what was going on. He slapped me one bc I was having fun as a passenger in a car while the driver drove 80mph in a 40mph zone during the night when the roads were clear. He said ""you shouldn't encourage that kind of behavior"" and later when I told him how it made me feel later he said ""the driver is a bumbling idiot and you were encouraging that behavior. I should've slapped you harder"" and called me a baby when I was crying after being slapped. On a Halloween he broke a rubber baseball bat on me bc I was a zombie and he was Negan from the walking dead. He really wanted me to be in character bc he was in character. I had bruises on my body for a week and I was pained to walk. Some people noticed I was getting hit but no one said anything. I don't know how he did it but I still fell I love with him and stuck with him even though he was looking at other girls. And broke up with me a few time to try and get with other girl and when was rejected came crawling back to me and still my dumb ass took him back. I've been raped by him a few times his works verbatim about rape ""I don't see what the problem with rape it. I get pleased and you pleased what's the issue?"" And he's said something like ""I don't think it should be considered rape if you've been with a person for at least 6 months."" He has choked me out until I've passed out and had sex with my passed out body. All the ju-jitsu that i knew felt useless. i tried using it and it didn't help. He would flirt (non innocent flirting) with girls in front of my face. He told me that he needed multiple girlfriends bc hes a man with sexual needs and if one is on their period he can just use the other. He likes to get inside the heads of girls and emotionally wreck them. He likes to have sex with multiple women the same day and it wasn't uncommon for him to cheat on those women he was with prior to me. He was just convinced hes better and smarter than everyone and he would blame the victim every time. If someone didn't like him he was convinced it was because they were just stupid. And the cycle of abuse was always on repeat Honeymoon phase, mean phase, make me feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] crazy one even though I'm [REDACTED_NAME] victim, and repeat. The abuse was so much for me to handle that I was lose weight at a rapid rate. That year alone I lost 90 pound bc I couldn't eat bc I always felt like I was going to throw up form my anxiety and some times I did. I've had multiple anxiety and panic attacks that year. Some so strong that I did make me vomit. There was time I legitimately was afraid for my life because hes even threated to kill me. And he always talks about how much he wanted to kill other people. There was a few times I've even tried taking my own life because the abuse was just too much.

12th grade I finally get the balls to break up with him and the break up was messy. I ""lost"" my phone right before we broke up so he gets me a new one the same day with a plan and all. And hes pulling all the stops to make sure I was in his grasps but I some how had the energy to stay strong. I had a few really good people I meet that help support me. One guy we can call Shane, another guy we can call Coby. They helped said that they would protect me if he put his hands on me again and I was over the moon this is the first time someone has ever done this before. Shane and hung out once at target bc where I live that's what you do to have fun. But Alex worked there but so did Coby so I felt safe. Until we ran into a person Shane liked her name was serria. I wouldn't have cared but Alex liked him as well. I didn't want to be caught anywhere near Shane and that girl bc I knew I would face Alex later if I was with them so i sneaked out of the store and Coby helped me with that. Shane, serria, and i hung out for the rest of the night. And when serria left Shane and i had sex. It was consensual. It was one of the first time i really felt like i did it because i wanted to and that i didn't have to. Shane said it would be a big ""fuck you to Alex"" so i did it. I felt empowered. Then i don't remember how but I started to give Coby head every now and again as another fuck you to Alex. As i write this i feel like i was taking advantage of again and didn't even realize it. 

This started and id wear very skimpy short clothing. I felt like a hoe so I started dressing the part. I was skinny and had a nice body so i showed it off. Complements and people noticing me started and one guy asked me on a date. I was over the moon yet again but he didn't take me out because he wanted a girlfriend he took me out because he want to get me to smoke with him and have sex. And i just did it. Yet again in my life i felt like i just didn't have a choice what i wanted to do with my body. I did it and felt disgusted afterwards. And the same thing happened again and again and again just with other people. I slept with about 1 different person a week. Not because i wanted to. But because they asked and i felt like i didn't have a choice. 

I met my current boyfriend right before senior year ended and when we got together i was asking for an open relationship. I felt like i just needed to have sex with multiple people even though i wanted a monogamous relationship. Im glad he was firm on not want an open relationship and he worked though all my mental and emotional problems with me. I still haven't seen a therapist but i feel like I've left my past behind. But while writing this I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to see why i still have depression and why i still act and feel the ways that i so. I've been through a lot of trauma up until this point in my life and I've left a lot of things out. These were just the ones that have made the most imprint on my life. Since I've been with him i just feel safe because all my life abusers would have to get through him first. He's my big teddy bear.

Even still my parents, current boyfriend, family member and a friends don't know the half of it. I don't want my parent to think that they've failed their job or my boyfriend to think that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] bc of my past. From what he's know he just thinks he turned a hoe into a house wife. But i don't want him to get mad. Its not other people's fault that i didn't say no sometimes. I don't even know how to tell this to a therapist without them thinking I'm a danger to myself or others. So i sit alone with my thoughts sometimes. And sometimes they are too loud and idk what to do. The way I cope is by just telling myself that i wanted something or it was my fault for not being more firm with people and i joke about it a lot. Most people probably wouldn't even think that it bothers me with the way that I talk about it and that i act so happy go lucky about everything.

No one should have to read it, because no one should go through it. I am [REDACTED_NAME] it down and posting it to make it more real for me, so I do not forget what happened and where I came from. I am [REDACTED_NAME] okay now, but it has been the struggle of a lifetime and a largely silent one.

 1.From as far as I could remember, as young as I could rememeber, my mother would have episodes where she forgot or refused to take her medication and go through a manic episode combined with heavy drinking. Reader, if you have never seen one they are terrifying and horrifying, crazed and wild. I felt like I had two mothers, and that one (my words to my mother at the time, and often) hated me.

&#x200B;

2. From as young as I could remember, my mother struggled to take her anti-psychotics. She resented it, very loudly, and if she took it too late it mixed with the alcohol and changed or dimished the medicine. She also would use her illness to get away with selfish or cruel statements about us or loved ones. She had delusions of persecution that emerged when she had these mini episodes, where her generosity and anything she did for us or her friends and family were actually terrible exploitation of her mental illness.

&#x200B;

3. At 5 years old I broke down crying in class and I didn't know why. My teacher asked me if it was something at home and I realized it was because my parents were fighting all the time and i felt helpless and afraid.

&#x200B;

4. At 6 years old I had a fever and refused to take medicine for it. My parents held me down and gave me a suppository. It was a traumatic memory. After that, they would threaten the butt medicine if I balked at taking medicine.

&#x200B;

5.At 6 years old, I remember my mother being so drunk she passed out, and I could not wake her up. I was afraid she was dead, and tried to revive her by pressing ice cubes (gotten with a chair against the refrigerator). She did not stir.

&#x200B;

6.At 7 years old, my room was a mess and my mother was tired of cleaning it. She ordered me to clean it, and not knowing where to start i took all my books off my shelf to organize them. She checked on me and became angry at the increased mess. I went to the library and read a book on parenting that said children are easily overwhelmed and need tasks  one part at a time. She dismissed it.

&#x200B;

7.At 8 years old my mother needed to take my sister and I to the doctor. She became so drunk she could not find the doctors office, we were afraid for our lives at her driving, and she knocked over our trash can parking. My father explained to us that if she was drunk we could not let her drive us anywhere.

&#x200B;

8.At 9 years old my mother came to pick me up from my Aunt's after work, and she was so drunk I stopped my sister from getting into the car and we walked the half-mile home.

&#x200B;

9.At 9 years old, the house was a mess and my mother had an episode. She came into my room at 8am Saturday morning, ripped the blankets from me still asleep, and screamed that the house was filthy and that she was not cleaning it alone. When we asked what to do with the various things on the table (not knowing where they went), she screamed ""You don't know how to clean a table? I'll show you how to clean a table!"" And used her arm to sweep everything off the table onto the floor. She then told us to sweep up and throw away the 'trash' on the floor.

&#x200B;

10. At 9 years old my sister and I started walking the half-mile to school. We dressed before my parents left for work at 7am, and returned home long before they got home around 6pm. They also stopped helping us with our homework, suggesting we use our teachers or classmates. My grades started slipping and I stopped doing many homework assignments. My parents scolded me for being lazy.

&#x200B;

11. At 10 years old my mother cheated on my father with someone she met at AA (mandated by the courts for dui) who told her that her drinking was not a problem. My sister and I knew because we heard my parents fighting about it.

&#x200B;

12. At 10 years old my parents split up and my dad moved out. Sleeping at my mom's boyfriend Frank's house was uncomfortable (strange place, no beds). When my sister would not sleep, Frank threatend to dicipline her if she did not leave him and my mltger alone. When my father found out, in front of us he told my mom if her boyfriend touched us he would kill him.

&#x200B;

13. At 10 years old I developed night terrors and subsequent insomnia. My father told me to think about happy things. About this time I started eating at night, bored and lonely and desperate to feel better. School became miserable, I stopped socializing, and was largely friendless until 13. I gained weight rapidly from this point on, going from husky to obese, which further isolated me.

&#x200B;

14. At 11 years old a classmate and friend told me he often saw my dad at the grocery store and he always had several cases (24 packs) of beer in his car. He asked me if my father had a drinking problem, and I said nothing, not knowing how to say it was my mother.

&#x200B;

15. At 11 years old I remember telling my mother that it seemed like all she cared about was beer and ciggarettes. She told me it seemed all I cared about was eating and drinking. I was fat because I was selfish.

&#x200B;

16. At 10-11 years old I was between bedrooms (renovations) and my mother would listen to music on headphone, drink, and sob uncontrollably. While I tried to sleep.

&#x200B;

17. At 12 years old, my mother asked if I was happy. I told her that everyday I walked to school I considered throwing myself into traffic.

&#x200B;

18. At 12 I was enrolled in counseling for depression. The counciler spoke to me at length, and then to my mother. When the counciler mentioned that there was a concering amount of drug and alcohol abuse in my stories, my mother said it was not an issue and cancelled all future counciling, explaining to me that I was putting myself and my family in jeopardy by telling anyone that.

&#x200B;

19. At 12 years old I fell and fractured my ankle at my sister's birthday party. Because the pain was not extreme, my parents assured me it was just sprained. They did not bring me to the hospital for two weeks, and in that time I regularly limped half a mile to the babysitters house. Each day. The x-ray confirmed a fracture, and I was told if it got any worse it could stunt the growth of that leg. I was in a cast for months.

&#x200B;

20. At 13 years old my father told me that I needed to get my weight under control, because at my weight I would die before him, and it was a parent's worst fear to bury their child. His solution was that I play outside more. I had no control over what food was purchased or cooked and reader, I ate mayonnaise sandwich lunches and cheese and cracker dinners.

&#x200B;

21. At 13 years old I brought home a test where I had gotten a perfect score and an award. My mother asked if I could get perfect scores on tests why couldn't I do my homework more often? I earned dozens of more awards, and threw them in the trash. Every. Single. Time.

&#x200B;

22. At 13 years old my Father promised during the school year that we would spend more time together that Summer playing a game we had played when I was young but not for years (D&D). That Summer he lost his materials and explained that we just could not play. I realized it was not could not, he just had no time for me. He still followed sports and prime-time tv religiously.

&#x200B;

23.  At 13 years old I was called to the office because my clothes stunk, and asked if there was hot water at home. The laundry had been left in the washer too long.

&#x200B;

24. At 13 years old another student asked me why I wore the same shirt three days in a row. I did not know what to say, it was how my parents wore clothes.

&#x200B;

25. The Summer between 12-13 years old the fighting became so bad, and her episodes so hateful and angry, that I started sleeping during the day and being awake at night. This would go on year round for four years, coming home from school, going to sleep immediately, waking up at 10pm, and being awake for the rest of the day. It was like sleepwalking through life, and crushingly lonely. My parents had no comment.

Wow, this is getting longer than I expected. I will post a part II instead.

Reader, I love my parents. They had their own issues and challenges. But please take it seriously if you or someone you know has children and struggles with alcohol, mental illness, or abuse.",12

My bully is disabled now.,"My dad was a gangster back in his day so violence is nothing new for him if he needed to. When I was in middle school, a big kid would mess with me. This guy was a bully and would beat other smaller kids around. One day, when my dad picked me up, he saw the kid pushing me. I didn’t know that he saw it. 

One week later, everyone knew that the kid got attacked by a random guy with a mask. That bully became disabled and was on wheelchair ever since. He stopped bullying others.

In high school, my dad was hanging with his friends at our place having an outdoor BBQ. One of his friends’ kid was bullied and he told his friend how he handled my bully. My aunt asked me to bring meat to the elders (my dad and his friends) and I overheard it. I got so scared.",2241

So. People always want to know ""what's wrong with you, why are you like this"" , my therapists have always tried to get me to open up about ""the event""...my parents never wanted to, my boyfriends CERTAINLY never wanted to. Actually, thats not true, one of them did- it turned him on, we didn't work out. Another bf broke up with me after I told him my story. I've never told another soul since then, though my current therapist is getting pretty damn close to cracking me. 🤷‍♀️ 

I'm 33. When I was 19, I thought I was invincible. See, I sold ecstasy by the hundreds every weekend (only a few dozen a day during the week)  with my then boyfriend. We would usually go together to ""re-up"" at this ""fancy"" 5 star hotel in Dallas. This *ONE TIME* I ended up going alone for, mainly, convenience related reasons. This *ONE TIME* ruined my life...forever. Well, the forever part is yet to be seen...but thus far, at the least. 

So. The drug deal goes smoothly. I mean, as far as drug deals ever go smoothly? Lol Anyways. So I'm [REDACTED_NAME] back to my, well, Jame's car (my then boyfriend). I see ""iceman"" and 2 guys with him I've never met. He's a frequent flier at the Molly club (he buys x often) so I assume James told him to meet me in the parking lot to pick up. Oh man. You know that expression about assume making an ass out of u and me?? Wish I'd have learned that lesson sooner. I digress. 

Iceman starts walking over towards me, so I walk towards an enclosed trash area, you know the ones I mean, those cement rooms for the dumpsters? Yeah my genius and invincible ass walked straight into it, my back against the dumpster, iceman and his 2 friends blocking...life. I get hit by, what felt like a brick. I know now that it was just a fist to the temple but it was enough to knock me unconscious long enough to barely start to come to in the car, start to panic, another brick...the next time I remember opening my eyes and seeing anything, fuck I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Oh guys. Idk if I CAN do this, I want to. God, I need to. But. Fuck. Ok ok ok. So. You know those old cobblestone like, brick type idek how to describe them, the uneven bricks? Well...I was being, dragged, essentially down stairs, and I remember reaching out trying to claw at these damn cobblestone brick walls, trying to get them to stop, trying to break free...then, I remember, I actually think time had to have frozen because I had an entire monologue with myself about how I used to HATE when people in movies did that exact thing...like, duh, nails are NOT strong enough to do anything here to help!!!! Yet here i was clawing at a basement wall that was probably older than my mom...sturdier, by far, than me. Time resumes, and I go back into this fight or flight mode. I start kicking and scratching, twisting and clawing. Digging and ramming. Anything I can think of, anything I can remember from the YEARS of martial arts my biological (aka sperm donor 🙄) father tried to teach me...albeit he tried to teach me self defense by just attacking. Sigh. 

Obviously this is ""the event"" so it doesn't end with me suddenly recalling some magical kung fu, and escaping into the arms of some helpful police officer. 

No. It results in me being chained in a basement for 13 fucking days. Thirteen. THIRTEEN. You know in the movies, when they're screaming, and there is always that one person watching the movie with you that sits there saying why bother screaming, no one will help you. FUCK THAT. I later found out that the trip that was made to ""rescue"" me and arrest my...whatever YOU want to call them...was the SECOND trip made by law enforcement. Which still haunts me, this possibility that- had I just perpetually screamed and hollered for help, it would not have been THIRTEEN FUCKING DAYS. 

Again, I digress. Iceman and his friends not only kidnapped me, but they stole my damn drugs (at the time it really irked me, now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a fucking drug dealer, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that I was irked. Smh) and force fed me pill after pill until honestly, I don't remember everything. Idk if thats me blocking it out because- hello- trauma or if it was some sort of psychosis. Rationally, twas a combination of the two. 

I will not, can not, do a blow by blow, day by day. But the highlights reel? 

I can no longer even hear the slightest tinge of heavy metal or I go into panic mode...I'm [REDACTED_NAME] full blown- palms sweaty, rapid heart rate, blurry vision, hyperventilating, tightened muscles...the whole nine. Its ridiculous. I mean, I never was a huge fan of heavy metal ANYWAYS. but to not even be able to sit thru a movie scene where heavy metal plays in the background has seriously put a damper on movie viewing potentials. Js. The reason for this objection to this music, is because THAT is the one consistent sound I would hear the ENTIRE TIME they were torturing me, aside from their taunting. And it played even when they left. It played day in, day out. Non. Fucking. Stop. 

Obviously there was a ridiculous amount of rape, with objects, without. I'm a feisty fucking psycho, I'll be the first to admit it. So I probably made my ""stay"" a helluva lot more painful than it otherwise would have been, but I couldn't NOT talk shit to them, asking things like ""is it in yet"" knowing full well, agonizingly well, that they were, indeed ""in"" ... trying to bite off anything that was put near my mouth. I don't really follow rules very well to begin with (hello, this recount started out with me as an ecstasy dealer...??) So when they said sit, I tried standing, when they said stand, I'd sprawl, when they said open, I bit...it is what it is. 

Over the course of, idk hours? Days? There were no windows. No sense of time, other than them coming and going. No pun fucking intended. They began bringing in one of those tripods with this dingy little, God, it looked sooo cheap, video recorder. You gotta think, this was 14 years ago, walmart didn't offer as fancy of camcorders as they do now 🤷‍♀️ anyways. The dumb shits. That's actually what saved my life...*indignant hmph* the idiots filmed the things they were doing with me, to me I should say, in that basement...but the kicker?? They started showing the tape off to their friends. Well. That ended with 2 things happening. 1, a new guy wanted an invite, and was granted said invite. And 2, someone they showed it to got a bad feeling it wasn't just ""a prank"" like iceman and the others were saying, and he reported it to the police. ❤ That man, (crying again), literally saved my life...and I'll never get to thank him...I'll never know his name...he was excluded from everything I was told. Everything I got to read. From everything. I guess I know it was for his protection, but I wish I could send him brownies or something fuck idk. What do you send to someone that saves your life, unwittingly? 

Digression...again...sorry, I ramble. Idek where to pick back up. So ok. Uhm. There are now 4 guys, and still over a hundred ecstasy pills left, and they decide that ""simple rape ain't gonna cut this shit no more mayne"" iceman's exact words...so they up the ante...now they're doing things like throwing chains over the rafters of the ceiling to wrap around my feet to dangle me in a bucket of DIRTY smelly, putrid ass water with fucking FISH IN IT. (Sidebar-this is the REAL reason I hate seafood, for anyone that ever pestered me about it and got a lame answer in return). I have no clue what kind of fish they were, but I can only assume the soul sucking kind...cuz thats what they did. They ate my soul. They'd suspend me long enough that I could almost stop hearing the heavy metal playing. Have you ever gotten a headrush soooo bad that your hearing diminishes? Its kind of a cool feeling, when not related to the trauma surrounding it...hey, any escape at that point...the fish would be bumping into my face, my hair and them swimming together, my vision would blur, the bubbles escaping my lips would start to dwindle then I'd wake up chained back on the bed, or to a chair for...something else. 

At night, or at least what I called night, when I was finally alone, when I knew it was over for the time being. I would just lie there wherever they'd left me, and cry. Or wish I could cry...sometimes I had no feelings at all, thats when I would get the most scared. When I realized I didn't feel...anything. no fear, no pain, no panic or terror, no regrets, no fucking anything. I hated that feeling so much. Sometimes I would call out, I can admit-now- that yes, sometimes in those dead soul moments, I would call out for iceman, a long time ""friend"" and antagonize him...anything to TRY to get him or anyone to come back down to the basement so I could feel something...anyfuckingthing!!!! 

In the other moments of solitude. I was enraptured by thoughts of my son, who was spending summer with his grandma and grandpa (I wouldn't have been dealing drugs had he been with me!!!), I was deafened by my fears of what he would think- would he think I left him, that I abandoned him?? What would my mommy think? That I ran off with some boy, chose him over my own child?? Surely they both knew I'd NEVER...but how could they? Here i was, there they were. No one the wiser. Who knew what my boyfriend was doing or thinking. He was probably high as a kite unaware I wasn't home. Then...I would start to wonder why? What happened in these ""men's"" lives to make them like this? What pain had they endured? What loneliness? Emptiness? Abuse? I stopped being angry with them. I forgave them, before I had even been rescued. It was, and still is, the strangest feeling to not HATE these men. To not detest and deplore these disgusting, pitiful creatures. Instead I pitied them, I felt pain- for them. I cried for them, for what their lives must have been like, to have become these creatures. 

Yet still, I did not ever comply with their orders. 

On the day, and I can say with absolute certainty that it was daytime, that law enforcement finally got what they needed to forcibly enter to arrest and rescue...I was passed out, it was an exhausted- hadn't eaten, barely drank, been raped and tortured for 13 days with x being fed to me every few hours- kind of passed out. The dead asleep, completely unaware of your surroundings sleep. I awoke to a man standing over me and chains rattling, falling to the floor. I kicked him. I thought he was another new guy there to hurt me, to use me, to ""play"" i kicked him and, realized my chains were off of me, and I tried, please believe me when I say I TRIED to stand up and run...but I couldn't. I couldn't stand, I was too weak, and that made me sooo angry. I was seeing red. That is the ONLY time I've ever understood that expression. So I yelled and I spit and I thrashed as best as I could...and then this, angel...this woman, with a tight bun...she had just, these two loose bits of hair by her ear that caught my eye, and I just stared for what felt like hours at this beautiful woman and her shiny hair...and she wrapped a blanket around me (to restrain me, but hey lol) and leaned in to rest her head on my broken face, and I saw her tears!!!! I saw her crying and I was so confused, and scared. I didn't know who she was or why she was there. I remember I kept bouncing between confusion and admiration. I realize how ridiculous and stupid it sounds for me to say I was mesmerized by those locks of hair loose from her bun, how shiny they were...but I was. It was a beauty when I'd seen nothing but agony for almost 2 weeks. She let her tears fall and that made me so mad. That made me so fucking forcefully angry I snarled. I literally, like a comic book villain, snarled. Thats when I heard the commotion upstairs, thats when badges came into sight, that's when her words that she had been saying to me started to become clear...""I got you baby girl. Its all over. You're safe. We got them, you're safe. Hussshhhhh...you're safe"" (and here are more tears. Fun) I remember simultaneously collapsing into her arms, and worrying whether she would be able to support my weight. Looking back, prior to the whole 13 day fiasco, I only weighed about 118 pounds, by the end of it, at the ER I was down to 98 pounds, so yeah...she could support my weight. SMH. 

I let her carry me upstairs, heart racing as I looked around at all the cars and officers and cameras and people just fucking, so many people....but not the right people. I started screaming at this...angel. at my angel. ""No, you're wrong, that isn't all of them!!! You're missing one. Let me go. I have to go!!! You didn't protect me, no one can protect me. You fucking idiot!!!"" I twisted and shifted till I was (barely) on my feet and I spat in this poor woman's face and called her a ""fucking incompetent worthless bag of bones"" and she still had this amazing fucking hair, it was so annoying (at the time, obviously my priorities have since shifted). 

You see, only 3 of my abusers were present. Once my angel had realized what I was accosting her for, she reached back out, repositioned the (restraint) blanket, and reassured me that the other guy had been picked up at work. 

Long story, well...still super long but jumping ahead a few chapters. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] super screwed up from that whole thing, uhm, 1 guy DID end up escaping. Got out on bail, then went ahead and took off. Another 1 got out for good behavior the month before I decided to get my concealed carry permit. Iceman got out last year and the guy that asked for the invite got out last month...",9

Hi im a 24M soon to be 25. I just wanted to write this so maybe i wouldn't feel so alone going through this and maybe if you went through something similar, them i hope i make you feel less lonely too. I hope you can understand.

1 year and half ago. I was dating this girl, lets call her R. She was my first girlfriend when i was young and we had a very long story together.

When i was 14 or so, she moved to another city and that was the last i time i saw her in a while. Time passed. I was in college, it was just before COVID happened. I posted a picture of my first ever tattoo on Instagram. She saw the post and we started talking again.

It felt really great to talk to her again after so many years. Even though we were so toung when we dated, the way she treated me so well and made me feel good back them created a sparkle that never really ended.

We would have great talks everyday. She would send me ""Good morning"" ""Did you sleep well?"" messages every morning. I felt so good. I felt so cared for. This warm feeling that i was feeling again. We were just friends now, but i would always feel butterflies when i was talking to her. We would have fun every day. We would tell jokes, make each other laugh. We would talk until morning and sleep late. even though we had to work the other day. We wouldn't care. we were having fun.

This going back to talking to her happened durin the pandemic. I wasn't leaving my house and wasn't either. Her father had a health problem so they had to be extra careful.

She was dating a guy at the time. But because of the pandemic they weren't seeing each other and god knows how hard that can be to any one. Anyway, what started as just two old friends talking began to slowly trabsform itself into something else. We slowly started talking about our feeling and our past together, remembering the good old days.

One night while i was talking to her, she sent me an voice message saying she and her boyfriend had argued. She sad that he would never hang out with her after work and would always sleep when watching movies online with her. She said to him that he should be more like me.

(Poor guy. I didn't know them, but soon enough i would be feeling just as bad as him.)

At the time i felt weird at first. I mean What we're you doung R? I kinda felt bad for the guy, but i couldn't control not being happy with that. My heart went 200bpm i was falling in love with her and apparently so was her.

Their relationship went downhill fast after that. And ours was rising to a new level.

I have to make a quick detour from the story, just to show to you what was going on inside of me. I was feeling happy, the happiest i had ever been, but i couldn't see her because of the pandemic. I suffer from anxiety and at the time i didn't go to therapy - Something that would change after this - and so i didn't have the tools to cope with this situation. When i realized i could have a relationship with her again, it felt like a switch had turned on inside of me. There was this feeling inside of me that was something like this: ""She's starting to like me. I just need to not screw it up"". This detour is important, you'll see why.

Going back to the story. We started talking more and more. She would talk less to him everyday. It felt SO GOOD to have her attention just for me. I cant put into words the great feeling i was feeling. She would care for me, she would ssk how i was, we would always send each other ""good morning"" and ""good night"". We would have fun every day. This moment i call the summit.

After a couple of months of this. I dont remember very well how it happened - My Brain kinda deleted some of the memories of this, so its hard for me to recollect everything - but she said that they weren't just a couple she was engaged to him. When she said that, my heart broke - the first, but not the last. Was I hoping for something impossible? Was she playing with me? Nah, that couldn't be, she would never hurt me like that. Or so i thought.

""It's ok"" -I thought. ""If just continue to do what im doing i know things will go right for me"". I wasn't trying to end their relationship at the start, it just evolved slowly and it was an effort of us both so it was just natural.

 Anyway, one day she sent me a voice message crying her eyes out. She and her boyfriend fought and apparently that was it. I knew something had happened, because we didn't talk on the previous couple of days. I tried to console her as much as i could, she was so sad. And them, things got spicy. In the middle of our mutual sadness, the feelings we were starting to feel again for each other. We declared our love for each other. She said that she still loved me, so much. I told her i loved her very much. My heart almost exploded. I swear to god i could swing an entire ocean just to see her, but i couldn't leave the house. That night i slept like a loved man.

We continued to talk. But now we were more than friends. Our conversations would go beyond of the daily things to S3x stuff. Haha it felt great. Things definitely got 🔥

This all happened on the first or so year of the pandemic. But on the start of the second years, my heaven would cease to exist. This moment i call the start of the fall.

One day she sent me a voice message that her now ex sent her a message saying that he was very sorry for everything that happened and all tha jazz. She started crying saying that she was feeling so divided between us both. On one hand she said, she was loving me now and that I had in a couple of months made her feel like no one else ever did. But she had a story with this guy too.

I could feel sorry for her. I mean it's not an easy thing. but my therapist said that i should never feel sorry for what she's about to do. So im sorry to you reader, but im not going to feel sorry for her.

Try to understand my POV. We started as stranger / old friends and things naturally turned into a real, even though not physical, relationship. I didn't start this, feeling i would end up with her. I was just having a great time with her. But now things were different. She said to me she had broken up with the guy after and that for me we were gf/bf it was just a matter of the pandemic ending for me to see her. But now, she said she was in doubt between me and her ex. Im sorry but that's just cruel and unfair. I would never do that to someone. If I end a relationship and start a new one, that's it, im committed to this new person. I mean come on that's the least you can do to respect someone you started dating. You dont just simply makes that person fall in love with you, or say to that person you are dating them and them come out the blue and say you're in doubt between you and their ex. Playing with someone's feelings like that is super low level, please reader never do that to someone, dont make another me in this world.

After she told me she was in doubt my anxiety went through the roof. I felt like it was my responsibility to save this relationship. I started going crazy thinking about what i should do everyday in order to maintain her. I felt like i wasn't doing enough. I didn't know but i had to be doing something wrong, otherwise she wouldn't have doubts. And so everydat i would have anxiety attacks in the morning, in the night, at work. Every time i couldn't check my phone i felt guilty and angry at myself, because if i didn't give her enough attention, she would leave just like she left her ex. So i would constantly check my phone, i Would stop everything to text here. She became my first priority. I loved her so much. Since we were young. I was not going to lose her. I wouldn't screw up another relationship, no, not this time. This time i would put 200% effort on this. ""No. I won't let you screw this up again and lose the girl of your dreams"" - I said to myself.

A few weeks went by. And all this months i would constant, daily anxiety/panic attacks of the fear of losing her. And them the day came. I didn't know at the time, but this would change everything for me.

She called me one day and said she gave it a thought and she was going back to her ex. After that phrase it looked like the world had frozen. Time froze. Have you ever felt like this before? I felt like i left my body. I was hearing, but i wasn't there. I was in shock.

After she hang up. I started crying. I swear to god i never cried more in my entire life. I let every anxious thought out. It felt like i was a dying star becoming a black hole. The sadness was beyond what i can write in here. This moment i call the downfall into madness.

I didn't know at the time but it had a name, what i was going through. It's called depression.

I never had any problems before this with depressive thoughts, but now i wasn't eating, wasn't showering, wasn't going to work. I lost about 20 Kg in 3 months and through all this i was feeling mad and i mean mad, but i wasn't feeling mad at her, i was feeling mad at me. I was my fault. I didn't do enough."" Congratulations loser, you did it again. Lost the girl of your dreams, because you didn't do enough, because no matter how much you try YOU ARE NOT ENOUGH!"" - the voice shouted inside my head.

She knew what she had done to me, because i told her. She knew it, but even so, she continued talking to me everyday as if nothing had happened.

As if this all wasn't hard and unfair enough to any humans being, what happened next was worse. She started, for some reason, to play with me. She made me think that we were was still together, that still had a chance and then she would break that again saying that she was with her ex. This cycle continued for months. I would gain hope and lose again. Feel loved and them feel rejected. Truly, I didn't know anymore what to feel. I felt empty. Shallow.

I felt so ashamed of what was going on. Feeling like was being manipulated, played with. I was super sad too. My therapist said that i was in a abusive relationship and everything that felt was right to feel. The thing about being in a abusive relationship is that you dont know you are in one. The abuser makes you think the fault was yours, but at the same time they make them want you, and so you become dependent on them. They hurt you, but you kove them, so you continue with it. I can say that being a Man, when it comes to feelings it's not a pleasant thing. I told my closest friend what happened, and he didn't take it seriously, that made me worse. I was already feeling ashamed but now i wss feeling even more ashamed. And them i started doing what every human being would if they didn't had anyone to talk too. I started drinking and i mean heavy drinking, everyday. I was so tited of having constant panic attacks and being sad that i started hurting myself. I would drink and scratch my arm to point of bleeding. I couldn't process what happened, how did my heaven suddenly became my hell. How did i lose my dream girl?

She changed after that. She wasn't treating me nice anymore, she would make me feel guilty for not starting conversations. I didn't want to talk to her, but i loved her so i would feel guilty for not talking and i would start talking to her again. She would make feel bad, for saying something, for doing something, for not doing something. Where was my angel? Where was that girl that treated me so well? What had i done to deserve this?

One day. We were talking and she suddenly got mad for a small thing. We were just having a conversation and she started saying bad things about me and all of sudden, she blocked me. in every social media. She never talked to me again after that. that was the last time. When you lose someone you care for so much all of sudden, even if they didn't die, it feels like grief. I was depressed enough but she had to that, she had to make things worse.

A few months went by...

A friend of mine invited me to her party. I met a friend of hers there. We hang out and slept together. It felt good being loved again after everything that had happened. We stayed together for an entire weekend in her house. God it felt good. Hse seemed nice. intelligent, she was pretty and i definitely attracted to her. The thing about the universe is that it has a ""funny"" way of teaching you lessons. I wanted to hang out with more on the next week, but said she was going back to her hometown for an entire month. When she said that. i swear to you. i had a crazy flash back of everything that happened. being in message only distance relationship again. feeling impotent of sharing physical love. My heart started beating faster with anxiety. but as far as i knew she wasn't R, she wouldn't hurt me and still had an entire day with her. Sunday was over. I left her and went back home.

We continued to talk over whatsapp for the next days. She was so nice. She would tell me jokes. Make me laugh. It felt good. But... it all changed.

She suddenly stopped talking to me. It felt weird, maybe i did something wrong?? I was ok with making a mistake and correcting myself, the problem i had no idea what I did wrong.

If you didn't realize yet. What's about to happened is a small version of what happened to the last girl R.

I couldn't believe it was happening again. Really?? Again?? Distance relationship. Feeling like i wasn't doing enough. Having anxiety. She stopped showing interest in me. I talked to my friend about her, the friend that introduced me to her. She said that she as probably seeing ohter guys. That wasn't i thought i had until my friend to me that. My anxiety worse to new time high. I felt hurt again, just after going through an abusive relationship i was feeling like i was heading for another. My drinking got worse. 

Eventually she came back to town after that month. I tried to invite her to do anything: dinner, going for a walk in the park,... but she would always decline. I had acquired the bad habit of checking her posts in Instagram when she went to her town. I wanted to know what she's wad doing. and if she was seeing other guys. I must admit i let my anxiety take the best of me this time. After all we just had stayed together for a couple of days, but come on, how many time do you have to sleep with someone to start a relationship? 1? 3? 100??

After the last time i invited her. My friend told me she had created a friend's only group in Instagram and i wasn't invited. And she was posting a picture wiht another guy.

The moment she told me that i broke. It happened again. trusted someone that didn't even had the  decency of treating me like a human being. I finally had had enough. i didn't want to feel hyrt and sad again. So i ordered a vodka bottle. I wanted to feel numb. I remember this moment. it was 15:34 of a Wednesday I Remember that well because it was the last thing i saw before blacking out

Woke up the next morning in the hospital. Apparently my parents found almost dead in my own vomit after drinking an entire vodka bottle alone

The look on the doctor was of surprise. Apparently i died for a couple of seconds but they made my heart start again. Only two thoughts came to my head: 
1 - I was feeling sorry and sad that my parents had seen me like that
2 - ""I am [REDACTED_NAME]. Im fine"" - this thought came to me the second my eyes opened i the hospital. it since became my moto.

Left the hospital. Started going to therapy after that. this last part happened beginning of this year. I have improved a lot since, but still i have a long way ahead of me. but im way better now. started being more gentle with me. Started going to the gym. Above all, started being happy with only myself. Im moving out of my parents house for the first and feeling great for I've achieved so far. I had great friens that helped me alog the way too and im greatful for having them. I call this moment Dawn.

I've started liking a girl now, but this time I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. im taking it really slow. Im not 100% over everything that happened. When i realized i was beginning to have feelings for this new girl i had a full blown panic attack at my work. It's still hard for me to trust someone. This girl seems nice. we work together and we have a lot in common. not creating expectations though, just enjoying the now. Whatever has to happen, will happen. It is what it is as they say.

I want to apologize for the giant text i wrote hahaa. But more than just taking this out of my chest. want to say to you, whatever gender you are whatever you sex orientation is, whatever your age is, that if you went through something similar, that you are not alone. Dont do what i did, dont destroy/punish yourself for someone who doesn't deserve you. Be kind to yourself, be patient too. Remember that there's always someone there for you, to help you, to talk you. There's no shame in needing help. Dont feel bad for being in an abusive relationship, do yourself a favor and leave that relationship, you deserve better. and remember that there's always going a be a light a the end of the tunnel. It's when its darkest that we shine the brightest and if the worse comes to happen, remember: Some Storms comes to clean our path.

I hope everything goes well for us now.",2

vel91r,1655486704.0,2022-06-17 17:25:04,offmychest,A story about my late Dad has affected me more than I thought it would (Long Post),"I just need someone to tell about this because I don't know how to feel. A little bit of background: I (23 F) lost my dad to bone cancer on February 2021. He was the most loving, caring, and considerate father I could have asked for. Watching him fight 7 months against this extremely painful cancer was very traumatizing for me. I am [REDACTED_NAME] oldest of two. My little brother is 15. I still have anxiety and have hypochondriac tendencies that I am [REDACTED_NAME] to therapy for. 

Okay, onto the story. The other day I went to visit my mom at her house. After a few glasses of wine, my dad came to conversation. While my dad was an amazing father, he was not the best husband. He was a functioning alcoholic, and because he was such a great dad, I didn't realize how bad it was until I was an adult. But my mom has forgiven him and helped me take care of him in his last months. 

I decided to ask her if she knew WHY my dad was like this all his life. He never wanted to amount to anything. He stayed at a dead end job that paid very little. He was an AMAZING singer, and when a producer family member tried to push him to audition for ""The voice"", my dad declined. All my life I grew up seeing how talented he was in singing and even baseball, but he never pursued his talents. And one thing I noticed too since I can remember...he HATED my grandma.

After asking my mom, told me the following:

When my dad was 16, he lived in an abusive home. My grandma and grandpa were toxic, and my dad being the oldest, would get the worst of it. So he often looked for ways to stay out of his house. Instead of joining a gang or finding the wrong crowd, my dad found baseball. He would play with local leagues who would not charge him for his uniform or the membership to be in the league because he was **SO FREAKING GOOD** at playing. They wanted him to be in the team, even if it meant for free since he had no money at the time. One day, there was news that talent scouts were coming to town in a few months to check out and find people to sign to the MLB. And the coaches in my dad's team told him he had a real shot. But he needed to train harder and take his body to its peak athleticism. This meant buying high quality foods, vitamins, and he had to actually sign up to the league with a paid membership to even be considered. This was all very expensive, and my dad had no support from his family to help him pay. So, my dad started to take the money my grandma was giving him to pay his school tuition and instead stopped going to school and would train for 8 hours a day. He used the money to buy the food, the multivitamins, and pay his membership with the league. Two months later, the scouts come to town, and they are floored my dad's talent. They offered him a Minor league contact and let him know that once he turned 18 he would be offered a Major League contact. This was it, this was my dad's way out. The hard work and dedication my dad put in for so long, pushed his body so hard, it was all for this moment. My dad had his life laid out in front of him, and it looked VERY promising. The only thing left was for one of his parents to sign the contract, since he was a minor, and then the start of his new life would begin. That day, my dad came home, and my grandma had JUST arrived home too, **from his school**. She found out that he had not paid the tuition for the last 2 months, and that my dad had been skipping school as well. My grandma was LIVID. My dad apologized and begged for her to listen. He explained that he did it for a reason, and that he now had accomplished this amazing thing. But my grandma was having non of it, and of course, refused to sign the contract. **My dad went to my grandpa for help, begged for his support, but my grandpa said no***.* Because he did not want to deal with my grandma's wrath. In the end, even the talent scouts came to his house to try to convince my grandma, to no avail. And just like that, my dad's dream was taken away. From that moment on, my dad became what he eventually became. He started drinking, partying, and god knows what else. Almost like a vendetta against my grandma, he made her life a living hell.

Why does this story affect me so much? Because this was the final piece of a puzzle I had with my dad. Thinking all my life that my dad just didn't have ambition..to finding out he had given up on himself because of this trauma. But I think what affects me the most is that...**this story repeated itself with me**. 

When I was 17 and graduated college, I wanted to leave my house and move to LA with my boyfriend who was 20. I wanted to go to college in LA and start a life away from my hometown. I was accepted at UCLA, my boyfriend was able to take me in, and his family even had a job lined up for me, so I could go to school and work. I planned everything to the T. But when I told my mom about it, she was NOT having it. She said I was crazy for wanting to do this, that is was sin, and that I was not old enough to move out. And I was devastated. Because I was a minor, she was not going to allow me to go. Then my dad stepped in. From the get go he said yes. He liked my boyfriend and trusted my instincts. He even offer to do the [REDACTED_ADDRESS] to LA with all my stuff so I could move in. In that moment I didn't understand just how important this situation was for my dad. In his story, his own dad didn't support him. In my story, he was the dad, and he chose to do what his dad didn't do in that moment. In the end, my mom accepted the situation. I moved in with my boyfriend and I made a good life of myself in LA. When my dad was diagnosed with cancer, I moved back to my hometown to take care of him, and my boyfriend moved as well. He helped me take care of my dad and gave me the moral support I needed in such a horrible situation. My now fiancé and I are a power couple, we have moved back to this town and have made it work. We have a home, are planning a wedding, and are going to start a family in a few years. All thanks to that small decision my father made to let me do what I felt I needed for me. I feel sad for my dad's story, and also very thankful for his unconditional support and love he had for me.",1

At this point we are honestly roommates, we probably see each other for an hour a day. We work different times and basically live our own lives, I pay board and help out with bills. We get on well (one of the reasons I haven't moved out), I've had a lot of health issues over the years and don't have a lot of money saved, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] getting there. Also as everyone knows, the housing market exploded, a cheap house I was looking at last year sold for more than $200k over the listed price.

Today I was at work and another worker (M60) asked if I owned or rented. I told him I was living with my mum and he looked disgusted. 

""What?! What do you mean you still live at home?"" I tried to change the subject but he wouldn't let it go. Said it was ridiculous I still lived at home and should move out, that he owned his house at my age.

It never really bothered me before, of course I'd love to move out but I've never been shamed before. It hurt",2089
13vpue1,1685452028.0,2023-05-30 13:07:08,offmychest,Escorting made me realize we're all peasants,"I was over at some relatives' place yesterday, and these are white collar doctor and professional types who make like 150k-350k a year with master's degree and living in $1M+ homes. They ride my ass, as usual, telling me what to do with my life like get a ""respectable"" white collar office job, find a ""respectable"" white collar husband with a college degree, have a ""respectable"" haircut above my shoulders. I often felt judged for not making as much money or being as ""educated"". The most I ever made in my life was like 50k/year. I was washing the dishes for my aunt because she has hand arthritis from overworking them all these years (somehow they won't hire a maid), and I hear them talking about how expensive hotels are at $150/night. And in the back of my head I thought about the $500/night hotels that my clients stayed in while in town for business or pleasure, and who gave me couple hundred dollars in tips ""just because"". Or how someone spent $3500 on a date with me, and suggested I can get room service on his dime. Or how someone flew over to my city and was going to book a hotel where the cheapest room was $800/night just to see me, and then gave me the full $800 appointment fee for the inconvenience after cancelling our appointment on his end (so I never even met him). As a prostitute I've met men who have met the president, or who were personal friends of CEOs, politicians, and celebrities (or were themselves). If it wasn't for my escorting, I would never have come across men like this, nor seen their lifestyles. I would continued imagining that masters-degree holding workers making 150k/year with heavy student loans were ""rich"" and ""elite"". I am [REDACTED_NAME] particularly a head-turner either, and even my own clients aren't elite-elite, I have barely even scratched the surface of what real wealth is.

These doctors and white collar types think they're high ballers for making 200k a year and act all hoity toity though they wouldn't be able to maintain their lifestyles if they stopped working for their employer for even six months. They think they're better than the citizens who make 50k a year or 30k a year. No you dumb fucks, you're still peasants. We're all peasants who are fighting amongst each other and dragging each other down while there's a whole world out there of people who can spend 50k like it's a price of gum. People who can stay in $800/night hotels for months on end, spend $1000 on a dinner for two like it's going out to McDonalds, to them walking around in a public department store like Neiman Marcus or Saks is like walking around at a Dollar Tree or Goodwill.

To these whales, professional class workers like doctors and lawyers in their BMWs and McMansions are ""hood rich"", meaning they're not that impressive, they're only impressive to other peasants.

I don't look up at the white collar, master's degree-holding professionals as ""rich people"" or resent them (except their snobbery depending on the person). They're not really rich, they're peasants just like the rest of us. To look at doctors and lawyers as ""balling"" would be like when working class whites think native americans are balling and resent them because the latter is getting meager government benefits, or when tenants resent their landlords who mortgaged their 100k homes and view the latter as ""the bourgeois ownership class"" and imagine dragging them down Marxist style whenever the landlord asks for their monthly $300 rent, all the while ignoring the actual rich people out there influencing their lives from a distance.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] that special either. I only crossed path with the rich... all because some random rich guy decided that I, some random non-rich girl, was what he needed to get his dick wet that night. I was so nervous to see them and realized many were just as nervous to see me. And that despite their wealth they're still human and that nobody has it all. Nobody.",2602

I always felt misunderstood I always felt like someone they didn’t in my family. At a young age I Was taken advantage of by someone I don’t fully remember all the details Of who it was when exactly it was because I blocked it out. As I got older I would act out a-lot with my family when things didn’t go my way. And it led to disciplinary action both at home and at school. I remember that I spent a-lot of time at my moms parents home. They took care of me so much. With them I always felt supported no matter what I did that was bad. As I got older and progressed into middle school and high school I struggled to make friends and I struggled to have a good social life. I had a few really good friends but I was in an outside crowd. I was struggling in school and trying to fit in With groups that would never accept me,  I felt like an outcast. I decided to join the Navy out of high school to try and prove my manhood to my family and try and show them I wasn’t a failure. At this time I was in a relationship with my high school sweetheart  Who I had planned to marry some day. She was my world but when I went to the military we eventually started to have some issues not seeing each other was so difficult. And then I went on a detachment to California. When I was there I was trying to fit in with my fellow military members and we started playing a drinking game. At the time I was under age but they accepted me in and I did whatever to try and have friends this game quickly deteriorated into something it shouldn’t have. It turned into a game where they would dare me and a female to do things. 

From what I remember it got to a point we where laying on top of each other in just our underwear it was not appropriate at all and I stopped it even with the fear of being kicked out of the group but I had a girlfriend and It brought back memories of my childhood trauma. After this my relationship ended because I felt so guilty for what had happened. After this I was having an extremely hard time feeling safe with the people I served next to. I wanted out I couldn’t take the pain of what had happened. I couldn’t handle how I felt after all of this. I got medically separated from the military and I felt like an absolute failure. I felt like I let my family down, I felt like I proved everyone right that I was nothing but a screw up. I moved back to Ohio and things went from bad to worse all of that failure and pain from the military led to my brother and I having a falling out and led To some things happening that ultimately landed me in jail for a few weekends. In this time frame  was going through the court stuff I met a girl in my hometown who I had known from high school and we started dating. We ended up having a child together. Our relationship started out well but it deteriorated. When we found out about the baby we saw it as a sign and we stuck together trying to make it work. My daughters mom. Pushed me to get into therapy and I tried it and quit it wasn’t what I thought I needed. I thought I was fine and had nothing wrong so I quit going. When my daughter was just over 2 years old her mom left me because I was a mess I wasn’t treating her right the feelings from My past failed relationship crept in reminding me of my traumas and my failures. After we split up I went off the deep end, ultimately leading to me Going to therapy because I realized I needed it if I wanted to have a relationship with my daughter. 

Therapy saved my life helped me to work through the pain and the feeling of failure and feeling of everything being my fault. In 2022 I met the most amazing woman who I felt a connection with instantly. We never started talking in a relationship major until 2023 because she was in a relationship when I met her. Things kicked off and we had an amazing connection But ultimately I got cold feet I was worried about my past trauma because I didn’t want to hurt her because she was the Most amazing woman I Have ever met. Me getting cold feet did hurt her unfortunately but we reconnected again in 2024 and ultimately started dating. It was the greatest relationship I have ever had at first. We had a strong connection we wanted the same things. The first time we had a fight it terrified me it reminded me of the failures and trauma again. And I shut down I didn’t talk to her about it and it ruined the relationship. We broke up, after breaking up we got back together on and off but only for a few weeks because I was so bad I was angry at myself and took that anger out on her. All of this trauma led to me losing who I believe is my person. The person that I should be spending my life with and building a family because I Got out of therapy and Never got back into it until it was too late. Now this amazing woman who is the love of my life is with someone else and I hope she is happy but I can’t be happy when the love of my life is gone because of my trauma and the way that I treated her When it set it.  This trauma effects my ability to cope with loss. ",1
1jngfh5,1743352606.0,2025-03-30 16:36:46,TrueOffMyChest,My stepfather was arrested for false accusations of DV and SA by my mentally ill mother when I was 14 then acquitted of all charges. Should I write him a letter?,"Hi Reddit.
 
I’ve decided there is no better place to tell this crazy story and ask for advice for the question that’s been eating me alive for years.
 
Sit tight, as this one is  long and a definite mind fuck.
 
For context, I (31F) have 3 siblings on my mother’s side. We all have different fathers. I have a now 34 year old sister, and a 21 year old brother.
My mother struggled for years  with severe mental health issues, ptsd from her own childhood, as well as schizophrenia developed later in life during my early childhood, as well as Munchhausen (yes, like gypsy roses mother), but that’s for a different part of the story..
 
My  mother was a teen mom to me and my sister. Had two kids before she turned 18. She was promiscuous, dated many men, partied and did not always prioritize her kids.
 
When I turned about 4, my mother started dating a guy she knew during her teen years, and quickly moved us 3 hours away to the town where he was living for his  teaching job. After moving in with him, he basically took initiative and always made sure my mother, sister and I had everything we needed and wanted. We didn’t live luxurious but we always had a roof over our head, food on the table and clothes on our back.
He was a nice guy. More unique then most- He was goth,but with a super professional kick . Loved exotic animals and bugs, had tarantulas and frogs and fish, loved books and deep conversations. He was a poetic type, very unique but also very gentle at heart. Not big on his feelings but you could tell he tried. He was a quantum physics teacher if I remember correctly, had a math major and was a kick ass college professor. He was brilliant but mysterious. People were either drawn to him, or afraid of him based on his look. It always kept life interesting.
My mother’s mental health slowly deteriorated over the next few years, but she was still mostly functional. She slept all day was the biggest thing didn’t work and received SSI.
When I was around 9, my mother got pregnant with his first child. She got everything she wanted and needed and more for my soon to be brother, and my step dad worked overtime to make sure he met every desire of my mother and his soon to arrive son.
 
After my brother (we will call him B) was born, my mothers mental health rapidly deteriorated.
 
It seems like every other day she was getting in a huge, unprovoked fights with my stepfather. There were times that he would stay at his office at the college because of how out-of-control my mother was. My sister at the time was 13, and many nights she would cook for me or we would cook together because my mother would either be sleeping or deep in a depressive state and not coming out of her room until the wee hours of the night.
 
My sister and I both often were the ones taking care of my brother, as all she did was sleep all day and nursed him off and on and otherwise he was out in the main living area with me. I missed over 200 days of school a few years in a row, fearing leaving my brother at home with nobody, while my step father worked and my mother slept.
 
It was not all peaches and cream with my stepfather, he did have a temper, and the sense of we would definitely clash over things like chores and dishes, but now that I’m older, I realize that he just had such a heavy load and dealing with a person like my mother would put a toll on anybody, I honestly don’t know how he dealt with it for so long and didn’t actually snap. The mental anguish she put him and all of us through was literal hell.
 
As I hit my teen years, I would leave for long periods of time with friends. Many of my friends parents realized the dysfunction of our household and my mother and would let me have “extended weeks long sleepovers” I assume as a way to help me.
 
Around age 13/14, was the peak of the  crisis. Anytime my sister and I would leave, my mother would call the police saying we were “mentally ill” or “manic”
She would often call the cops on him, even when nothing was going on. Looking back I wonder if it was episodes of paranoia or manic for her. She would create these stories and scenarios in her head of my sister and I having a variety of health issues or mental health issues, as well as others around her.
She benefited financially from these stories that she created. Both from herself and from us.
 
A few weeks after my birthday, I remember being outside with my friend just up the road from my house. I watched as a cop car drove by, with my step dad in the back seat- he waived, and I could see the fear and sadness in his eyes. I didn’t even know what had happened, but I knew that was the start of something horrible.
That was the last time I saw him.
She had accused him of dv, but according to my sister who was there, nothing happened. But my sister was so checked out of reality at that point, trying to escape my mothers mental illness with her own life and boyfriend, she just kept quiet.
 
Over the next year or more - life went to complete shit. My mother could not afford the bills because she only got ssi. She never let my stepdad come and get any of his exotic animals after that incident even with a civil assist, and they all died and rotted in our basement as we collected what we could and went into multiple domestic violence shelters. She milked the situation and got financial kelp from various neighbors, friends and relatives,.
 
With each shelter, came a more distorted version of the story. More things were added, that were not true and the more I rebelled because I knew that she just ruined our life over her own unhappiness with her relationship and mental illness being out of control.
My mother was so fucking brilliant and so beautiful, which made her mental illness so dangerous. So many people believed her story, although I could see directly through it and so could every one in our family. Slowly, but surely People cut us off in our family and I had no lifeline. I just had to standby while she had this distorted story that she told people, wall, ranking in the benefits and moving us all over the state.. Eventually, she convinced enough therapist and staff at the various shelters we lived at to help her add more charges. She made accusations against him that he was molesting my brother, and me. At this point, I couldn’t stand by and watch her do it anymore so I started to talk to anyone that would listen. People at my school peopl, at the shelter. I would tell them the TRUTH how it was all crazy and she was making it up. And at that point is when her  Munchhausen kicked in at full force.
 
She would tell people that I had PTSD, that I had bipolar schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, you name it, I had it. . When one doctor wouldn’t listen or would ask for records she would move us somewhere else. The story of gypsy Rose? It made me so relieved to hear of someone else going through it  when it all came out because that was literally my story, minus the cancer.
She put me on more medication than I could even handle. I was zombied out couldn’t think and it took me 30 to 60 seconds to respond to people when they would speak to me because I was on such heavy sedative medication and medication intended for adults with severe mental health issues, not small teenagers.. She would tell people that I saw things and then I heard voices and I didn’t. And they would just listen to her because she was so charming.
 
A few people saw through it, a therapist who came to our home regularly and a few people at my school. They reported her and Cps eventually got involved, and this was right around the time of the trial against my stepdad for all of these “alleged” charges  that she said he did. So of course she tried to smooth her way into the social workers heart saying that we were all victims and we were all so damaged from the abuse that we endured. She had the social worker convinced for the most part, but the social worker still kept an eye on us.
 
I remember there was a time that my brother got out of the house when I was at school because she was sleeping in the middle of the afternoon, and he was wandering around a busy road And she tried to say that it was my fault because I had just got home when they were bringing my brother back. Cps  kept our case open after that point
 
My life was constantly a battle of fighting against somebody who was so convincing and so charming with one of the most dangerous mental health issues imaginable , trying to convince others that I was sane of right mind, all while trying to make sure my brother didn’t grow up with the same bullshit attached to his name. It was a losing battle. I was drowning.
My sister felt pregnant as a teen and eventually moved out. That was hard, although she was so numb to it all I felt like she was my only grasp at what the truth was.
During the weeks leading up to my step dads trail- my mother bribed my friends and I to write fake notes about abuse I endured, she had me go to medical intervention facilities that interviewed Childrens of abuse, and told me if I did not tell them about abuse I endured I would lose everything new I had build and never see my family again, so I complied.
 
She tried to get me to testify in her case and that’s where I drew the line, and I refused. The day I refused to testify, she handed custody over to the state and told them that she didn’t want deal with my mental health issues any longer and she was requesting voluntary placement.. I was in various group homes over the course of 2 years until I turned about 17, learning along the way that he had won his trial fair and square. Every bullshit charge, she tried to push on him, including stocking, sexual assault, domestic violence, sexual assault on a child, all of the things that she had said had no merit, and no proof.
Even without fancy lawyers, or any of that- he won, because he was innocent. He knew it, and I knew it.
 
My mother went into a type of witness protection program for victims of domestic violence that requires no proof of anything that has happened called the ACP. She stayed under the radar from everyone after he won. I know he fought for custody for a long time and they couldn’t find her. she was granted a restraining order against him at the beginning of all of that, and it was never dropped because they could not find her. He paid her a large amount of child support through the registry up until I finally cut contact, butI don’t know what happened after that. I know he lost his son, after winning his freedom and reputation, so I’m sure he was devastated to say the least.
 
I ended up getting emancipated at 17 shortly after returning to my mother‘s custody due to her severe mental health, and a Dr sign off.
 
I tried to continue a relationship with my mother for two years following becoming an adult mostly because that was my only connection to my little brother, I was always too scared to call social services because of how manipulative she was, and how many people she could convince of anything she wanted.and I worried for my own children’s safety. So much of my family and people throughout my life cut her off because they were scared of her ruining their life. And I felt exactly the same
Eventually, the mind games and the mental abuse were so severe. I just couldn’t do it anymore and I had to cut ties. It was brutal, and I went through years of therapy with losing losing my brother, it was almost like I lost him to death because I knew I would never see him again, at least until he was 18.
 
My sister and I tried to have a relationship off and on, but she she seemed to develop similar traits to my mother and her mental health was too severe for me to continue a healthy relationship with. We both went on to have many children and found our own partners.
 I have since not seen my mother in over a decade.
 
From the information I was told from other relatives, including sister who stayed close with the her, my mother still sleeps all day. Her mental health and paranoia is so bad that she does not even live in reality anymore and often puts herself in stories like it is real life.. My brother is now 21, and is so mentally impaired because she never put him in school a day in his life, never let him have friends outside of the home, and he was always locked inside while she slept all day. He is now severely autistic, barely verbal, and will probably live with her until she dies. It’s sickening and another proof of failure of the system, as I know others have reported her and nothing was ever done.
 
I’ve actually reached out to him a few times by giving my phone number to people to give to him, as he’s not allowed to have social media or any sort of contact with the outside world online. He is a prisoner and I wish I could rescue him, I wish I would have done more when he was a child. . It’s like something out of a fucking horror movie. I don’t know how to get him help or get him he message that he is an adult and can make his own choices, but that’s a story for a different day.
 
There’s so many details in between that if I were to write it all out, it would be a fucking novel.
As an adult, I was diagnosed with PTSD and Munchhausen by proxy from the abuse I endured by my mother. Now that I have my own family and have done a lot of work on my own healing, I’ve raised my children in such a different environment.
 
the years I’ve had a strong inclination and feeling that I should reach out to him. Maybe it’s a feeling of guilt? Maybe it’s a feeling of needing recognition myself? I don’t know what it is. I don’t know what he thinks of me or of how much of the hell that he was put through was blamed on me, if any. Maybe that’s fear talking. but I feel like I need to make my peace.
 
My father and I were never close, he OD’d about two years ago, I had met him a few times and really desired a relationship with him, but he was always very unstable and had many kid He didn’t take care of and didn’t share the same feelings.
 
I think after his passing is when the feelings I had about my stepdad really came up strong. how really he gave me the only sense of normalcy in my entire childhood. He was the father I never had, And that he deserves a thank you. And he also deserves an apology for everything that my mother put him through. And although it’s not my job to apologize he fucking deserves to hear how much he meant to me.
But over the last few months I’ve had this feeling that if I don’t do it soon it’ll be too late. He still works at the same college two towns next to me. I’ve thought it over in my head 1000 times for years, do I need to write him a letter for closure for me? what do I want the outcome to be? Is it that I want him to be in my life? Is it fair to put him through hearing from me and ripping open that old wound? If I do write him a letter, how do I even fucking start it?
 
So it’s with this that I conclude, Reddit, I need your help.
 
Do I  write him a letter? Or leave the past buried?

1kk64j4,1746983907.0,2025-05-11 17:18:27,TrueOffMyChest,I had the worst nightmare in my life when I was 12.,"I am a male, 20 years old and I had something that happened to me when I was 12 that I can’t seem to forget. I don’t post on Reddit to much, it’s very rare that I do. I’m not looking for any sort of clout on here just looking for people’s opinions on what they think about this. 

A little context about this story. Growing up my parents were never together. Never got married. They had me in their younger  twenties. I was born in North Carolina. My mom decided to take me and move to Virginia to get away from my dad. I was not even a year old yet. I know the situation does sound messed up but my dad isn’t the best person. So ever since I was little I would be driven to North Carolina every other weekend to see my dad. 

The environment at my dad’s house was scary. He got married to my step mom which never treated me right. I felt like a burden. Every time I was over there they would always fight about me. I could hear the fighting even if I was in the farthest point of the house. My step mom hated me and didn’t include me because I wasn’t her own. On Christmas one year I remember I had to sit up stairs in my room because she wanted to celebrate Christmas with her kids. Other occasions I would be getting screamed at by my dad and step mom. I was around 10-15 when this was going on. My step mom didn’t like me because I was shy and didn’t talk too much. I think the main reason why I am [REDACTED_NAME] way I am [REDACTED_NAME] is because of all the mental and physical trauma from my step mom and dad. Anyway, my step mom had 3 kids. The only one that matters in this story is Maggie which is a fake name I’m using for this story. I liked maggie the most out of her children, we got along because we were close in age. Maggie was known for sleep walking in the house sometimes. It was rare but not surprising. 

So the story begins off with me being around 12 years old. I had to go to my dad’s house for the weekend. Started off like any other weekend. Got into my dad’s car and got screamed at because he hates child support and hates my mom. That was pretty typical of him. I would cry every-time I got into his car. He did that every weekend. This was in the summer so when I finally got back to my dad‘s house, we realized that the AC upstairs wasn’t working and I had the only room upstairs. It was just stairs that went directly to my room and that was the only room up there besides the attic so when I heard that the AC was out, it sucked because I couldn’t have my own space. Luckily my stepbrother wasn’t there this weekend so I got to stay in his room for the weekend and across from his room is Maggie’s room. Every kid has nightmares, but this one seemed to stick out. On Friday night I was falling asleep. I always lay on my stomach when I’m asleep. Even to this day I do this. So i finally did fall asleep.

Now i am [REDACTED_NAME] dream mode. In the dream i must have gone camping with my step mom and my step sister. We were staying in a log cabin. The log cabin was set up this way. Literally just two beds in it. That’s all I remember. The room was pretty dark and empty. Me and Maggie in the dream must have been playing and goofing off while my step mom was doing something else in the dream. All of a sudden this black demonic looking figure kicked the door down. It looked like some sort of demon that had a bunch of sharp poking objects poking out of it. It was also very tall. It was hard to get a good idea but I remember it having no face. I ran to my bed and laid down on it like I normally would. Face down on my stomach. I don’t know what happened to Maggie and my step mom but all I heard were screams. Then this demon got on top of me I felt the pressure on my butt because that’s where it was sitting. In the dream it started clawing at my back. Shaking me violently. Choking me from the back. I remember crying and screaming in the dream. 

Then I woke up. The dream wasn’t the scariest part. When I woke up I still felt the pressure of the creature. I still felt the clawing, the choking, and the violent shaking. This time I could hear my bed making noises from all the movement. I didn’t know what to do besides scream. I couldn’t move because it was on top of me. But luckily whatever it was got off. I felt it get off. Then I quickly turned over to get a good look at what it was. All I saw was this glimpse of something leaving my room. It was definitely a creature of some sort. Whether it was human or not. It looked like it was wearing a robe. I was petrified and wide awake. I was debating on going to get my dad. But I was to scared to go out there and see the creature and also my dad would probably whoop my ass if I did go get him. I wasn’t aloud to lock the door, and if I did I would get in trouble. So I turned the tv on in the room and just stayed awake the whole night. Scared that if I fall back asleep it would happen again. So I stayed awake watching fear factor, i remember the episode too. It was these people that were terrified of bees. I stayed awake until sunrise and then i finally went back to sleep knowing that it was light outside. The dream and what happened wasn’t even the scariest part. When I woke back up later mid day. I went to my dad and told him what happened. So he decided to check my back. Low and behold my back was red from scratches. It looked like someone just ripped into my back from the top to the bottom. My dad didn’t think anything of it though. I don’t know if he cared. 

I still get goosebumps every time I tell someone this story. It was definitely the most scariest thing I’ve ever been through. I don’t have sleep paralysis. Never have had any other situation happen to me like this. It could be one of two things that happened. It could have been Maggie that sleep walks and she could have been the one that got on top of me and shook me. But it wouldn’t really make sense if it was her because why did I have the dream. How come the dream lined up perfectly with real life. I don’t think it could have been her. I’d love to get y’all’s feedback on this. Give me your opinions. I have no reason to lie about this. I just wanted my story to get out there. Thanks for reading.

yzq9zr,1668903423.0,2022-11-20 00:17:03,TrueOffMyChest,Just wanted to get my story out about my wife's infidelity,"Hi all, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] here and to Reddit in general, but found this sub after I started dating my current wife, a redditor (Hi!)  and its been eye opening to read what everyone's gone through. I decided to share my story of my ex wife L as a kind of airing out of the whole thing, to help myself order my thoughts on everything. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] hoping to help out anyone on here to who's currently in a relationship with a wayward spouse and isn't sure what to do. Maybe this will help push you to get out of a toxic spot and take what you deserve from life. 

I grew up on a 26 acre horse farm out in rural Ohio. Growing up I was a loner, and preferred reading books to talking to people. Only ever had a few girlfriends (if  middle school even counts) and didnt really put the effort in to actually have a relationship with much of anyone besides a few close friends. My parents had gotten divorced when I was young. I lived with my mom and saw dad every other weekend. This did have an effect on me growing up, mainly that I had a hard time knowing what a healthy relationship looked like, and didn't really have time with dad to have a healthy male role model. 

Mom had a series of boyfriends, some of which were physically abusive to my brother and I. I remember getting backhanded across a room at 10 by one of them, or belted anytime anything at all was out of order. Another one used glue traps for the mice in the garage and made us watch when he'd cut them off the traps, which he'd do by cutting all their legs off before throwing the still living, legless mouse in the trashcan. Real gem that one. 

I learned very quickly to just keep my mouth shut and act generally pleasant, because anything else might get me punished, usually hit. This also made me develop an unhealthy attitude of just grin and bear it, dont have issues and if people were bad to me I'd just take it. 

Whenever I could I would recess into myself and my books. I was a voracious reader, had over a thousand books on [REDACTED_ADDRESS]acked bookshelves in my bedroom. I'd hide in there in the winter, once all the chores were done. Anytime the weather was good enough I'd be outside, reading in the forest, out in the hay field, and spent a lot of time over in the old cemetary across our field. It was beautiful but looking back, probably not the most healthy lifestyle. 

Sorry for the backdrop dump, but through some therapy I've come to realize that my upbringing put me in a vulnerable spot for staying with an abusive partner. My hangups and coping mechanisms just led me to tolerate a lot of intolerable behavior from people. 

L and I met when we were in our mid teens (at a church lock-in that neither one of us wanted to be at of all things) and hit it off right off the bat. She was one of those mid 00's quirky girls, writing weird poetry, yelling spork, all the standard stuff at the time, and decently attractive with curly hair. She came up and challenged me to an air hockey game and you know how the rest of that story goes. 

We dated pretty much exclusively for the next 7 years. Finished high school together, went to the same college, even got the same scholarship to attend the same local state college. We had our ups and downs, but I put that down just how relationships must be. She was erratic at the best of times, tried isolating me from the few friends I had because ""they were jealous of her taking all my time"". She'd cry over the smallest stuff, hit me when she was mad over things I had nothing to do with, and just generally pester me to shower her with love. She needed constant validation from everyone around her, and wasn't too shy about trying to get it. 

I put up with all this because she was my first real girlfriend, and she was great at just minimizing her bad behavior into something I was ""just too dumb to get"". I'd just think she was being irrational but would put up with it to get back to our normal lives. 

College was where the more obvious red flags started coming. Within a few months of her coming to college she was constantly hanging around with other dudes in our dorm (honors dorm, there were all male and all female ""suites"" that shared a building). I would ask if we were still good and get positive answers, but then find her sitting on some guys lap in his room later that same night. Multiple times I caught her making out with randoms and just generally behaving inappropriately with guys. 

After I told her everything I'd seen and threatened to break up with her if she didn't tell me the truth, it came out that she'd given one other guy oral, which she described in excruciating detail. She said she was obsessed with him because, no lie, ""he looks like the guy from Napoleon Dynamite and is just really hot."" Yes. Should have ended everything we had right there for that comment alone but we'd been together for nearly 5 years at that point, so I thought we could fix things and reconcile. 

I confronted the guy, she cut off contact, and things got better for a bit. I ended up getting a decent job with a local construction company my junior year of college and saved up enough in six months to make a down payment on a house. This was in 2008 in an older steel town, so housing values were pretty much rock bottom. I talked it over with L and we decided to buy a house fairly close by our school and just start our life together while we finished up college. We also got engaged shortly after moving in. I thought that by removing her from the coed dorm I'd fix her cheating issues, and it really did seem to work for a bit. All in all it seemed like life was looking up. 

There were some good years for a while. She got a job selling books, then went on for a graduate degree. Actually, she tried for 4 different graduate degrees but kept quitting because they weren't what she wanted to do. I payed for the ones she couldn't get a scholarship or student loans for and just generally supported her and her decisions. We got a dog, and some cats. I kept working at that same construction job, for a boss I hated but it paid the bills. Got married in 2010 when we were 23. Kids, dont get married young, you don't know what a good relationship is yet. 

I want to get across here that it was exactly what I thought the good life was. I'd get up early, give her a kiss and head into work, where I'd occasionally get reprimanded at for not reading my bosses mind. I'd do drafting and job takeoffs, or going to a jobsite and wear myself out doing whatever work they needed, since it was a small business and everyone wore a lot of hats. Then I'd come home, let the dog out and listen to L tak about her day. If I complained about my day I ""wasn't being manly enough and was just adding to her stress"", so I'd just start making dinner or mow the lawn, whatever. Rinse and repeat.. I thought this was completely normal and maybe even better than average. 

The wheels really started to come off, though I didn't know it for a while, when L got a new job with a local energy company doing mapping. She was finally making more than minimum wage, and was only there for a few months before her bosses boss took notice of her. 

I don't think it was 4 months before suddenly she's getting a job as a ""process assistant"" in a large nearby city, which was a two hour drive for her. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure of the details, but within those same few months she started an emotional and eventual physical affair with her new boss. Still don't know what to think of this, since the guy was 30 years older than her, was recently separated from his wife and was literally living in his moms basement. 

I noticed she was withdrawing more than usual from the relationship, but figured it was the stress from a big corporate job and the drive. I tried putting in more effort, surprising her with gifts and stuff, but nothing really landed. Again, I just figured she'd get used to the work and things would go back to normal. 

In January 2013 we moved to Cleveland to be closer to her work. I found a new and much better job, we got a really nice place for less than market price, and everything was shiny again. Sure, she had to work really late quite often, but you know, thats corporate. She'd gotten a pay raise for her ""excellent work"". L was making new work friends and was finally coming out of her shell a bit. 

L also started going out with work friends a lot and quickly started staying out very late and coming home drunk as a skunk, which led to more than a few fights between us. Things detiorated, and again we just settled into a new equilibrium where we talked less to each other and when we did talk it would be the most milquetoast of topics. 

In December 2014 we went down to see her parents in Texas, and had a great trip. It really seemed to rekindle some of those feelings we'd been missing, and it really made me realize that things were more messed up in our relationship than I thought. When we got back I had a real moment with L where I told her that I really had a great time and want to keep being as invested in each other as we were on the trip. I felt like I had a kind of epiphany where I knew we could change our relationship for the better, and I was inviting her to help me with it. 

She screamed. Straight up looked at me with panicked eyes, stuttered, SCREAMED, and ran away down to the basement. I followed trying to figure out just what I had said that would have led to THAT reaction, which led to her accusing me of cornering her in the basement. I backed off and she, through tears, tells me that she doesn't deserve love. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to ask her what this is about, get nothing from her, and we finally just go into separate rooms to calm down. The next day I tried to bring it up and she told me in no uncertain terms that none of that happened, and if I bring it up again she's leaving. Straight up denied that she freaked out, that we had even seen each other the day before. 

I (pbviously) got really suspicious that something was up after that point, but I didn't really think it was cheating. More just that she was being insecure. She'd always been very insecure in general, just never to a level that made her freak out like that. 

After that episode I decided that my teenage self was correct, that having a roommate who is occasionally funny and sometimes slept with me was about as good a relationship as I would ever get. I had a prejudice against divorce after seeing how my moms life had turned out afterward, so I decided I'd just make this work however I could. The staying out, drinking, and random outbursts kept going on her end, and I decided to just never bring up my feelings unless she asked directly. 

Meanwhile, I decided to work on myself first, to be a better more interesting partner. I started building up my home gym, working out, got into backpacking and woodworking, things that I aways kind of liked but ""never had time for"". L had complained that I had no hobbies, and wasn't interesting enough for her around this time, so I took her at her word that this would help more than actually talking about our issues. This is one of the few good things that came out of the relationship, as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] pretty physically fit and look much better than ever before in my life. Plus my woodworking and turning have turned into a lot of useful life skills. 

Dday was in April of 2015. She came home from a night out with ""friends"" insanely drunk. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not sure how she made it home. She threw up multiple times while I held her hair, then passed out on the floor by the toilet. She was so drunk she would breath in these odd gasps, and I thought she was just going to stop breathing at one point. I thought about calling an ambulance but just decided to wait it out a bit. 

She had her phone beside her on the floor and it kept getting texts, which I ignored for a while. Finally thought it was probably someone checking to see if she got home okay, so I decide to open it with her thumbprint and respond. 

The texts are all from her boss, and the last one was something along the lines of ""you only went home because you're mad I made you stop. We can't do it in the office anymore, F will catch us."" 

I immediately understand what is happening and feel like the stupidest dude ever that I didn't put it together at any point in the last 2-3 years. I still feel dumb about it, we were young but thats no excuse to be so naive and checked out about your marriage. I had always just assumed we had grown distant, but I had never once thought of cheating on her and just assumed she felt the same way. 

I start going through all her texts with him and see that this has been going on for a while, though its unclear when it went from being an EA instead of a good working relationship and then again on when the physical stuff started. I did find a message from earlier that same night (between pics down her shirt from the bar where they were at) were they were talking about the next time they'd meet up, just a week or so away. 

I decided that if I tell her anything at this point she's going to flip it around into me snooping and misreading, or misrembering what I read since ""I have a terrible memory"" (guessing now that was just her gaslighting me to cover up her own indiscretions). Instead of confronting her I go out and buy a voice recorder, and spend a few days placing it in her car before work to find a good hidden spot and test how long it can record for. I also scope out where they're planning on meeting up so I can find it day of. 

The day before the meet up she had told me she needed to go to a separate nearby town for work and that she'd be late coming home. I tell her it's fine, and take your time coming home. Inside I was all nerves, but apparently held it together enough to keep her from being suspicious. 

The hours pass, then around 6 pm I head out and drive to a spot near the bar they're meeting at and wham, there they are. Both in her car, pawing each other and making out. I just drove away, went home, had some shots and cried. She came home later that night and I didn't say anything about it, just made us some dinner. She was all bubbley about how well her meeting had gone, thanked me for being understanding. After she went to bed I went out and got the voice recorder and listened through it, and heard her begging to go back to their office to do the deed, amongst other things. I couldn't even figure out how to react, she was never like this at home and sounded nearly deranged in how much she wanted to be with him. 

I listen through this all, go in and wake her up and tell her we need to talk. I ask if she's cheating, she denies. I ask her about the name of the bar she was at, she denies even knowing what it is. I tell her I was there earlier today and saw some interesting things, she immediately asked if I followed her, how could I, and ""is there a tracker in my car? You have to tell me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to have a panic attack you can't just track me."" 

Again, insane. I tell her I read her texts from a few weeks ago, and went to the bar where she said she was meeting S, her boss. This turns into opening her phone to show me no such texts exist anymore, which I think she thought would negate the fact I went there and saw them? So crazy thinking about it. 

Finally, she says that yes, she's been seeing S, they've been together ""a few times"" and, finally, if I make her stop seeing him she won't love me anymore. Somehow, this WORKS on me. I had no self confidence, didn't like divorce as an institution, and figured being with someone to split the bills was better than being alone. And for a few months that was it. She'd have meetups with him, I would try to talk her out of it. There were crazy moments, S had other girlfriends and L knew about them, and got jealous of them. One time she came home, sobbing, and I hugged her while she told me that she thought S was breaking up with her for someone else. I just went still inside. I don't think I felt anything other than a kind of ironic humor in it, like an eyerolling feeling. Still don't know why I stuck around after that. And of course they kept seeing each other. Around this point she also started having ONS with random other guys. I found out about a few of them over the years and suspect a few more. 

Finally I drove myself into having a panic disorder and decided enough was enough. I gave her the voice recorder and demanded she break it off with S and record herself while she's telling him or I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. She cries but finally relents. The next day she does what I asked. When S found out I knew he immediately panicked, and I got to watch those texts come in on Ls new apple watch that she didn't realize doesn't delete texts that you remove from your phone. 

Things settled a bit, and we went to marriage counseling for a session. I agreed to not tell the counselor about her infidelity this session, as the condition for L to even go. The counselor then spent the whole session telling me I was smothering L by wanting to go through her phone and know wheres she at, which I only started doing after the cheating. We never went back. 

That was 2[REDACTED_PHONE]. After that we stayed together, and about twice a year I'd find some new infidelity. Once she was drunk and did oral on a guy she works with in the bathroom. Once on a work trip out of state she started texting a guy and started the weirdest EA I've ever heard of, a decent chunk of his texts were about how his grandma had to wipe his butt until he was in his mid teens and he liked it. 

The whole time I just got used to pain shopping, it almost became a game for us, where she'd find out how I found out, would swear to stop seeing/talking to/ screwing so and so while also disconnecting her apple watch, or not using her car, etc. Looking back I just kind of got used to it? I checked out of the relationship in any real sense. Funny enough we'd have fights about me not being invested in the relationship during this time too. 

I finally had enough when I got a message out of the blue from one of her coworkers wives, N. She'd caught her husband and L texting and snapping. She sent screenshots of them to me, and said that she wanted me to know. The screenshots really drove home to me that L wasn't just prone to straying, or was making mistakes over and over. I know, I know, its dumb but when you're in the relationship, if you excuse one thing it gets easier the next time, and I had gotten to the point of excusing everything. We'd have our ritual fight over it, she'd end the affair, and the cycle begins again in a few months. 

In the screenshots from N, L was saying things like ""I should have done you the first time I saw you"", setting up meetings, etc. I confronted L with the texts and her first reaction was annoyance that the guy didn't hide it from his wife better. It blew my mind, and when I was talking with N it was obvious she was crushed. They had 2 kids and her husband's actions were likely going to tear the family apart, and here's my loving wife mad that he was ""too dumb to hide it properly"" and she ""knew he couldn't handle this sort of relationship"". N sent me some texts later on after the affair was in the open of L telling the guy that there's a theres basically a code of conduct for cheaters and this guy didn't follow the rules. 

I snapped out of it. Like I finally felt awake after 6 years of affairs, and 10 years before that of just general abuse and incoherence. I moved into the finished half of the basement, slept on an air mattress by my gym, and started drawing up dissolution papers. I figured if the dissolution failed I could always hire an attorney and get a divorce. I ghosted L as hard as I could being in the same home, 100% grey rock. 

L started lovebombing me, in her own weird way. One time I got home from work and she'd bought a lamp for the basement, and put it by my air mattress. Probably the sweetest thing she'd ever done for me lol. 

To drive home everything, a few days later she's working from home in the afternoon and doesn't hear me go into the kitchen for a drink. I can hear she's on speakerphone on the couch, and it's S, still her boss and the guy all of this started with. I hear him ask if she's alone, and she says yes.
I think ""really? Really. Right now, as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the dissolution, in the same house, she's going to indulge this guy."" I creep closer and listen in. He starts talking about how he's never done it in a car in an automated car wash, and thinks that would be fun. WTF. Just like, where does she find these guys? I just walk in, get behind her head on the couch, yell ""Hi S! Nice hearing from you!"" 

L jumps and nearly falls off the couch, S just immediately hangs up, and I laugh and go to put on my shoes. L yells in ""That was rude!"" I laugh again and get my coat. L asks where I'm [REDACTED_NAME], I say ""Out"". I must have said it in a way where she finally got it that we are DONE, we have been done, and now I just wrapping it up. She runs up and blocks the door. I tell her to move and she gets this weird little smile on her face, I still remember it. Like all this was still a game, that if she blocks the door then I'll just have to stay and we'll still be married, that her plan to keep me by physically blocking the door has no chance of failing and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] stuck now. 

I grabbed her by her shoulders and picked her up and moved her. Just feet off the floor right over to the side of the door, then gently back down on her feet. Told her if she tries to keep me here I will take her apart, because I don't have it in me anymore to deal with her and all the anger I'd been pushing down my whole life was still all right there. I had never touched her violently, and still never have, but that was the closest I got. 

I drove off to one of my favorite local bars, hung out with friends I'd been making the last few years. I texted L that I knew she had another work trip coming up that next week, and that when she got back she wouldn't be welcome back in the house. Lucky me, she never came back. Moved in with a guy she'd been seeing down there, where they both lived in his brothers dining room since said guy was unemployed and living with his brother. Again, gems. Her cheating life was a regular gem mine. 

I only saw her a few times after that. She signed the paperwork I sent her with next to no changes. I used the threat that her company would fire both her and her boss if I told them of the relationship they'd carried on if she tried to be difficult, which got me the house, my car, and less than half of the over $20,000 in credit card debt I didn't know she'd racked up. Also none of my retirement accounts got touched, which is a blessing. She came back to Ohio to sign the paperwork in December 2019 and brought her new guy, which was about as awkward as you'd expect. New guy seemed to think that I was at fault for the divorce for being abusive, and he was there in case I got violent. Again, I had never hurt her, and that includes when she'd get violent with me. I'd just pin her arms and wait for her to stop trying to hit me. I never told him that she'd cheated on me, because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure he was one of thr guys she did it with so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] he already knows. 

The other time she came back for her stuff that was still in the house, while I watched her pack up. A few months had passed. She told me she got a new apartment, and that New Guy had moved in without asking. She found out when he was helping her move and sat the urn with his dead dad in it on her table. She gave me a weird, ""help me"" look and I just laughed. 

After that I didn't see her again. Within a week of the divorce I got cold approached by a girl at a concert and got her number, then again at a local event. Within a month I was actively dating 4 people, all of which were better than L in every way. My friend said that I had that fresh on the market vibe, lol. I was just happy for the first time in a very long time, and it made it easy to attract people. 

I calmed down a bit on the dating, though I did have a few girlfriends. Doubled down on my workout routine. Went to Peru and hiked the Cordillera Blanca mountains, and almost got stuck there when C19 hit. Got into my ancestry after a 23&Me test and found a weird little utopian commune that was founded by a guy with my last name, though its mostly historical buildings now. 

L tried to stay in contact over the last few years, sometimes for actual important things, mostly bull just trying to keep me in her life somehow. I ignore it, though I've got some funny insights. Like how the new guy immediately started ""fake proposing"" multiple times a week, and it was freaking her out. She texted me once saying that taxes suck as a single so she's getting married for tax reasons. When she found out I had found someone and gotten engaged she sent a congratulations card to the house that she had hand painted herself, which immediately went in the trash. Or the fact that new guy was recently diagnosed with MS. I don't see L sticking around and suddenly finding her caring side to take care of a dude 10 years her senior with a neurological issue. 

In August 2020 I encountered my current wife, C. Shes amazing, had gotten out of a bad marriage with a guy who seems a mirror image of L. We hit it off when I was talking with a buddy of mine and I said ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] looking for someone normal"", she heard me and we both looked at each other for a second with a funny ""me too!"" look. Got married after two years of dating this last September, and we've never even fought once in the last year. She takes care of me, I take care of her, we talk every day and it's always beautiful. It's really tough to describe, but she's the one. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] much better now. I look back on all that, on literally half of my life, and wonder why I stayed for so long and through so much, especially when it was so easy to find someone so perfect afterwards. If any of you made it this far and are currently in a bad relationship and wondering what to do, I get it. I think most of us get it. You put up with stuff that you think you never would. You think that this person you've put so much effort into can't be doing this on purpose. You'll excuse next to anything. You actively make yourself into a doormat. 

Its not worth it. Just get out, because whatever led to cheating once, it'll happen again, and again after that.  Cheaters will tell themselves whatever they need to, to not feel bad about themselves and their actions. They will always justify it,
to themselves and to you, and you'll always wonder what they're doing when they're not with you. You deserve better. 

So leave, cut losses, do whatever you need to. My hangup on divorce and low self confidence kept me in way longer than I ever should have, and nothing that happened in the relationship in the years after I found out helped me in any way. The only person that can get you into a better headspace is yourself and focusing on you and the people that actually care about you. It gets better once you leave.",84
12je7kd,1681285277.0,2023-04-12 07:41:17,TrueOffMyChest,"I struggled with Depression and Betrayal. But I'm healing, and I'm ready to tell my story.","**Trigger Warning: My story goes into heavy detail regarding Depression and Suicidal Ideation. Other topics I touch on are Emotional Abuse, Anxiety, Bullying, Self-Harm, and Trauma.**

Also, this is LONG. Sorry about that.

TL;DR: I struggled with Depression and trusted someone I had known for years with my innermost thoughts and feelings. He went to my abusive ex-boyfriend and told him about it. Because I cut him off, I got kicked out of my friend group and fell back into Depression. Now, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to say ""I have struggled with Depression."" in a room full of people.

Almost two years ago, my trust was broken in a way I had never expected.

Let me start from the beginning...

I met someone who would become one of my best friends while I was in Community College. We were close for six years, I considered him a brother. He saw me through changing my major. He was there for me when I was in an abusive relationship. He helped me sort through my feelings when I finally ended that relationship. He defended me when the same ex was stalking me. He celebrated with me when I got my Bachelor's Degree. He was there when I was rejected by a guy I crushed on for two years. When I needed him, he would come running. He didn't mind going on adventures with me at the drop of a hat. I could always count on him if I needed to get out of the house to talk, vent, rant, or rave. Before anyone asks, we have different sexual orientations. Translation: We were Just Friends. No romantic contact.

Or so I thought.

Summer of 2020. I can't put my finger on when my mental health started deteriorating. I stopped doing the hobbies I loved, I grew to resent the Zoom Meetings my Social Group provided to the point I stopped participating and made excuses to stop going to them, I became more easily irritable, everything and everyone save for a few select people could just piss off. I brushed it off, blaming it on missing school and my studies. Big mistake, I know. Maybe I could have gotten help earlier, maybe I could have recognized the signs of my declining mental state. No, it had to be an anxiety attack in the middle of the mall in October. With my aforenoted best friend there to see it all. I still remember wandering around the stores, seeing the distanced people in lines, feeling dizzy and disoriented, feeling paralyzed in my own mind. I still remember walking down the parking garage stairs, debating if I should jump off. I remember the deafeningly silent ride when he took me home. I was convinced he was going to abandon me and didn't want me around. Neither of us was talking. I think all I managed was ""Thank you.""

I still thank god I told my Mom everything, even if it was collapsing into her arms bawling my eyes out.

 My depression got worse. Sometimes I would go silent on my friends because I was convinced everyone hated me and wanted nothing to do with me. (Writing this now, I realize that he never reached out to me whenever this happened.) I listened to ungodly sad songs instead of my usual upbeat happy ones. I remember the times I would look in the mirror and not recognize the girl in the reflection. I would make posts on Twitter screaming into the void, expressing my pain, and geez am I glad my account was Private! (This was because my abusive Ex was stalking and harassing me online, which he was aware of.) There were times that I thought of ending it all, even going as far as researching methods, but I never went through with it. I have friends with Developmental Disabilities that I've known practically my whole life, I couldn't burden them with the pain of losing a best friend. I couldn't make their parents have to find the words to explain Suicide. 

I told this guy everything I was experiencing to the last detail. I trusted him with my life. He listened to my rants, comforted me when I was down, and validated everything I felt. His friendship was one of my reasons to live. I didn't want to cause him pain.

Come Spring of 2021, the dark cloud had begun to lift. I went HARD in my last semester of University, and it paid off with graduating on the Dean's list. We celebrated by going out to eat Italian. We also celebrated my first Full-Time Job. We went on an adventure to the City after I was rejected by my crush. I was getting better, and I really thought I was overcoming this heavy weight in my life.

The next thing I knew, he was dating someone. You would think he would've told me, but no. I found out when I Skyped him and he was in a hotel. Maybe he wanted to spare my feelings after being rejected? I don't know. Listen, I wasn't jealous, I was genuinely happy for him. I thought he found a real-deal partner. At least, until I got to know his partner better. His partner was pressuring him to move in together, which from what I knew about his comfort level, wasn't something he would be too keen on. I talked to him about this, and he confirmed he wasn't ready for this major step. It was my turn to listen and be there for him, which I did. I helped him tell his partner he wasn't ready to move in with him, which his partner didn't take well. I distanced myself from his partner, which I now recognized as bad news. My friend told me he was wary of this guy, and that he was going to be careful around him.

Then came a time when I needed him. My illness was acting up again. But this time, he was nowhere to be found.

He ignored all my calls and messages for a week. This wasn't like him, we would talk every day, and he would pick up whenever I called.

I come to find out that he told my abusive ex-boyfriend about my depression.

Yes, the same ex that stalked me and sent me threatening messages, which I went to the Police with. In fact, my friend was well aware of this, and was even threatened in these messages! When I finally got a hold of him, he told me that he had gone to my ex. He was upset because I was ""Slandering his partner"" who was ""A good guy"". He wouldn't tell me what he talked about, so I have no idea if he told my ex about my anxiety attack or my suicidal ideation.

I ended a 6-year long friendship, which was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. Honestly, it was worse than all my breakups combined. My depression spiraled out of control once again. I found myself back in that dark hole that I worked hard to climb out of. Once again, I was considering taking my own life. What was even worse was that I convinced myself that I was the reason all of this was happening, which got so bad that I scraped my arms up using a nail file. I only did this a couple of times, and I honestly can't describe how it felt (In a bad way). It hurt, don't get me wrong, and it's NOT a healthy coping mechanism. 

Part of the aftermath included being excommunicated from other friends who went to the same Community College. I noticed that mutual friends were distancing themselves from me and I was being excluded from events in favor of my Ex-Friend. One of the girls I was close to was talking to a boyfriend I had at the time about the situation. She lied about me talking shit about my ex-friend and his partner. Which I found very interesting, considering that she was practically begging me to forgive him when this first happened. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to say that he entertained these lies, despite hearing the situation from my side. This was the nail in the coffin for this girl. I told her that I was done with her friendship and called her out for telling lies to my boyfriend. (What the lies were, he didn't tell me.) She refused to take responsibility and remarked that ""If I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to make a big deal out of something so small, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] really being an adult."" 

Yeah, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a big deal out of broken trust that affected my mental health to the point I harmed myself and considered suicide.

Thankfully, this story has a happy ending.

I stopped talking to people in that friend group and started attending a Cooking Class in my Social Group almost a year ago. I met two others that I can confidently call my Best Friends. In fact, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] one of them. We've been together for almost 9 months and this is the healthiest relationship I've ever been in! I also have another Bestie who has seen me through this whole show and has been [REDACTED_PHONE]% supportive ever since I took her up on her offer to email her if I ever needed to talk. When I was betrayed, she took my ex-friend's place as my best friend, and she's not sorry about it. Honestly, she deserves this title. She is someone I can trust and someone I KNOW won't go behind my back. It helps that she hates my ex with the heat of a thousand suns.

Mentally, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a much better place. I've started painting and writing again! Which is HUGE since I stopped this when I got sick. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] regaining my sense of self, I can recognize the stronger girl staring back at me in the mirror. I can start to say that I have overcome Depression. Depression will never truly go away, but I now know that I can manage my illness. 

Recently, I was invited to speak on a panel at one of my Alma Maters regarding something I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about. Even better, I have the opportunity to speak among other experts in the field! I accepted the chance to speak about my experiences.

If the opportunity comes up, I will say that I have struggled with depression.

When I was betrayed, I was absolutely petrified to tell others about my condition. I felt as though the world knew about my struggle. My ex-friend told a story that was never his to tell. He told my most vulnerable feelings to a person who had no problem putting me down every chance he got for two long years. I took a chance in sharing my illness with my partner and my new friends. And here I am, taking another chance in sharing my story with you. But the difference is that I am [REDACTED_NAME] one telling you this story, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this on my terms. I am [REDACTED_NAME] the power back from someone who violated my trust. I have made the decision to do this because maybe I can inspire someone to reach out to a friend in need, someone to get the help they need, or someone to challenge their misconceptions about people with mental illness.

No, Hater-taters, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to hijack the platform and talk about my whole story. That's just going to take away from the other experts on the panel and just derail the whole thing. Sorry, not sorry!

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] conductor of my own crazy train, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] starting to realize that!",3
ymif1d,1667617329.0,2022-11-05 03:02:09,TrueOffMyChest,I realized why my former “friend” lied about me and invalidated my trauma by accusing me of doing it to her. (I'm sorry this is super long.),"This is going to be long -- but this is honestly the shortened version of my story that glosses over so many details to save people their reading energy and me from an emotional breakdown and anxiety attack. If you want more information just ask, but I will not reveal personal info/accounts. 

Long story short, due to a joke that she pushed for years in a gaming roleplay server, she used it to lie behind my back in other servers I didn’t know existed, using my trauma — which she knew about — against me, that being pedophilia. 

I was repeatedly molested by my own biological father. This person accused me of grooming and forcing her to have her under age character in a relationship with my adult character.
The joke was ***that I’m so overprotective of my friends that you could almost consider me a platonic-yandere*** she pushed the ship for a long time despite me begging her to let me end the joke because I wanted to do something else with my character who wouldn’t really have such a relationship in the first place nor care about her character in such away (he was meant to be a murderous villain).

I noticed she had a huge lying problem and taking my words completely out of context and even did such things to other people. Even going as far as to throw an absolute tantrum over people using a chatroom that had one of her dead rps in, she went as far as claiming everyone hated her — this was something she did multiple times a week *minimum*. Out of desperation to get out of that rp state I went behind her back to change my character completely. It was something I had been dying to do because of how uncomfortable I was and bored of the joke. It had went too far and I had learned she had talked shit about the rp-ship so much that I didn’t know what to believe anymore.

She had a meltdown over this.

It was horrific and led to us fighting, which was practically routine at this point. But it escalated to me being betrayed by my online friend group, and finding out that she had said far more horrendous things about me. Claiming I forced her into the joke and forced it to continue. Calling me a pedo despite knowing my past. The others in that friend group knew about my past and hand access to those servers and even saw those vents of hers and ignored them. They refused to look at my evidence while claiming to care about me and wanting to hear my side.

It has been years since this. I cut them all out and haven’t heard from them. Reddit is the only app I use know aside from youtube.

That girl was an artist, like myself, though her skill level was extremely low, still is after checking her tumblr after all these years. I gave up my craft completely due to the trauma of all the betrayal. I made a few new friends, two of whom knew her, one of which -- much like myself -- knew her IRL (we live in the same town, thankfully I haven't seen her -- I don't think I'd react well.). He stated that he got bad vibes from her because she claimed her parents were overly religious and wouldn't let her play MTG with him, so he asked her if she'd be okay if he asked them himself. She agreed and once he asked them, her parents were actually enthusiastic about it, asking if he knew where to buy the cards and such. He was shocked at how enthusiastic and rather interested in the game they were. He realized that she lied to him because next day she came in with a deck and was ready to learn how to play and everything.

It took this morning for me to piece it all together.

I remembered how in a moment of frustration and rage during the ""drama"", I stated that all her characters were basically the same OC in different hats -- I still stand by this because any time yo[REDACTED_USER] character were to not pay absolute attention to her and her character, she'd throw a ""You hate me, I know it!"" meltdown.

That friend I bonded with, stated that she had claimed that you had to be *born* with talent. No one can learn to be talented in her eyes. She once admitted in one of those secret vents of hers that she was jealous of me... Of my skills of writing and drawing. I have offered my help in many ways, I was always open to help. I gave advice when asked, but she never did.

This was my realization:

She wanted to be a tortured artist. She believed that that being mentally ill was cool. She knew I had PTSD, she was online when I had hallucinated my biological father's voice and was so paranoid I couldn't sleep, and was even online when I had my first Anxiety Attack where I felt like I couldn't breathe and had to be taken to the ER because I thought I was dying.

This realization came while I was at work, listening to random youtube videos that looked interesting. One was entitled ***the desire to be sad: ""tragically beautiful"" art & romanticizing mental illness***. Not even 5 minutes in and it clicked.

It all made so much sense.

She has so many tumblr accounts -- I learned of all of them when I had an account and was trying to block her only to find that she had over 20 accounts for who knows what reason. I wanted to make sure she had no way of contacting me because I didn't want to be guilt tripped anymore. I didn't want to be blamed for things I didn't even know were a problem or that I did unknowingly, or anything anymore. I was tired. I had already been harassed by my IRL friends multiple times while dealing with a stalker while dealing with her at the same time. I was exhausted.

It was hell...

It was something I'm [REDACTED_NAME] would make whatever Christian Devil shudder.

A hell I can't find an emotion to describe.

It broke me.

Broke me so bad I nearly took my life.

To compare me to the man that took my innocence when I was 5 and continued to ruin me...

I can't describe how evil such a thing is. It is something I wish I could cry about but I can't because I have forced myself to learn not to during that time of my life. That hellish chapter that I never wanted to return to but this vile person and her posse threw me into for internet points that made no sense nor was ever going to give them what they wanted.

No one is born with skill. Some people who are tall don't have the skill or the will to play basketball while people half their size are jealous of their height while refusing to acknowledge the skills that they possess.

It took me years to even gain the skills that I had. To be able to write, to be able to draw. It took me so long. My passion for drawing came from escapism and wanting to draw the ""evil pokemon"" I saw in youtube slideshow music videos that were semi-popular in the early-early 2000s. My passion for writing came from reading and my insecurity in not knowing how to draw backgrounds. I went as far as reading so much fanfiction I'd discover words that I didn't know, thus going as far as looking in the dictionary to find them and even going into the thesaurus to find new words that meant the same things or could get the same feeling across without sounding repetitive. It isn't that hard to draw, it is hard to learn. It isn't that hard to write, it is hard to articulate.

You have to learn to look at what you're doing and ask yourself ""where do I go from here?"".

I learned quickly that I had to not press down on the paper so hard, so that it is easier to erase my mistakes. I learned that I can't keep all my words jumbled together in a single blob and that pacing them and separating them makes for an easier and digestible read such as it is now despite the... rough topics.

I wish she would've just stopped and realized what she was doing was wrong... But I know that is asking for too much from her. I wish the same from the others and know they too would find it to be too much to ask for.

I've learned that you can't ask plastic to be wood.

If one of ***you*** are reading this, I don't forgive you. At all. I never will. I doubt that this will ever be something I could forgive. I've waited years and I've had nothing but silence. I could've died and you all wouldn't have cared. You all probably would've celebrated, actually. But I realize my place in your world and I accept it and I refuse to participate.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] villain you wanted to make and use, but I refuse to participate. I refuse to be the villain you want. I will be the villain that refuses to do anything for you. I will not play my part. I will never interact with you. I will never ever hurt you or anyone, no matter your claims or your demands that I do so.

It's so funny, looking back at all of this... And realize how stupid and blind I was. I was so consumed with my homework, chores, dealing with my stalker, and stress at home. I didn't even take the time to think for five fucking minutes.

If... this person sounds familiar, run. Don't look back. Just run. Don't be me. Whatever you do... don't be like me. Don't linger there. Just run.

These people are pathetic. They are so fucking pathetic. It is not fun to be mentally ill. It is not fun or cool to be depressed and have anxiety and flashbacks that horrify you to the point of questioning your own reality. To have memories you can't escape from.

People who desire such things... they're fucking pathetic.",6
n8jcmm,1620582404.0,2021-05-09 17:46:44,TrueOffMyChest,I had a terrible experience with my ex to the point that I considered suicide. I'm okay now but still wanted to share my story,"This story starts like many other stories often do, from the beginning. For not going too deep into the pre-story context, I met this girl when I was in high school. We never really talked, but we acknowledged each other's existence. 

Fast forward to around March or April 2020, and all of a sudden she reacts to one of my old Facebook profile pictures from around 2017. I found it odd, but went with it and left back a reaction in one of her photos from that same year, only to get yet another reaction from her only a couple minutes later. Before I knew it, we were talking. 

A week or two goes by in which we had been talking every day. For some reason we enjoyed each other's virtual company, and despite not having many common interests we ended up liking each other to the point that we physically met after so much time of not seeing each other. For this I have to explain that we live three hours away from each other by car, which is a considerable distance. 

Fast forward a month or two and we started a relationship. Everything was apparently perfect. Each time we were together it was all smiles and giggles, good sex, y'know, typical early relationship stuff. 

For the upcoming part I have to quickly explain something about myself. Before this whole issue which I'll develop on in the upcoming paragraphs, I didn't drink alcohol. Not because I didn't try it, but because I didn't like the effects it had on my body. Other traits I have is that I tend to overshare/overgive, so I was always showering her with attention and gifts whenever possible. This is not exclusive with love interests though, I also spoil my younger sister whenever possible. I've been in abusive relationships in the past and have a life philosophy of ""be the friend, the co-worker, the lover, the partner that you would like to have"". I do this for feeling good with myself, but as a byproduct of living this way people that interact with me tend to have a really good impression of me. 

On to the next part. A couple of months pass by, everything is relatively perfect, she had a couple of attitude issues like whenever she had a bad day at work she would take it out on me, among some other things that I decided to ignore because whenever I tried to bring up that she was being unreasonable she would get even more upset. She was also a drug addict and whenever she was way too high to the point of not even being able to realize that one plus one equals two I would simply just read Reddit or news on my phone and she would have a bad trip and believe I was being mean with her, among other things. Fast forward to her best friend's party, it was around mid-August 2020. In this particular party, one of the people that went brought an alcohol that I hadn't tried before, called 'mezcal'. I decided to try it and got really drunk, and I was having fun with her best friend's friends (all of them were male, we were playing Fifa in the living room which in my country is the best selling game each year). 

Eventually I don't know what crossed my mind, but I remembered the bad times I had with my at the time previous girlfriend, and start tripping pretty bad. Whenever I feel like that I call my best friend, since we know each other so well and know how to help the other out whenever he's not feeling well. I leave the house and walk to the front yard, not so far away but far away enough so that nobody can listen to my conversation. I call him and with drunk, broken language attempt to tell him what I was feeling, which he managed to understand perfectly. Who didn't understand it perfectly was my girlfriend at that time, who happened to be eavesdropping on my conversation since she thought it looked suspicious. She flipped out pretty terribly and thought I was referring to her, since I was telling my friend stuff like the emotional damage that I had suffered and that I didn't really have a good time with her (my at the time previous gf) but that I stayed with her for that long because she threatened me that she'd commit suicide if I left her. She thought I was referring to her, and drunk me attempted to explain to her that that wasn't the case. Then I did a 200 IQ play and told her to speak with the person with whom I was talking on the phone, my best friend, and that he'd explain everything to her. I gave her the phone and my best friend explained to her even the horrible abuse that I had suffered in the past, but she just wasn't having anything of it; she didn't believe one word and hung up on him. We then left the party and went back to her department (because we were in her city) and slept. 

The next morning I wake up and attempt to hug her but she was acting horribly towards me. That whole morning she had this look of disgust in her face which I just couldn't explain. At around 11 AM I was leaving for going back to my city by car, tried to hug her and she acted like if I wasn't even there. I left and couldn't understand what was going on. When I arrived home she sent me a message that it was too much for her, and that she wanted ""some time off"". I was reluctant but told her that if that would make her feel better I agree. The following days she would post on social media how I'd been an asshole all the time indirectly through sharing memes about that topic and was generally very mean towards my person without even talking to me. I asked her several times what's up with the stuff that she's sharing because it was truly hurting me and she just ghosted me. The only instance that she talked to me in those days was for asking me to send her a file of a class assignment that I did for her (because she's still in university and I helped her by doing around 40% of her homework and projects). During all this time my best friend was telling me to dump her, that she didn't deserve me and that I can get someone better literally anywhere, but I didn't listen. 

This hurtful attitude kept going for a full week. Around the 8th day I wake up to a message saying that she doesn't know if she truly wants to be with me, that she has to weigh her options. I broke up with her that same day in the night in a letter I wrote, which I scanned and sent to her so she could clearly read what I had wrote. In the letter I basically explained that her power trip showed me a side of her person that I really did not like, and if for a mistake (which wasn't really a mistake but at the time she gaslighted me into believing it was) I did she would act like that, I did not want to witness what an authentic problem would cause. I didn't want to see her reply, so shortly after sending the scanned letter I blocked her from everywhere, effectively breaking all contact with her. 

It all would've been great if it ended there, but it did not. A day later my mother called me saying that she (my at the time gf) contacted her and told her that if she could please tell me to unblock her so she could speak with me. She also begged my sister through Facebook Messenger to convince me to unblock her too. For some stupid reason I found this very endearing, and decided to unblock her to see what she had to say. She begged me to not break up with her and to ""give us a chance"", which basically meant to give her a chance in her gaslighting. I was stupid enough to say yes, so we carried on for two more months. 

Those two months were...ugh. To be honest, thinking back, I was the only one really trying. Whenever I suggested visiting her or telling her to come over to my place, she would make excuses (spoiler alert, after the party incident we didn't see each other again). From time to time whenever she noticed I was losing enthusiasm, she would write cute messages and attempt to be nicer than usual (which really wasn't that much) for what I believe was not losing me or something. During this time I bought her a TV (stupid me, I hate myself) because her TV was small and it wasn't even a Smart TV. I bring this up because when I bought it I said something like ""I can't wait to enjoy it with you"" and her response was a ""uh yeah"" in the dullest way possible. Looking back I acted quite dumb but okay let's move on. 

Fast forward to around early November, and one random day she tells me that she's having an emotional breakdown. I couldn't come over during those days because of work, but I strongly suggested to visit a psychologist, since this is something I always endorse. Mental health should be everyone's priority. She tells me that she'll go the next day. The next day arrives and all of a sudden I receive a WhatsApp message from her saying that we should break up. I was dumbfounded, and asked her why. Her explanation amounted to ""The psychologist told me that I didn't know how to be on my own, and that I had to learn how to scratch myself before being with someone else so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] up with you. I want to continue our relationship after I recover"". I was truly dumbfounded, it was truly the lamest excuse I could've ever coughed up, but I was on the receiving end. I then proceed to tell her to please be sincere with me, that if what she really wanted was someone she could see everyday (someone local, from her same town) then I would completely understand, because at that point it already had been several months that we don't see each other and seeing each other wasn't really that easy. She said that that wasn't the case. Basically we break up at this point. 

Not even a full day went by and she started posting stuff on social media that she's single and wants to live the single life (again, through sharing posts on Facebook directly implying what I'm [REDACTED_NAME]). Then she does what women do when they want other men's attention, put pictures of her in extremely revealing beachwear as her profile picture on each and every platform. For all this I had no way of knowing because after breaking up I unfriended her in every platform, which is something I do whenever I finish a relationship, formal and not formal; because I prefer to cut the people out of my life completely once it's over. Not even two full weeks later I was asked by some friends if ""someone stole my chick"", because they weren't even aware that we broke up and she was already with somebody else. What I thought that was the case, was the case. I felt like shit. I felt replaceable, expendable, worthless; more than ever before (well, before I never felt like that, to be honest). The negative thoughts ran rampant in my head the following weeks. My self worth plummeted so low that I even considered suicide, but fortunately my best friend was there to help me through the hard time, he missed days from his work to stay at my place and cheer me up. 

Fast forward to early February from the present year, I was feeling 100% recovered from that issue. All of a sudden, I get a message from a burner Instagram account saying it was her, and that if I could please unblock her because she wanted to speak with me. At this point I had already realized how terrible of a relationship it was and how bad her actions made me feel. I decide to unblock her because I wanted to see her mastery in eloquence once again, but this time knowing that I'm 100% sure that I wasn't going to fall again. She starts telling me that in all this ""alone time"" that she's had (she didn't realize that I knew she was with somene else) she fixed her mind and now wants to come back with me and continue our relationship. I then proceed to say no and for the sake of her closure decide to develop upon why I would never want to go back with her. She starts literally begging for the next couple days, and to be honest I was enjoying myself seeing how she was miserably trying to gaslight me into going back with her with zero chance of success. I have big fragments of that conversation in my phone's screenshots folder but they're in Spanish, I would gladly share them with you guys and even translate everything if the interest is high enough. 

Back to the topic, she gave up after a week later of trying. A couple of days later I was told by another friend that she went back with another of her ex boyfriends. I laughed and then appreciated that I opened my eyes in time. If she had done that going back thing in December or even early January I may have fallen for it. I had enough time to reflect so everything turned out alright.",4
hcta20,1592685277.0,2020-06-20 20:34:37,TrueOffMyChest,I was a victim.. and I only realized that 4 years later,"Really long story, so prepare for that.



I had an on/off boyfriend in high school. I was young, dumb, and severely depressed. I had no self-worth whatsoever and being with him made me feel like I was something you know? This was between ages 15-17. We started off as good friends, but during the relationship he would lie to me and be really vague about things. I pushed it off because yay I have a boyfriend who likes me when I absolutely hated myself, but I would always get warnings from other people about who he really was. I ignored them as they were his exes and I amounted it to jealousy at the time. 

Things were going alright, until he would always try to be sexual. I was never interested in anything like that as I was still a kid, and he wouldn't push it any further if I was uncomfortable. 

I was still a kid. This all occurring 15-17. He was a year older than me. 

As time went on, we were on/off because he would leave me for an ex, then leave that ex for another girl, then that girl for another girl etc. 

Couple years later when I was 17, I was friends with one of his exes. We always hung out all summer and she would tell me how he kind of expected things of her. He would try to push sensual things like making out with her ""it's okay, we're best friends though it's okay"" and told me how severely uncomfortable that made her. She said after he left she started crying. I went home and I just felt.. sick. I wasn't the only one he was trying to kind of push things on. It always made me feel really guilty for not being into anything  sexual. I started to feel even more worthless.. I couldn't offer anything and honestly that was made very clear. 

Fast forward to.. truthfully I don't know. I don't know ages anymore but I want to say I was 17 and him 18. Yeah. I was 17.


The summer after my Junior year.

We would hang out and he always wanted to be sexual while together and kinda pressured me into it. So I gave in because I thought that's what love was. No penetration just, feeling up. More on his end as I never really wanted to do this but I just wanted to keep him around because I thought I was in love.. 

Well, after one day he winds up changing his mind about us I guess and goes back to an ex days later. He gets her pregnant.. she's 14-15 at the time and him 18. 

Everyone pretty much hated him. Yet. I couldn't bring myself to. Even after everything he was doing to me I couldn't bring myself to hate him. I wanted to be that one person who didn't. 

This gets longer but I'll try to shorten it.

After my senior year and I was away at college, he and I were in contact again. He would tell me how stressful his relationship was and would always imply regretting having a child. I never knew what to say but I tried to be there for him. He then started to tell me that he loved me and wanted to be with me, that he regretted his decision to leave me. I was still in love, so. I put myself in this stupid decision of being his 'mistress' so to speak. He cheated on his girlfriend/mother of his child with me for MONTHS. This time I was 18 and it was sexual, I felt like it had to be to keep him. He was always assuring me he wanted to be with me and I believed him. Eventually we were found out, and I kept telling myself 'If I have to be the bad guy for him, so be it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with that. He loves me.' 

After I left that college and we were together.. it all changed.

Basically, the relationship went sour from there. 

After everything he told me, how he wanted to marry me, how he wanted us to be together forever while he was with her.. once he had me to himself, he treated me like shit. 

That relationship was always him lying to me, gaslighting me. He wanted her. He tried going back to her and would lie to me saying he wanted me. I didn't know what to do. I was so confused, so depressed, so heartbroken and still so in love. 

All I wanted was for him to tell me the truth. Did he ever love me? Why was he treating me like this when just months ago he wanted to marry me?

He would stalk her NSFW tumblr, still had nsfw pictures of her on his computer. It was clear. He was obsessed with her still. I was more heartbroken that he would lie to me than anything. 


As expected, that relationship ended. I don't remember that day. I used to. But my memory of that particular day is pretty much gone. I was 19? 20?


Months later I started talking to him again. More like, he came to me. Still wanting to keep me but needing it to be a secret because he went back to his ex/mother of his child. We did have sex again multiple times even though he was together again with her. It felt.. so wrong. But. Again. I did it because I wanted to keep him around.. I didnt care the relationship ended, I just wanted my best friend back.. but he stopped being that person long ago. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] one who broke that off. I knew it was a bad idea and knew he also didn't really love me. 



I ended up finding someone new. We've been together for nearly 4 years and are engaged. In the early stages of this relationship I was so scared and paranoid because of my past, but he was so gentle and loving with me. I learned what love really is and started to hate my ex for what he did to me. I held that hate for years, until recently. 

I thought I had forgiven him. We were all young and dumb and he did give me good memories. 


Then I started reading a lot of MeToo stories. And it all sounded.. familiar. 

Even though I always gave consent, I only did so because its what he had always wanted this entire time, because it's what would have kept him and because I felt pressure to.

I realized, why should I forgive him? When 1. He's never made any attempt to apologize 2. I was the victim. 

He lied to me, took advantage of me, used me, kept me around during his sick game when he didn't even know what he wanted. He kept me around because he was alone and I was the only one who didn't hate him. Or maybe because he'd known me for years he kept me around. What ever the reason, it was obvious he didn't love me. 


My name has been slandered because of what happened while I was away at college. Because he cheated even though i urged him to tell the truth for MONTHS because nobody deserves that. Yet I still did it anyway. 

My name has been slandered for being the bad guy. And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] denying that I was, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] denying what I did was wrong. 


But my side of the story has never been told.


After so many years I realized the truth, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME], so happy to finally get my story out. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] expecting anyone to really read this, I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Happy to get it out there",2
egxrpw,1577574331.0,2019-12-28 23:05:31,TrueOffMyChest,Childhood to Present: my story as a low income rape and child abuse survivor stuck in a never ending cycle of toxicity (extremely long),"I keep promising myself not to revisit my past and to focus on my future, but every time I feel hurt, I can’t forget all the things I’ve been through. Life is not fair regardless of how hard you try. I feel alone because nobody will accept me the way I am. Some people might say that the past is the past and we should move on, but the past is part of who we are in the present. I used to think that changing mentally as we grow up is objectively bad, but I no longer think that’s necessary try. We should never forget who we are, but we should always improve and remember where and who we were. Not everyone is the same and it’s sometimes hard to relate with people's beliefs or experiences. I remember a point in my life where I was very judgmental and criticizing change, but that was a trait that was fostered through the environment I grew up in. If I had one redeeming quality about me back in my early teens, it was that I always wanted to explore beyond the silence.

Before puberty, I was not allowed to leave the house, even to go to my relatives houses, which were on the same block. If I dared to leave and I was found, my mother would lock me inside the house and made sure to lock the kitchen and the roof’s entrance, since I got used to leaving through the kitchen window’s iron bars and climbing down the house from the roof, so I can leave. I wanted to be like the other kids. Granted most other kids had wealthier parents with a child who would show off what his parents got him, while I got diagnosed with low blood sugar, because I saved every penny to buy myself toys to make me feel like other kids, since my parents can’t afford anything other than breeding more kids into the world to abuse. Everything was punished by getting hit with whatever is close by, be it a vacuum pipe or a 2 by 4 that they found somewhere and the beating would sometimes not stop, until whatever weapon they’re using breaks. This part I got used to. I’ll get beaten until I lose my voice and fall asleep in my own tears.

I emphasized puberty earlier because that’s when we’re supposed to be innocent. We’re not thinking about what life is like as an adult, we’re thinking what fun can we have today. Which is what brings me to one of the biggest traumas I’ve encountered in life. I was raped many times as a child. The first time I was raped, I was around 6 or 7 at most. My father told me to go to the nearby grocery store to get a change and the owner insisted that I go with him to the back of the store if I wanted to get the change. I was too worried about the consequences of not getting the change and I didn’t understand what was going on to me at that time. I never spoke about it or mention it to anyone, because every rape comes with a threat. Similar incident happened to me after that, but I have a vague memory of them, except for one that I would never forget. When I was in 5th grade, I used to have a friend who I considered best friend. After we got out of school and went home, he stopped by my house and told me to come with him to meet someone who would lend us video games. Being the naive kid that I was I got excited and went with him to meet this person that he knows. His older brother was in the guy’s garage. The first thing I noticed was that the guy was much older than us. I don’t remember the conversation that we had there, but it ended with my friend and his brother leaving and the guy insisting that I stay. I didn’t want to stay and the guy pulled me inside of his house and into a bathroom where he locked me. I started crying and he started threatening me with violence if I don’t strip voluntarily, which I did after he threatened to kill me. After he was done raping me and threatening me I was in so much shock that I couldn’t say a word. My “friend” was outside and was wondering why I was crying. He told me to go tell my uncle if the guy have hurt me and I was still unable to speak. My uncle was in his garage and I don’t remember what I told him, but he went with his brother and grabbed the guy and brought him to their garage and started beating him, while at the same time screaming at me and threatening to beat me up as well if I don’t tell him exactly what he did. I couldn’t. I don’t think I even had the vocabulary to describe what happened. Next thing I knew, I was home and my uncle told my parents what happened. The straw that broke the camel’s back was when my father started blaming me for what happened and shouting at my face, while my mother told me to go take a shower. Nothing has hurt me as much as my father screaming at me and telling me that it’s my own fault. Not the rape itself and not being screamed at and threatened as I watch a person getting beating to near death. This incident changed my life drastically.

After the incident, I started doing horrible at school. The school that I had to pass by the rapist house to go to and from everyday. I used to be so popular because of my performance at school apparently, to the point that so many people I don’t recognize know who I am, but everything changed after that day. I didn’t want to stand out. I started setting at the back of the classroom and not caring about how I look. I used to be fit and was on the school’s team for soccer, but I stop doing all of that. I didn’t want to be noticed. I stopped talking to the “friend” who lured me to the predator. I don’t have proof that he knew what that guy was planning at the time, but I can’t shake the feeling that he did. There’s nobody trustworthy.

Many people wonder why do Saudi males not stand up for women in their communities. I think the answer is not as simple as some might think. When I was in middle school, my sister started going out with guys, which is normal in western countries, but is strictly forbidden in a place like Saudi Arabia. Even then, the guys she was going out with were older than her, and she was still a minor. I’m thinking the main reason she was going out with guys is because she wanted to break free from the poverty we were living in. She had way too many things that there’s no way my parents have bought her. At some point she was caught with one of the guys she was going out with and lots of drama with my parents happened. My siblings and I got the short end of it. Also, I somehow got blamed for it and was told that I’m not trustworthy, even though I didn’t know anything about what my sister's personal life. This all happened while I was at school, so I decided to skip school whenever I can and stay home. “At least let me be a witness of what’s going on if you're going to blame me for it” is what I thought at the time. Every detail about what happened is discussed in secret as it is with my family. Now, everyone who knows about my sister’s affair is looking down on us, as if her siblings were involved in any part of it. I was furious at the time and I just remember constantly arguing with my father about why I’m skipping school and him threatening to divorce my mother over it. I was beyond caring at that point. I barely passed the first year of high school and had to repeat the second year 3 times, because I’ve reached the bottom.

For Saudis to work before graduating high school is a thing that is frowned upon by parents. I knew my parents are not going to provide anything other than 1 meal a day that you have to be present for, so I insisted that I work part time, but my parents told me to get that thought out of my head and to focus on school. Since there’s no school during summer, I thought I could work over the summer so I can earn money to buy whatever I want. During summer, I started going to nearby local business and asking if they need any help. One grocery store agreed to hire me for about $80 a month, which was plenty to me at the time. Little did I know, that job didn’t last more than a week, because it’s just your typical predator. This time though, I went along with it. He promised that he would buy me whatever I’m trying to save for if I’d let him do me. I stalled him until he bought me a Playstation 2. Then, I bailed out of the agreement and never showed up to his store again. Comes next year with another job search and I ended up in a similar scenario, except this time, the guy wasn’t as straightforward as the previous guy and he was only dropping hints for a week before he gave up and fired me. With this incident, I gave up on summer jobs. My whole world view just got darker.

During high school, I had a friend who always got bullied and I had to step up and defend him. His story was also heart breaking. He was a shy quiet guy who was taken advantage of. According to what he told me, he was raped by one of the mosque staff his parents forced him to go to (I guess this is not exclusive to priests). He was also raped by his cousin and his father. What pissed him off the most was that his father would constantly rape his older sister. The only reason he stopped was because the daughter got married and left the house. This guy was probably the most religious guy I knew. We shared all of our secrets and stories. We discussed our worldview and religion. He was at a state were he thought everyone was like his father. I think I was a positive influence on him. He became more confident and I became even more depressed with all of what I experienced up until that point. We had a crappy desktop that all members of the family shared. When nobody was around, I would go into an app called Paltalk to listen to debates between Sunnis and Shia, since that topic is considered very controversial to even mention in public and you can get arrested for it. I thought I would find the uncensored truth, but the censored one was just enough.

I don’t want to dive into religious debate specific topics. However, everything boils down to lots of circular logic and believing that something is true because you believe in something else completely unrelated. Nobody talks about how to think in school and critical thinking is another taboo topic at the time, so it’s all about memorizing. There were lots of bizarre things about Islam that stood out to me during those debates, such as something called “religious trick” or in basic terms “how to cheat god 101.” The most modern example of this is people driving a specific distance during Ramadan to break their fasting without sinning. An ugly old example is owning your close relatives as slaves/maids to be able to have sex with them. All of those topics were discussed during debates except one topic that nobody wanted to touch with a ten-foot pole, which was atheism.

At the time, I had conflicting ideas about religion. It was not something you can discuss with anyone. Scratch that, it’s not something you discuss, unless you’re handing your own execution pass. Instant messaging through MSN was very popular at the time and I used to talk with friends from different countries through it. I knew a girl from the UAE who had similar ideas as I did, but she had bigger balls than I did to even introduce the topic of religion. We discussed and debated many things and became very close. She introduced me to atheist resources and books to read, which I was excited to do. At first I felt into depression and fear. After being convinced that everything I believed during my entire life was the ground truth, I now have a completely different word view. I cried for about a week, because I knew this was a point of no return. Maybe this is why nobody in the Paltalk religious debates wanted to even touch the topic, but this felt natural to me. Everything made more sense than it ever did. The cost? Everything.

I used to read many books on a Kindle that I bought to read “illegal books.” I wanted to know more. I didn’t want to be the person who followed the beliefs he was born into. I wanted to re-examine issues I was stubborn about, such as homosexuality. For the longest time, I associated it with rape, because of my narrow world view, but I’ve overcame this now that I don’t hold a belief that influences my judgment and my world view. However, this just made blending in more difficult. A muslim society is like an echo chamber; you’re either with us or against us. I remember making a remark during a family lunch which made my dad question my religious allegiance “did you become a Sunni now!?.” Little did he know, that I became an atheist. The problem was that this was my secret. The only person who knew about me was the girl from the UAE. However, I stopped talking to her after she constantly called me derogatory terms and refused to stop. Now, I’m alone again. One of my IRL friends was running an errand and wanted me to come along with him. So I grabbed my Kindle and went with him. He was curious what I was reading and I told him you don’t want to know, but he insisted that he wanted to know. After about 2 hours, we finished the errand and we’re driving back to my place. I finally told him what I was reading and I told him it’s a book about atheism. He asked “does this mean that you don’t belief in the Quran?” I answered “No.” His reaction? He reached for the passenger door to open my door, kicked me off with his foot, closed the door and drove away. This was my open minded friend.

After I’ve finally graduated high school, I attended one of the top universities for one semester before I dropped out. Why? Because my dad decided to take the car he gave me to get to school and I had no way of going there, since there are no public transportation. The following year, I’ve given up the educational route, even through I always dreamed of getting a bachelor of science. The only person with a BSc in my family was one of my uncles, who had a mechanical engineering degree from the same university I was attending. Right now, I just wanted to make money to support myself. I’m broke and depressed. Therefore, I’ve applied to the oil company during the following year. I was offered a special scholarship program, instead of the typical 1-2 years of in company training before getting hired where needed. I was excited about the idea of going to the US to study. I’ll finally leave this dumpster to see the world. The catch? The scholarship was for a diploma in emergency services and it starts after doing training for 6 months and taking the IELTS test. Also, we only had about an hour to decide if we wanted to join this special program. I didn’t want to be an EMT, but I wanted to go to the US, so I signed the contract.

After we’ve finished the training and the IELTS exam, everyone had to apply for a student visa to study in the US. I was the first to apply, but the last to get my visa. I’ve applied to my visa around March, yet I only got mine during December. Everyone went there and finished 2 semesters, while I was being told that my scholarship will be canceled and that I’ll be offered the regular program. I was depressed and I lost all hope by December, until I was contacted by the company to tell me that I’m flying in 2 weeks to catch the spring semester. I was very excited. I arrived in the US, the next day I took a placement exam and got my class schedule. In less than a week, the semester starts.

The first semester was not bad, because all I had was general education classes. During summer, I had to start taking pre-major classes. I was feeling alone and I missed spending time with the friends I used to hang out with before traveling, so I decided to take all of the summer classes the company enrolled me in in the first half. After I’ve finished the semester, I went home and I regretted it. I didn’t want to travel again, because I felt isolated. To top it off, the first day I arrived, the landlord wanted to see me. So I went to talk to him and he said that I missed half of my summer rent. I told him that I spoke with his wife who said that I don’t need to pay the summer rent, since I’m on a 1-year contract, so he called her and she denied any of that. I felt very angry and upset. On top of that, my housemates who happened to be other students in the program decided to let a stranger use my room while I was gone and trash my room. I couldn’t let this go and I just wanted to leave the place. On top of that, the company sent a supervisor to search our rooms for drugs and alcohol, even though we’re not on a company property. I felt like I just changed my Saudi cage to a newer one. I didn’t feel like I had any agency over any decision. Beside the casual racism, you don’t make your schedule and you’re still following the company policy, which was basically the Saudi Government policy. Also I stopped attending one of my classes and company noticed that my grade was going down the toilet, so they told me I either attend the class or I’ll have to go back to Saudi Arabia, because I’m dropping below 12 credits, which is the requirement to maintain a valid visa status. I’ve tried seeking help from the school, but I was repeatedly told “if you were American I can...” Finally, By Thanksgiving I was depressed and was giving meds that just made me feel drowsy before the company decided to send me back. At this point, I was very disappointed with myself.

I forgot what it feels like to be happy. I knew what I wanted, but I also knew that I can’t have it. I wanted to have some control over the decisions that affect my life. I don’t want my background to decide my future. I wanted to follow a path that I feel comfortable taking, instead of going with the flow. However, I knew that if I made a move now, it will all just collapsed on me again. I needed time to recover. If I can’t recover, then there’s nothing more to live for. In my family's eyes, I’m just a failure who will not amount to anything. All of this time, I wanted to help my family financially, it didn’t feel like I was even living for myself, but for other people. I didn’t want my younger brother to go through what I went through when I was his age, so I made sure to buy him things whenever I was able to, so did my older sister, that is until he became entitled and started asking for things like a car, so we had to take a step back.

While I was home, the company was “studying” my situation. I knew I was done for, but at the same time, I didn’t know what options I have. The car my father took away is now my younger brother’s car, while my father is enjoying his new car, so unless transportation is part of the opportunity, I can’t take it. I have nothing but depression. Come January, the company sends me a termination email. I never told my parents about it, so my father decided to drive down to the company with me to ask if they’ve reached a decision. They told him that I was terminated and I can tell that he was angry with me, because I’m back to being a liability, even though he didn’t spend a dime on me since I graduated high school beside a miserably school lunch allowance. They told him that I can apply to the regular program in 3 months. I knew this was a lie, because their online application will refuse to even let me submit my application due to my age passing the threshold they’ve set if nothing else. What about other universities? Unless you’re fresh out of high school, you can forget about getting admitted and it has been 3 years since I graduated.

I was depressed and filled with the thought of taking my own life. There’s nothing to live for and nothing will ever change for me. I had some money saved in my bank account that I decided to live on. Once I’m all out and nothing has changed, that’s when I’ll do it, because I refuse to ask for money, especially not from my father.

I spent the next 3 years living in an addendum my parents where using as a storage space. Most of my social interaction with other people was through online video games. Mostly a game called FFXIV, where I was talking with people every night while doing raids. I just wanted to forget real life and live in a world where I make my own decisions. This was the next chapter of my life.

While waste my life away playing the game, I met many interesting people. Mainly the woman who was our raid leader. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that such a character exists. She had at least 3 women chase after her, while she only felt related to an imaginary character she keeps writing fan fiction about. I mean, at that point, I wasn’t sure if I knew what’s real and what’s not, but I didn’t agree with the way she was treating the women who were after her. She felt threatened when I started spending more time with one of the girls that used to chase her. She constantly caused drama in any possible way to separate us. Eventually, she decided to temporarily stop playing the game, because we didn’t let her continue her manipulation.

As time passed by, I figured the girl I was spending time with isn’t perfect. Everyone has their flows, including me. This girl’s flow was that she animated her anger and it didn’t take much to make her angry. You’re either with her or against her. There’s no neutral ground or mistakes. I told her that she needs to manage her anger and she said she’ll try to do so. Regardless of her flows, I wanted to meet her IRL after knowing her for 3 years and speaking with her on an almost daily basis. That’s when I decided to get my life together and to try and make this happen.

The girl I wanted to see lived in Canada, even though she was studying in the US. I decided to try and get a sponsorship to study in Canada, since it’s slightly cheaper there. I’ve applied for a Canadian study visa twice, but I got rejected both times. After that, I decided to get a study visa in the US, which I received in less than a week. Since I’m not fresh out of high school and I needed sponsorship; otherwise, there’s no way I can pay an out-of-state tuition, I had to go through a chaotic process to get accepted as a self sponsored student at first, which got delayed for half a year. I finally got accepted in November as a self sponsored student and now have a chance to get sponsored once I start my studies. Because of the delays, I postponed my travel date to January, because I didn’t want to waste money doing nothing over winter break, especially since I’m running on almost no budget.

As January have started, I arrive at the US. First thing I try to do is to process with my self sponsorship application, since the next step requires a scan of my visa with an entrance stamp. I was scared shitless when I couldn’t access my application to follow with it. I spent the next weeks trying to reach anyone through phone or emails to ask about what’s going on. Finally, a single person answers one of the emails I sent to tell me that they have a 60 days expiration on application, which is a new policy that I didn’t sign on or had any way shape or form to know about even after I received the email. I’m already in the US, I can’t just leave and come back. That’s now how it works. Also, if I’m going back, I’ll have to start this process all over again. As a cheap option, I thought I’d get sponsorship while studying language, but now, it’s just a money sink. I told the girl I wanted to meet about my situation and she decided to help me. I told her that she’s not obligated to help, but I appreciate it very much. She signed me up for a TOEFL exam (yet another standard language test that expires in a few years), which I’m supposed to take in a month, so I can start applying to one of the top 100 universities in the US. While I graduated from the language program and got a qualifying TOEFL score to get me into any of the top 100 universities, I had a big problem to deal with. Remember my last semester in the EMT program? Yeah, all of my grades for that semester where F’s with one W. The messed up thing is that one of the F’s was the class I stopped attending, so have I not been sent home, I would have been fine visa status wise. Anyway, because of that semester, no university in that list will admit me. Also, by the time I finished the English program, I didn’t have money to wash my clothes, so the only option I had was to go to a community college.

I asked my parents to loan me money for the summer semester, because if I can get the scholarship, I will be reimbursed for all the tuition I paid. I got slightly less than the money I needed for the summer semester (in-state tuition). I got accepted into a community college in the same city as the girl I wanted to see and she offered to help me, until I can get the scholarship. I was very happy to finally meet her in person. During the same week, her mother knew that she was meeting with me and she was understandably concerned, so she also came to visit us. Little did I know that I was the one who should have been concerned.

My relationship with my parents at this point hardly exists. They were manipulative and just wanted their children to be old enough to work, so they can guilt trip them into giving them money. They were milking my younger brother, older sister and her husband for money that they claim was for me, but I didn’t see a penny other than summer tuition money, which they stole from my sister to buy a new car. They didn’t care what kind of job you worked or whether or not you’re happy, so long as they can brag about how all of their children have jobs and are married, because to them, that’s fulfilling their role, even if they didn’t contribute to it. I want to find nice things about them, but there is nothing from my perspective. I even asked my brother in-law once if he had something nice to say and he just laughed.

I wanted this to work. I want to take control over my life and to finally be able to make my own decisions. Everyone thinks that I’ll fail, but I’ll prove them wrong is what I said to myself.

I finally met the person I was chatting with for over 3 years. I was excited, but it didn’t feel like she was as excited as I was. We drove into her apartment and I was greeted with a lecture about the rules. “Fair enough. It’s your place after all.” So I took a shower and wore the slippers whenever I came in to the apartment, I’m not used to wearing any footwear inside the house, other than bathroom slippers. Also, I wasn’t used to keeping my inside clothes inside the apartment and anything else for outside and away from anything else. Also, wiping everything you bring from the outside or anything that went outside for that matter. I felt like a germaphobe, but I had to respect her rules no matter how absurd I thought they were. Normally, you can’t break habits you held for decades overnight, so I’d occasionally make mistakes and that’s when she’ll lash out on me like I’ve just sold drugs to children.

Her mother arrives and we go to pick her up from the airport. Her first impression of me was not good. The mother and her daughter will start talking in Mandarin, so I wouldn’t know what they were saying. Sometimes the mother will turn around to me and start speaking to me in Mandarin, until her daughter reminds her that I don’t speak Mandrain. Then come the questions “do your parents know that my daughter is helping you?” I said “Yes.” Then, she followed “and how are they feeling about it?” I answered “I don’t know.” She continued, “are they okay with a stranger taking care of their son?” I answered “I don’t know. I don’t think they care.” It also happened that the week she was visiting was my birthday and she gave me a birthday card with “I don’t know you, so I didn’t write anything.” inside of it. I never felt so little. I was ready to grab all of my stuff and leave if I had the money for a ticket. Also, during the morning I was having breakfast as I was watching a YouTube video and I got criticized by the mother for doing that. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone nor do I want to be humiliated, because I’m self aware of my situation.

I was asked to take 17-18 credit over the summer by the daughter, to find a part time job, to clean the house and make dinner, since I’m not paying rent. I told her that might be a bit overkill to me, but I’ll try my best. So, I’ve enrolled in 5 classes, with 1 of them being a 1-in-2 class. I’ve applied to on campus jobs, since that’s the only kind of job I can legally do. I was never under as much pressure to succeed as I was during that summer. I was studying multiple new topics that I’ve never explored before and I had enough homework to cramp my hands as I’m working on it. She wanted me to clean the apartment and dust every inch of it every day and make dinner. If I missed a spot and she swiped and find dust, she will scream at me. If anything went wrong with the dinner she will scream at me. This kept going throughout the semester. I was breaking apart. I felt more at ease at college than I did at home. I was so stressed that the idea that I have to go back to the apartment made me want to cry.

I felt confused. I thought we were friends. Who treats their friends like this? I used to call my parents to vent my frustration, but their reply just confirmed my suspicions... “You’re exaggerating. This is normal” and “Maybe you’re doing something wrong.” I’m not perfect. I never pretended to be perfect, but what could it be that could make me personally lash out on someone the way she does with me? Does helping someone financially entitle them to treat others like slaves? I don’t understand.

Once the summer semester was over, I made it to the dean’s list. I felt proud of my accomplishment. It was my first proof that I’m trying my best and not slacking around. I wanted this to work. I asked my parents if they can help me financially with any amount they can for just one more semester. Then, I can go back home over winter break to start the application for the scholarship. All I needed was to get an admission letter from the university in the city, which was on the list. However, my parents didn’t think I was investment worthy, so they kept on stalling me with no intention of helping, since there was someone who was offering me help already. The daughter volunteered to help me again with the fall’s tuition, so I asked my parents if they can at least get me a ticket, because that’s the absolute minimum that I need to have a chance at a scholarship. Again, they stalled and said that they can only offer a one-way ticket. At that point, I’ve cut them off my life completely. I’m just a liability in their eyes and I’m just taking from their private luxurious life. Every time I’d call them to vent, I just feel worse. I tell them that I’m being both physically and emotionally abused, but they think I’m exaggerating. I had so many emotional and mental breakdowns during that fall semester, yet I somehow made it to the dean’s list again.

The girl I wanted to meet (now dubbed my girlfriend), have relaxed the rules a bit and asked me to clean during the weekends. My world is comprised of only the two of us. I have nobody to vent to or turn to. I’ve given up fighting the abuse. I’ll just try to do my best. Maybe she’ll come around. I feel like shit, but hey “life isn’t fair.” I always tell myself that no matter what happens, she offered to help me when everybody has abandoned me. I promised her that I will never abandon her. Not if I have a choice. I told her that I can’t force myself on her or her family. “If you want me to leave, just tell me and I will no longer be your problem.” Nobody is obligated to help me. Just like nobody is obligated to adopt an orphan or a pet. Regardless, it will be the most arrogant act to deny that our success came from “a small loan of a million dollars.” The debt that I have can’t be repaid. Any success that I achieve wouldn’t have happened without someone making a sacrifice and giving me the benefit of the doubt. For that, I’m forever grateful. It made me believe that people deserve second chances. It made me wonder how many people are in the same shoes as I am. It made me question people who are only concerned about their friends and family.

Another year passes with my world only containing my girlfriend and I. I’m now studying at the university with a part time job. I received a random call from a Saudi country code. It was my brother in-law. I was surprised that someone made the minimum effort to reach me, because they’ve tried none. They assumed I was dead, but maybe that’s what they want. I spoke with my brother in-law and I’ve explained to him the reason why I’ve cut off my parents from my life. He told me about what my siblings think of me after my parents made it sound like they kept sending me money and I simply ignored them for no reason. Also, he was the one who told me about all the money my parents were taking under the claim that it was for me. I told him I can prove everything by showing him all of my bank statements during that period. Everyone keeps exaggerating their problem in that culture that it’s hard to know what to believe and what not to. I had to go back home to renew my passport during that year. I confronted my parents who kept going with their lies, until I handed them proof that they’re the ones exaggerating and lying to everyone. However, in their culture, you’re wrong even if you’re right if it means making your parents wrong. I don’t buy into that and they’ll never be able to pressure me into it. I hate their guts.

The following semester, my girlfriend who was attending the same university with me have graduated and started working. I kept applying for jobs, but I never get passed the application form, even though I think I’m more than qualify for most of the jobs I’ve applied to. The problem is that nobody wants to hire foreigners. As soon as they know that I’ll need sponsorship at some point, they cancel whatever interview they had scheduled. One company didn’t even send me a notice of the interview being canceled and I waited 30 minutes passed the interview time waiting for a call, until I emailed asking about the situation and I got the most passive aggressive respond to a reasonable question. I’ve done better at my relevant part time job than all the students before me according to my mentor, yet, I’m not having any luck. At one of the many job fairs that I attended, I was asked if I had any personal projects to show. At the time I had none, because between juggling a full-time student status with all major classes and my part time job, I have no time to spare working on side projects. However, I made sure that the for the next job fair, I had a personal project, which I’ve worked on all summer, which even a 30 minutes talk is not enough to cover all of it. My resume that didn’t include this project was impressive according to other senior students who’ve reviewed it. Yet, I’m struggling to get a chance with any of the companies I’ve applied to, even though I’ve never felt as confident in myself as I do today. I feel very frustrated.

I’ve just finished my second to last semester. Finance is always an issue. I’ve applied for a loan and only managed to get 2k out of the 15.6k that I need for my last semester. I’m at a cross road again. My girlfriend has been distancing herself from me and always talking in a very passive aggressive way. During all of the years together, I’ve never harmed her in any way shape or form. I try to start conversations with her, but she shuts down any poor attempt at starting a conversation with her. She received a big package and I asked out of curiosity “what is that?” and she replies “THINGS!” I don’t know how or what to feel. She has completely shut down with me. Sometimes I wonder how she would feel if I just disappeared from her life. Would that make her happy? Am I keeping her from being happy? Does she realize how the way she acts affects me? She has been regulating what I can and can’t do for all the years we’ve been together. She criticized me for buying a $5 drink that I’m portioning over 2 days and only buy at most once a week. Am I not entitled to anything anymore? I’m back to eating one meal a day and that’s just instant noodles. She stopped buying food for [REDACTED_ADDRESS]arted buying only food that she eats. Whenever I’m buying food I’d always ask her if she wanted anything, because I don’t want to be the only one eating. I feel bad for eating anything without inviting her. I can’t read her mind and she doesn't want to communicate with me. I knew that she wanted a VR, but she said she was short on money. I told myself that that was the first thing I want to get once I get a full-time job, because she sacrificed so much for me. I later found out that the “THINGS” she got was the VR and some expensive anime figures, yet a $5 drink is too much. Why did she feel the need to hide them from me? She knows I would not judge her and if she asked my, I would tell her to not let me stop her from enjoying whatever she likes. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to disappear let her be. She looks happier when I’m not around her try to start a conversation knowing that I’ll only hurt myself in the process. She spends more time after work talking to random co-workers than she does with me in a week.

I know there’s no perfect relationship, but I don’t think it’s too much to ask for someone who you can talk to without constantly getting hurt. Everyone gets a bad day, but a bad day doesn’t justify harming your partner. After all, are they not supposed to be there for you during the good and the bad times? I don’t want to feel like going home is like going to a prison. I want home to be the place I can’t wait to go back to every day. The place where I can truly be me and not a shell of myself who's too afraid to slip and get punished for. I sometimes wonder how would she feel if the situation was reversed. How would I feel if I were in her shoes. Would I be treating her the same way she’s treating me? I can’t imagine any scenario where I’m shouting at her or being passive aggressive. I would treat her with love and respect. I wouldn’t treat her like I own her. I wouldn’t treat her like an object that doesn’t feel or have any needs. Living in constant fear is what I wanted to run away from and not what I wanted to live in.

I feel isolated. I don’t know where to go from here. I feel like I’m in a dark place. The only person in my world is me. I hate feeling like a burden, but I’m working towards not being a burden to anyone and I’m almost there, but I can’t see the path anymore. How is anyone in my situation supposed to succeed? I spent one of the only 2 days off I have between fall and spring cleaning the apartment (Christmas) and eating noodles. Now, I’m alone, while my girlfriend is visiting her family out of country. She left as if she was leaving to grab the mail from the mailbox. I’m feeling depressed, but I have nobody to talk to. I just want to get my story off my chest. Maybe I’ll feel better after I type it.

If you made it through to the end, congrats. This is about 1k short of the characters limit on Reddit. I just want someone in my life who could give me a hug and tell me that everything will be okay right now, because I don’t know where I’ll be in a few weeks.",16
9oomp7,1539703508.0,2018-10-16 15:25:08,TrueOffMyChest,"I sexually assaulted another kid when I was younger, and the guilt is killing me.","20 year old female here.

I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but as a child, much of it went untreated/not treated well enough. also had ADHD (but I think I grew out of it). as a result of these things, I think I was a bit off socially. I did always have friends, but I struggled. I know that things got worse for me in 4th/5th grade. I would scream and fight with my parents to a worrisome degree, I was super hyper at school (like, it was hard for me to NOT be hyper) and I was weird. like, really weird. I had a super perverted sense of humor. looking back on it, it was probably just my age. but I let it escalate in a way that I am [REDACTED_NAME] ashamed of to this day.

I was in 5th grade, and there were these 6th graders on my bus. a group of boys and girls. as a result of my outgoing but super annoying personality, I started talking to them, and very quickly started teasing them. mostly the boys. I really don't remember what I said to them, but I know it was gross sexual stuff. other kids, including my best friend at the time, thought it was hilarious for a while and egged it on. the boys seemed to think so too. In all honesty, what I was doing didn't seem wrong. I lacked a ton of impulse control and didn't really think about what I was doing, I just thought I was funny and enjoyed being the center of attention. eventually, however, it got waaay out of hand. I honestly forget most of the details, but I know that I groped a boy on a couple of occasions. again, I didn't really give any thought to what I was doing. I grew up in a loving household, and was taught that its wrong to touch people inappropriately, but for some reason, that common sense knowledge didn't kick in at all here. it was all impulse. I was honestly out of control. the instant gratification of attention - good or bad - seemed to be all that my mind was concerned with.

this probably went on for a few weeks until the principal stepped in. she told me that she ""heard through the grapevine"" that there had been stuff going on on the bus, specifically that I had been ""grabbing parts"". all of a sudden I felt the weight of my actions crash down on me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure I denied a lot of it out of utter fear that I had just ruined my life (selfish, I know, but I was a kid and panicked), but she called me into her office a second time and I confessed to saying some inappropriate things to a girl who I sat with one day. our principal was a really nice lady and basically just explained to me that my actions were making people uncomfortable and that I should do something else on the bus. I agreed and felt really good afterwards because I didn't really get in trouble, but at the same time I also felt super remorseful. it was like all my sense had just been knocked into me. my dad apparently received a phone call in which the principal detailed my interactions with this girl (I repeatedly asked her to kiss me as a joke which was obviously....a really bad move) and he asked me about it and I guess just reaffirmed what the principal said. nobody ever followed up with the part about me groping a boy. and I didn't apologize to the kids, either. I just kept my distance because I knew that's what I was supposed to do. 

it's been nearly ten years since then and I think about it all the time. I have so many questions about why I wasn't disciplined appropriately, but that's not my biggest concern. what fucks me up is that I literally sexually harassed multiple people and sexually assaulted one or two (I can't remember and I hate that). THAT is awful, and to me, unforgivable in a lot of ways. I've read a lot of stuff about kids assaulting other kids and that the kids who do it usually have a history of abuse, but that wasn't the case with me. as I said, I grew up in a normal, loving family. I wonder all the time WHY I did it. obviously I was so off-the-walls hyper that I wasn't thinking about my actions, but why was that? I was in so many ways a really nice, sensitive kid who loved animals and crafts, and was, for the most part, normal. yes, a little weird and definitely way too hyper at times as I stated before. but I wasn't a ""problem"" kid. this was an isolated incident. 

(side note: since then, i've been treated thoroughly for both anxiety and ADHD, both of which really disabled me during my childhood. around 7th or 8th grade, I was finally on track (though very far away) to becoming the person I wanted to be.)

but yeah, the guilt just fucks me up. especially because the summer after my senior year of high school I was sexually assaulted by someone I considered my friend, and it really damaged me emotionally to the point in which I was diagnosed with PTSD. the symptoms are mostly gone now and I don't give it much thought, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] worried that I fucked someone up in a similar way by touching them inappropriately. what if this kid - or kids, might have been one other boy - think about it constantly? what if they're in therapy for it? how can I just live with myself not knowing if I've ruined another person's life? there is no amount of shame and guilt greater than that which I feel towards my actions on the bus in 5th grade. 

I'd like to think of myself as a good person. I work with kids all the time, I really care about animals and the environment,
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] activist for multiple causes, i'm a good student, I have friends. I have a wonderful boyfriend which I'd like to think is a reflection of who I am [REDACTED_NAME] a person. I hope my future career consists of helping other people and nothing less. but I always question whether or not these things matter when I sexually assaulted someone. I know it was a long time ago, but as a victim of sexual assault myself, I know how how seriously impactful assault can be on a person. no matter how ""normal"" I may be today, this is still something that I did. was I an entirely different person at the time? yes, 100 percent. but that doesn't change the fact that I did it. 

there are multiple reasons why I don't want to find this one kid on facebook and apologize to him, the first and foremost being that I don't want him to all of a sudden realize that he has repressed childhood trauma and then fall into a spiral of depression and anxiety because of it. so that's not an option. 

I feel like i'm [REDACTED_NAME] this secret life. to my knowledge, basically nobody but the kids on my bus know that I did this, and they're all gone now doing their own things in the semi-adult world. my parents don't know, my boyfriend doesn't know, my friends don't know, nobody knows. I look at my friends and feel so ashamed because I know that they didn't do anything like that when they were children, and I feel like some weird sick freak trying to blend in with other ""normal"" people my age. 

my question is, what CAN I do to relieve myself of this guilt? is there anything? It may sound selfish, but quite frankly, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of obsessing over it to the point in which I feel suicidal. my depression and anxiety have been really bad lately and this is largely part of it. I know I need to talk to a therapist about it, and I definitely will once I muster up the courage. I have my first appointment with a new therapist on Friday. but until then, I figured venting to Reddit might help me feel better. this is the first time I've ever opened up about what happened. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if there are holes in my story, I've tried to be thorough while leaving out unimportant details. I just really need to find some support, somehow. these feelings of extreme remorse are probably unproductive and only making things worse.

TL;DR: I touched another kid's private parts when I was 10 or 11 and ten years later I'm [REDACTED_NAME] debilitating anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts from the guilt. ",0
1ltk6p3,1751859713.0,2025-07-07 03:41:53,TrueOffMyChest,My first time was with a married man,"I commented my story on another post but I decided to just make my own post. This is not something I have told people in my real life about so here it goes …

When I was 17 I formed a friendship with a 34yo married man with kids. I’m not gonna say how because it’s a very specific situation and it’s be too obvious who I am (this isn’t my main account). We would see each other sometimes and he was very helpful when I was getting ready for college and needed rides to work. Obviously my parents had no idea.

I turned 18 right before my high school graduation, and suddenly he confessed his feelings for me. He would tell me that he had to stay married for his kids, but he didn’t really love her and that he only loved me. I ate it up. After our first time having sex he told me he was proud of me for doing a good job. He also liked to bring me around his friends, to “show off” he would tell me to wear certain clothes, and I’m not gonna lie it made me feel sexy and wanted. We continued our relationship through the summer. We would have certain times we were allowed to text, we’d go somewhere to hangout and get food and then go to a motel to have sex. He would tell me that what we had was true love, that he wished things could’ve been different for us and all that good stuff.

I remember being in bed with him after having sex and cuddling when his wife called. He answered and talked to her like nothing was going on at all, asked to speak to the kids and then told her he loved her and hung up and we had sex again. This was something that has stuck with me for the rest of my life, how easily someone could lie and feel nothing. At the time hearing their voices I felt awful, but he would always wipe my tears away and tell me that it wasn’t our fault we were in love.

Eventually I started going to college and got more busy with midterms and finals; and by winter break I had ended things. There wasn’t any kind of big fight or anything, I just think I woke up one morning and I knew that this wasn’t real. He was more annoyed than anything and made me swear never to contact him or his family. He actually threatened me at one point - he kept texting me after I ended things and it would go from a casual ‘how are you’ to ‘you better never contact me or my family’.

The biggest kicker, when I went to him and told him I couldn’t do this anymore and he realized I was serious, he told me - he hopes that this wouldn’t make me go crazy or become a girl who has a lot of casual sex. Like what.

Anyways, this is something I don’t tell people. I don’t want to be judged for being an affair partner, but it felt good to write.",24
1hou4nt,1735471461.0,2024-12-29 11:24:21,TrueOffMyChest,I Often Mourn the Life I Could've Had if My Parents Weren't Horrible,"This is going to be a very long, depressing story. It's just something I'd like to ""get off my chest,"" as this subreddit invites.

I remember when I was 9 years old, my parents were driving me home from a baseball game and I said I didn't want to do baseball anymore because I hated it. I never liked it, and they just forced me to do it. They asked me, ""well what about basketball? Or football?"" and I said I didn't want to do those either. They then turned around and yelled, ""well then what are you gonna' do with your life??! You have to do SOMETHING!""

It was pretty much unfathomable to them that I, a boy, could be interested in anything other than sports. I wanted to do art, or theatre, or maybe dance, but they wouldn't let me because ""that's for girls. Sports are for boys."" So then I was pressured into continuing to do sports that I absolutely hated, for years. I dreaded every single day of practice. And I had to do these various sports that I hated every season of every year--Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer. When I was finally old enough to stand up for myself (at 17 years old, captain of multiple high school sports teams), I told them that enough was enough, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] doing this anymore. 

It took years of being miserable and dreading every single day that I had practice, developing severe depression, and years of having to go to therapy before they finally realized that they shouldn't (and frankly couldn't) keep pressuring me to do things that I hated. 

And this did not stop at sports. Forcing me to do things that I absolutely hated was a lot of what I can remember of my parents during my childhood. My father has Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and my mother is his co-dependent enabler. So everything was always about him and his needs and wants. He wanted me to be a straight boy when I just wasn't. So he did everything he could to prevent me from doing anything that he deemed ""gay"" or ""too girly"". I couldn't wear any colors other than blue, black, gray, or white. Nothing too flamboyant or colorful, nothing too bright for his liking. I couldn't wear Converse shoes because those were ""too girly"" even though all the kids in my grade back then (boys and girls) were wearing them. I couldn't play the instruments I wanted to, couldn't learn music, or sing, dance, paint, draw, or do theatre, etc. because those were all too girly for his liking. It was stifling, and all I can remember of all the years of my childhood revolves around him and his needs and wants, all the things he'd force me to do that I didn't want to do, all the things he'd prevent me from doing that I had always longed for. All the ways in which he would suffocate me--it's all I can remember out of each and every year that I lived with my parents.

I remember when I was 10 years old, I went to a dance recital with my parents to watch my younger sister (2 years younger than me) perform the routines her dance team had been rehearsing for months. I watched as the giant curtains parted and revealed my sister and her dance team on stage, in full uniform, poised, ready to do what they had practiced. They did so well with the first routine, and the crowd erupted in applause. I continued watching while I cried silently, wishing I too could be on a stage, performing and hearing a crowd's applause, but knowing my parents would never allow me to. 

When I was 11, my older sister had moved to college and I was the next oldest, so my father, who used to use my older sister as the scapegoat, moved down the line to me. I became the new scapegoat who was blamed for everything, and the only time I had any value in my parents' eyes was when I made my father proud or made him look good by doing well in academics, sports, or Boy Scouts, out in society, etc. I was in charge of cleaning the house, taking care of the dogs, doing all dishes, setting and clearing the table for breakfast and dinner, doing all of the yard work, and usually cooking and laundry as well. If I didn't do an excellent job at any of these things--I left a smudge on the bathroom shower wall, I missed a spot of dog poop in the backyard, I didn't clean a dish thoroughly enough, I overcooked something, etc.--I was brought to wherever I made a mistake, and had my face shoved in it. I was then reprimanded for how lazy I was and how I did a horrible job, and after being scolded and shamed until my father was satisfied, I was left in silence and told to think about this for next time. Then I was forced to apologize to him, every time. ""And what did you do wrong? What are you going to do to make sure that never happens again? Do you know how unhappy I am [REDACTED_NAME] you? You need to start making yourself useful and stop making so many mistakes."" I had to be perfect. All A's, the best on my sports team, always getting recognition in Boy Scouts, always perfectly doing all of the chores at home. Both of my parents worked beyond full-time jobs, so I had to work to impress them (and that's also why I was expected to do a lot of chores that I know most children are not expected to do). If I wasn't making him proud, I was considered worthless and forced to apologize to him yet again for how worthless and useless I was. 

When I was 12, I was finally allowed to stay home alone after school until my parents and sister arrived home, instead of going to a daycare after school every day until my mother could pick us up after work. On the third day of staying home alone for the first time in my life, a really bad storm ripped through our city and our home was struck by lightning. I was sitting on the couch next to the fireplace when the lightning struck the gas line to the chimney. Immediately there was a flash of light and a loud CRACK! My ears were ringing like I'd just survived a bomb explosion. I looked over to see that the fireplace was now on fire--the mantle and the curtains above the fire place too. And the fire was growing rapidly. I ran to my next-door-neighbor's house and told her what was going on. She told me that she would try to put the fire out, and to go across the street because there was a firefighter who lived across from us. I rang his doorbell, explained the situation, and he grabbed his fire extinguisher and ran over to my house. My next-door-neighbor was inside, trying to put the fire out but she said nothing was working. He told the two of us to wait outside and get away from the house. He went in to try to put it out, but he came out and told us that the lightning must've hit the gas line to the fireplace because the fire extinguisher wasn't putting it out. It was constantly being fed gas and it was already too big to manage. We had already called 911 and my dogs were outside in the backyard. We called my grandmother because my father was away on a business trip and my mother was still at work and couldn't answer the phone. She came and got me and the dogs into her minivan, and we watched from the street as fire trucks, police officers, an ambulance, and news vehicles swarmed the area. It was raining, with some crazy lightning, thunder, and wind. And we just watched as my childhood home burned to ash. I remember a huge fiery tornado engulfing the top of the house, causing the roof to collapse and eventually the whole house collapsed in on itself and continued to burn. The firefighters eventually were able to turn off the gas running to the house, but by then it was too late. The whole house was totaled, and nothing was salvageable. Everything was completely charred black. We had to start completely from scratch--all we had were the clothes that we were wearing that day. We stayed with my grandmother and cousin until we could eventually move to our new home. 

My parents worked hard to buy all new kitchen supplies, new clothes, toiletries, etc. and to find a new home, figure out insurance, etc. And even years later, whenever they told the story of the fire that burned down our home, they lamented all of the belongings we had lost and how hard it was to start from scratch. How hard it was to lose all those pictures, memories, everything. But not once was it ever mentioned that I was home alone when it happened. I was the only one actually present to witness everything from start to finish. I was the only one who actually experienced the fire as a kid, but not once did my parents worry about me. Not once did they ask if I was okay, or how it affected me afterwards. Not once was I ever considered. By the time I was 12, I already knew that I was unimportant. The only times I ever mattered to my father (and by extension my mother, since all she cared about was how my father felt and what my father thought), were the times when I was making him proud and making him look good. ""Look! My son won his team's tournament!"", ""Look! My son got all A's again!"", ""Look! My son can fix things around the house and cook and everything!"" All other times, I was a failure who wasn't worth anything at all. My parents' love for me was extremely conditional--by this point I already knew that. But I thought in time that they would care enough about me to stop thinking about how horribly the fire impacted *them* and just stop for one second to ask me if I was okay. If I was hurt. Or to ask how I was feeling, and whether or not I still thought about the fire. Ask me if I still had nightmares about that experience, or what happened to me that day. But that time never came. To this day I still think about that, and how the fire itself wasn't nearly as traumatic for me as being completely left behind. Not only did I have to save myself from the fire, but I also had to perform my own recovery and my own therapy afterwards. I had to look in the mirror and tell *myself* that everything was going to be okay, that I was glad I was safe and unharmed, that ***I*** cared about me and wanted me to be okay. I'll never forget that.

When I was 13, things had gone back to normal for the most part and I was once again Cinderella. Expected to be perfect at all times, and told horrible things about myself whenever I faltered. This was the age at which I started to develop a deep depression. My father's abuse was always extremely random and sudden, very unpredictable. I walked on eggshells around him, because I knew that at any moment he could snap. If I didn't meet his expectations, he became abusive. If he had a bad day at work, he would take it out on me. If he felt disrespected by someone, he would come home to abuse me. But if he could use me as a trophy, however, *then* *I was the best son in the world*\--I was to be celebrated and bragged about to everyone he knew. And then, the very next day, I would come home from school and swim practice, and he would get home from work around the same time. And I remember one day, he arrived home less than a minute after me, and he walked in the door from the garage into the kitchen to find me getting my homework out of my backpack to put it onto the kitchen table and get started on it. He then noticed that the dogs' water bowl was empty. Immediately, the whole atmosphere changed in the house and he said in a very threatening voice, ""why is their water bowl empty?"" I had just gotten home, and I hadn't been there all day. I didn't know their water bowl was empty because I hadn't even gotten the chance to look at it yet. But I knew from that menacing tone that he used (which was all too familiar) that no matter what I said to him, he was going to abuse me. So I became terrified, as I so often was around him. I said ""I don't know, I just got ho--""

""WHY IS THEIR WATER BOWL EMPTY!!!!!!!!???""

""...I'm [REDACTED_NAME]--""

""HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT?? HOW ABOUT YOU DON'T DRINK TONIGHT?? LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!""

My father then proceeded to scream at me about how much of a failure I was, about how I was worthless, had no value, and that all I ever did was leech off of him and suck his money and life away like a parasite that he had to live with in the same home, that I was so useless I couldn't even keep the dogs' water bowl filled, and that all I was good for was wasting his and everyone else's precious time and resources. He then grabbed the dog bowl and began to fill it up at the sink in silence. I stood there, stunned, not looking anywhere but at my homework the whole time. He walked past me, towering over me, intimidating me, and said ""you're worthless"". He then stormed off to his bedroom, slammed the door, and left me there in silence. My mother and sister walked in later, no clue if they heard all of that or not, but my sister went to her room and my mother got on the house computer to do whatever she was going to do. They seemed completely oblivious as to what had just happened, and I gathered my things quietly and went to my room to do my homework. I didn't drink or eat anything that night. I just stayed in my room and eventually went to sleep. The next day, my mother told me that I needed to apologize to my father for what I did. I walked up to him while he was watching TV, he didn't look at me once, and said ""what did you do wrong?"" I said I didn't fill the dogs' water bowl when I should have. ""And how do you think you should be punished for that?"" I said I didn't know. ""Then you can go to your room and think about it until you do know"". This was very common whenever I had to apologize to him.

After years of this abuse--sometimes physical, but usually verbal/emotional, and always terrifying and unpredictable--I became severely depressed and anxious. For whatever reason, what ended up pushing me over the edge one day was a specific interaction with my father that sticks with me to this day. 

When I was 16, I had been doing competitive swimming for 4 years. It was probably the one sport I hated most, dreading every single practice and swim meet. But my father would not let me stop, and what I wanted didn't matter. As a parent with NPD, all that ever mattered was what he wanted. His emotions were what mattered, and tending to his fragile emotional state was my responsibility. 

One day, my swim teammates told me that they could see my ass crack through my swim suit. And after practice, I looked at the swim suit in the mirror at home and saw that it was disintegrating in the back after years of use. It was the only suit I had, because my father didn't want to buy any more for me. I brought it to him and showed him how it was disintegrating and told him that all of my teammates could see through it and they told me I needed a new one. I hated approaching him to ask for anything, because I knew he would hold it over my head like he did with everything he bought for me--even basic necessities. Since this wasn't even a basic necessity, I knew this interaction would be very intimidating and end up badly for me. But he was the one who forced me to do swimming even though I hated it, and he was the only one with money at this point (my mother did not have a job anymore because she chose to stay home around the time when I was 13-14), so I had no choice but to approach him. So when he said ""what are you asking me?"" I said I needed a new swim suit for practice. He then took off his glasses, looked at me straight in the eyes and said, ""And what do you think you've done to deserve that?"" It became clear that he wanted me to continue to swim at practice with a disintegrating swim suit so that I would be embarrassed and ashamed. My heart sank, because I already knew what he was telling me. He wasn't going to buy a new swim suit for me, but I still had to keep going to practice anyway. He told me that I didn't do anything noteworthy to deserve a new speedo. Keep in mind, my father is a doctor. He had a lot of money. He just didn't feel like I was worth a new speedo because I hadn't recently brought any praise or recognition to him through my merits. I felt ashamed, and scared, and I walked to my room and put my swim suit back into my bag to take it to practice the next day. My coach felt bad, and I lied and said my father couldn't afford another swim suit yet, so my coach found an old swim suit in the lost and found and gave me that one to use instead. That was also where I had to get all of my swim goggles and gear from, to avoid approaching my father. It was pretty often that I had to just ""figure it out"" in life. I certainly wanted to avoid approaching my father any time I could. He was a very menacing, abusive man.

Later in the month, when I did have something of merit to show my father, I felt relieved. I had my report card, with all A's again. He looked at it, and said ""that's good, all A's"" and I exhaled a sigh of relief, silently. He then told me he would make a copy of it. I asked him what he meant, and that was when I learned that he had always made copies of all my report cards to store them up for himself to look at. It was the first time I actually got angry openly. I told him I didn't want him to make a copy of it. I said that the only reason he wanted that was for his own self-fulfillment and so he could brag and use me as a trophy. I told him that he didn't get to use me as a trophy in public when he says all of these horrible things to me in private. 

He looked at me with rage and disgust, and I immediately regretted what I had said. He said, ""I have never been unreasonable to you."" And then, while I stood there stunned yet again, he got up and walked off into his room, slamming the door, and went to his office to make a copy of my report card anyway. Those words stung, and I couldn't get them out of my head for the rest of the week. So that's when, one night when I was 16, while everyone else was out of the house and I was home alone, I tried to take my own life. I will not go into detail, but basically I failed. I was enrolled in therapy. And my depression became so bad that I developed a psychosis and started to see hallucinations and imagine things that never happened or weren't real (but I was fully convinced they were real and they did happen). During this time, for probably the next 2 years, I had a very difficult time separating these dreams, hallucinations, imagined events, etc. from reality. Life became very confusing, and I was deeply depressed and miserable. 

When I was 18, I got a full-ride scholarship to a university, and I left and never came back. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] 25 now, and I haven't spoken to my parents since I cut them off 6-7 years ago. I told them I never wanted to see them again, and I blocked them. I changed my legal name. I moved around. It was honestly really tough at times. I suffered from homelessness a few times, and have been financially struggling ever since, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] pursuing my career goal to become a physician one day. I've completed all the undergrad requirements, and I have lots of work experience, shadowing hours, and volunteer hours in the medical field. I still have a few things I'd like to accomplish before applying to medical school though. 

First, I've applied to become a medical scribe so that I can get more clinical experience and make sure this is what I really want to do as a career for the rest of my life. I would also like to get better at Spanish before I go to medical school. I can speak Spanish proficiently after learning it in college, and I can read and write it very well, but I'd like to become fluent one day by living in a Spanish-speaking country if I can, for at least long enough to gain fluency. Then I'd like to return to the US to learn medical interpretation so that I can be a doctor who serves the patient populations I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about here in the US (limited English proficiency Spanish speakers and poor people). I don't know if I'll be able to accomplish all of that before I get impatient and just take the MCAT and apply for medical school anyway, but I'd like to at least make progress towards those goals first. I also have to gain more financial stability, pay off all my debts and loans, and save up A LOT before I would feel comfortable applying to medical school. So for now, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] working my butt off as a server at a nice restaurant full-time and (hopefully soon) a medical scribe part-time. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] taking my time, making sure I'm [REDACTED_NAME] financially, and waiting for my time to come. It will be a few years until I finally pay off all of my debts and loans and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] able to save up like I want to, but I've resolved myself to what I need to do and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] okay with being as patient as I need to be to achieve my goals.

I now draw in my free time, and I wear whatever I want to. I have been seeing a great guy, and I hope to become his boyfriend soon. All in all, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a really good place compared to the darkness I lived in for the first 18 years of my life. That darkness still haunts me to this day, and as the title of this post mentions, I often mourn the life I could've had, if only my parents had been good ones. I think about what my life would be like if only a relative or someone had witnessed my father's abuse and saved me back then. I wonder how much better my life would be right now if I had just been able to escape the hell that I lived in so much earlier, or maybe if my parents weren't abusive, or if I just had different parents. I find myself longing for what other people have in terms of family, and wondering what their childhoods were like, what kinds of memories they have. I am [REDACTED_NAME] envious of others, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] just happy for them if they've had a good childhood and parents. I've longed for that. Wished for it. But ultimately I've accepted reality, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] glad that other people have had much better lives and childhoods. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] grateful that my life has been as good as it has been, because it could've been so much worse. I've seen worse and I've heard about worse. I read about worse, and I just have so much empathy for those children. Or those people in horrific situations. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] they have longed for better just like I have. 

I've been told that it's something you have to grieve like a death--the life you could've had. And while I will continue to grieve, and heal, I will also continue to wake up every day as I have been for a long time now, with a profound sense of gratitude for the life I've lived and how my life has been so much better than it could've been. I am [REDACTED_NAME] grateful for the freedom and the peace that I've been able to feel ever since leaving my parents behind. That was the best decision I've ever made, and I honestly feel like if I died tomorrow I would be content. I feel like I did the big thing that I was supposed to do. I've achieved freedom from that hell, and I'll keep moving forward. I am [REDACTED_NAME] grateful for what I have. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. There's so much more to my story, but this post is already long enough lol. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with what I've been able to share. I want anyone else reading this to find this freedom for themselves, if you haven't already. 

I'll be rooting for you.  :)",135
1loubwu,1751350411.0,2025-07-01 06:13:31,TrueOffMyChest,I cheated on my IQ test to get a higher score because I have social anxiety... lmao?,"Hi everyone. I am a girl, I am [REDACTED_NAME] years old (but please don't just disregard my story for it), and I have a mess inside me right now, and no one to tell this to, so I’m dumping it all here from a burner account.

This started when I was a little girl: I have always felt I was acting the ""normal"" version of a person, what people were supposed to be like. 

I've always felt different from my classmates and friends, but I could hardly put my finger on the why; I thought I was normal in the mind department, at first, but eventually I came to the conviction that I was stupid. No one thought like me. Where I saw something deep, analysis-worthy, others saw idiotic, banal stuff; they all said I overthought everything at best, that I was stupid was the standard. 

I don't think I can explain this well. I took note of small things that I thought were important while everyone else ""knew"" they were stupid and irrelevant. I thought about all what people took for granted. Everyone else just ""knew"" things while I deeply thought about it and ended up with conclussions all the others told me were crazy, wrong, a stretch.

And even as a little girl, I felt ashamed by the way I was. I thought I was weird. So I started acting: Watched TV shows to copy how kids my age acted, adopted their mannerisms and ways, asked about things I already knew (because ""normal"" kids were supposed to be dumb!), played silly games that really bored me, translated all of my thoughts into smaller, simpler words; what I thought were child-like words. I remember being furious that adults talked to me like I was dumb, not realizing the other kids did need that tone.

In short, I got tired of feeling like an outcast even in my own head.  Became hypervigilant, second-guessing if my every word and action looked ""normal"", ""childlike"" or ""teenlike"" enough. By middle school I was a bizarre portrayal of a caricature of what I thought teenagers were like. Still... it didn't really work. I couldn't crack, mimic, other people's behavior. I still got called 'autistic', as an insult, a million times: for zoning out, not liking what my other classmates were into - popstars, gossip, boys and sports (Not exaggerating when I say those are the only topics EVER). For questioning things and disagreeing with almost everyone on almost everything (even on the ""obvious"" things I got called stupid for), having complex thoughts and making complex relations I couldn't explain without making my speech trangled and confusing aswell, so basically no one understood when I talked; I was deemed smug for being a ""know-it-all"", and so much more. 

Eventually, I started believing I was dumb, ugly, boring, and weird. It got so bad I changed schools seven times and still never felt I fit in with anyone. When I was thirteen, I began having awful panic attacks before school, so my parents homeschooled me.

Then, my mom met this neuropsychopedagogue who is specialized in giftedness, also gifted herself. They together got the idea that I was very probably gifted. Apparently I showed early signs: saying my first word (my own name) at four months old, speaking full sentences at nine months old, teaching myself to read at three, among others.

So I got really hyped up with this idea: honestly I started reading about other gifted people's experiences and though I always believed myself to be very dumb, they ALL hit SO close home. Everything fit perfectly. Under the lights of giftedness, I understood things about myself that were a mystery once. I felt I understood the way I was and why, why my life turned out the way it did, why I never fit.

I even started talking online with other gifted people and finally made amazin, real friends who, despite me finding them intimidating, didn’t judge me. I could share a tangled thought and for once in my life they would actually follow and add to it. For once, I wasn’t mocked for being nerdy or annoying. They were as geeky as me. 

But then everything went to hell when I started my IQ test.

There is nothing to explain. I know for a fact I got every answer wrong. Even the really stupid ones I realized a second after the time limit was over. But I really am a stupid slut who hoped to have a community among... gifted people? I don't know what I was thinking. Well, in other words, just by the second meeting I realized I was totally not gifted. In fact, my scores would realistically be likely lower than average. So, it was over - But - as stupid as it sounds - I’d gotten so attached to the idea. I’d already told my gifted friends I was gifted. 

And, more important than that and even worse, I needed that label to justify why I felt so worthless. so weird, lonely, outcasted, misunderstood and sad. I wanted it as an explanation and redeeming quality, I wanted to say ""I’m not boring and weird and annoying as they said; I’m just too smart for them"" and for it to be true. I found every single story I'd heard from gifted people extremely relatable for the first time in my lifem I wanted that community, full of people that felt just like me.

I couldn't stand losing that. Not even if I had to cheat for it.

So! Here we are. I looked up the test answers (WISC-V), copied them into a notebook, and read them during the sessions. Of course, I aced almost everything. I’m now waiting for results. If I did understand and calculated all of these correctly, I am [REDACTED_NAME] about 140, 150 IQ points.

But hell, why did I think I would be happy with that? I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. It’s meaningless; That number is fake. My original answers were catastrophic. I am [REDACTED_NAME] stupid as I always feared. And those friends I thought I had aren’t real, because I lied to them, and I’ll keep lying.

But the worst of it is; once again, I don't get to belong - anywhere, anywhere at all. I have to lie to myself and everyone to find some value in what I am. 

Is there anything sadder?

Well. What do we think, reddit.",0
1ingu1b,1739328206.0,2025-02-12 02:43:26,TrueOffMyChest,I had an allergic reaction and it led to being called psychotic and raped,"First, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to acknowledge that my story will sound so fake but it isn't. This really happened to me.

I ate a weird spice one night by accident at my boyfriend's dad's house. I thought it was pepper. But it wasn't. I never had an allergic reaction before. I just thought my throat was burning because it was spicy. I never ate spice before. So, I didn't even know that spice shouldn't feel so terrible. I ignored it because my boyfriend didn't seem concerned.

A few days later, my face was very stuffed and felt swollen. The doctor gave me flu medication. It didn't help. 2 days later I started hyperventilating. I went back to the doctor's one week after I went the first time. They gave me prednisone and steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler. I got better for a few hours from the prednisone, but I ended up hyperventilating again.

I went back to the doctor's. They gave me a chest x-ray. They said they found nothing on the x-ray and said I just had post nasal drip from the flu. Mind you, I literally talked with the doctors for 5 minutes nonstop and she could HEAR and SEE me struggling to talk and breathe. 

I ended up going to an ENT because I felt like my ears and throat were a problem. 
The ENT couldn't even put his endoscope up my nose because my nose was so swollen and infected. He gave an antibiotic and ordered a CT scan and an allergy medication (L). I also told him that my face felt like it was melting and I am [REDACTED_NAME] heart problems. His response? I'm [REDACTED_NAME] ears, nose, and throats doctor ONLY... go see a heart doctor. 

Within a few days, I ended up at the ER. I was severely hyperventilating and my face felt so messed up and my heart was pounding. At this point, I was taking Nyquil and the antibiotic and the steroid nasal spray and the steroid inhaler and the steroid pill, prednisone. The ER wrote in my medical records ""allergic reaction to prednisone"". He never said that to us in person. He even said to take the remaining prednisone. He advised and wrote on my packet ""do not take sudafed"" and (despite my boyfriend saying that i do not have any history of anxiety) gave me anxiety medication. He also talked about other patients in front of my ER room because it was across from all the computers. I could see the MRIs from my room.

I was released. A little over 12 hours later, I went back to the ER. At this point, I had severe tingling in my face and it was burning and I was becoming disoriented. The doctor just brushed me and prescribed me Sudafed. We showed the nurse that the other ER doctor said no sudafed. But we were told that it would be fine.

I took sudafed. It caused severe disorientation and a bunch of other symptoms. So, I went to the ER again. Okay, I probably sounded crazy because I could only describe my symptoms by saying that I had sepsis. Not that I necessarily believed that I had sepsis. There was a severe misunderstanding and I was so messes up from the medication that I could not communicate effectively. I also repeated things that the first ER doctor talked about outside of room.... so I definitely sounded crazy... but like I said, my communication level was very messed up. This visit just ended up threatening to baker act me.

Baker act is basically forcing you to go to a mental institute.

But once again, I was not told to stop taking any medication.

The next day was extremely rough. I was screaming about how my face felt like it was melting and my nerves in my face were disconnecting and my insides felt like they were rotting from the inside out. My boyfriend called the pharmacist. The pharmacist said that if this was atypical behavior and it started after medication then I was stoned and he recommended to take me off medication and to bring me to a health clinic.

The next morning I was brought to a health clinic. But instead of talking to a doctor, I talked with a psychologist. My boyfriend said I could talk about anything. So, me being me.... I talked about how I fell down when I was 12 and the issues that I had. Because that's what was on my mind at the moment with my leg hurting. Then I started talking about my breathing problems but also repeated what the first ER doctor said about the other patients. My boyfriend told the psychologist that I was talking about what the ER doctor said but ignored him.

Then I was brought into the x-ray room. They didn't have x-ray technician. Instead a nurse gave me my x-ray. She told me the wrong positions. Mind you, it was all but 2 weeks ago I had an x-ray done and had to do it twice due to my skirt's zipping ruining the first set of x-rays. This nurse gave me all the wrong positions. So I told the nurse that it was done wrong. Then she asked me to demonstrate. I demonstrated. Then afterwards, she said that she can't do the x-ray again. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I'm [REDACTED_NAME] leaving until you do it again. So we had a big argument. The police were called because I wouldn't leave the room. Then police got there, talked with me, were super fricken confused by the entire situation. They were like whatever. But the nurses had me baker acted. 

So I went to a mental institute. Again, I told them that I was in a lot of (physical) pain. And once again, I was ignored. I told them the turn of events that I've experienced. And then my boyfriend comes in. The psychologist lady started basically saying that I was crazy and my boyfriend entertained the idea. I told my boyfriend to stop and I don't belong here and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] real, physical pain.

Then I was left in a room by myself for a long while. Then eventually was told that I had to stay. I was brought into a unit. I got a drink. The first person I met was someone who shared my first name. I kid you very not. Can you imagine how that made me feel in the moment? Maybe I really was crazy. (But it was true! Just like everything else!)

I went to lay down in my bed. But once again, I was in significant pain. I started screaming and screaming. The nurse ran over and continuously said ""You're not in pain""... which made me scream louder. Then I screamed to call my boyfriend. And then instead, they called a bunch of nurses and sedated me.

And the next thing I woke up to was being assaulted. I'll skip those details. I remember so vividly the nurse giving my sweater to clean myself off with and then me dropping the sweater on my shoes.... and the nurse helping me pull up my underwear... 

I refused medication other than my antibiotic. After a day and a half, I started feeling better and I started remembering that something bad happened to me. The psychologist brought me into a room. I said I want a lawyer.

I was brought into a different room. This lady said that I had to take the medication or else I wouldn't be able to get a lawyer.

So I started taking it.... and I started feeling very messed up again. I stayed for 2 weeks.... being drugged up... and I was forced into an put patient program and was forced into taking more drugs and more drugs. I kept having severe side effects from medications... so they just kept me on the same medications and gave me more medication for the side effects. 

Then I found out that I was 8 weeks pregnant a month after I was admitted initially to the mental institute. I was so drugged up. All I could say was that something bad happened to me to my boyfriend. He looked up the medications... and the problems that occur to fetuses were not good. I ended up having an abortion. 

I... can't describe the terror.

I continued to take the medication after the outpatient program for about 2-3 weeks. My boyfriend was very pissed off. He said the doctors said that I was psychotic and I needed the medication for a year plus minimum or for a lifetime.

I tried telling him over and over and over that it was the medication, not because I was psychotic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!

I eventually went through the timeline with him, describing everything with him. He finally recognized that it was very fishy. 

He went to see a therapist. We were arguing about me being off medication and how I wasn't going to go see a therapist or psychologist or how I wasn't going to pick up new medication ""just in case"". He talked to his therapist. His therapist said ""Let her, she's an adult.""

I cannot... I cannot express my gratitude.... I can't express the terror I went through.... I cannot express my gratitude to someone I never met to finally listen to what I was saying.

And then I was off of them officially. There was no argument anymore. And guess what? My heart rate went back to normal. My face pain slowly subsided. My brain stopped being all fogged up. I started being able to focus and not move like a slug. I regained my strength where I could finally open my Gatorade bottles again. Most of all, I felt relief and a return to normalcy.

And then... slowly the emotions of what happened to me really hit me. I started having panic attacks because the memories started coming. Slowly my memory started coming in more and more and more. And then I remembered that I was raped. And the series of events that happened afterwards and talking to my boyfriend. Oh how messed up... how painful.

I tried to get a lawyer. But the malpractice lawyer says that I have to talk to a criminal attorney. The criminal attorney says that I have to get a civil attorney. No one is willing to accept my case.

It's been over a year and a couple of months since.

I have to get this off my chest. My boyfriend is amazing. I love him so dearly. He really is a great, cuddly, loving boyfriend. Did he call me every day while I was in the mental institute? Yes. He visited me twice too. But.... but.... the problem is... he didn't believe me when I needed him to. He didn't stand up for me when I needed him to. He believes me now. He's stood up for me since.

I started having allergic reactions that led into anaphylaxis... aka I started hyperventilating again...this past summer. I went to a different medical group about it. I was hyperventilating, very noticeably. My boyfriend and I signed up like 2 months prior to the same doctor. He ironically had an appointment the same day. So, she saw the both of us.... him for his lab results and me for hyperventilating. 

The first thing she said was that I was having a panic attack. My boyfriend said she is having an allergic reaction, not a panic attack. She said ""Fine, I will give her a high dosage of something like benadryl. If she doesn't get better in 15 minutes then she's having a panic attack."" She gives me the shot and... guess what, I got better within 15 minutes. Point proven.

POINT PROVEN!!!!! 

POINT PROVEN!!!!!! 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I took the next day off because I was so fricken passed out. I went the next day. But I started hyperventilating again. I called my doctor again. She gave me an asthma medication. It helped a lot. 

A few weeks later, I thought I had like a sinus type of infection. She prescribed me the same antibiotics as the ENT months and months beforehand, before I was admitted to the ER. I ended up having a fast heart rate and other weird side effects. I told my doctor and she switched antibiotics. I felt way better after that. But I made an appointment to see her because she said she wouldn't prescribe more without seeing me.

Then she said I likely have asthma and my allergic reaction are being caused from asthma. She prescribed me an allergy medication (L), which the ENT also had prescribed me month and months prior and a nasal spray.

My face within a day of taking (L) medication started burning. I called my doctor and told her. She said stop taking it but use the nasal spray. This was a Friday. I made an appointment on Monday. She couldn't make it. I talked with an doctor (a man) who was basically dismissive and rude. My boyfriend stood up for me then too and acknowledged the male doctor was just stupid.

My doctor called me the next day. I told her that my face was still burning. She said okay stop taking all medication, switch to Allegra only, and use a nasal rinse 3 times a day for the next 3 days and then go down to 2 per day. She has also made me stay on the asthma medication after I got better. 

And it worked.

I haven't had any face burning... or hyperventilating. Whenever I eat something that burns my throat (like I drank a sip from a German beer or another time from an Indian dish, for examples), I immediately take Allegra / benadryl and my asthma medication, and I end up okay.

Point proven... I was not psychotic. I had severe side effects from medication. I lacked communication. I was raped. I was drugged to forget about the rape. I was used as an insurance piggy. I was ignored. I was mistreated. I was made me to feel crazy. And all I had was an allergic reaction that could've been simply resolved.

And you know what... after everything. I love my boyfriend so much. He's been my rock since. He's realized his mistakes. We are about to celebrate Valentine's Day. But you know? I can't see him or feel for him the same way I used to.... he believed the doctors over me when I needed him the most to believe me and listen to me and care for me... I feel absolutely terrible... I think he knows.... I'm [REDACTED_NAME] darn sure he knows. He's trying so hard to make up for it. I wish I could just go back to feeling how I felt before... but I just can't. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sorry.... ",3
1d03w3f,1716611222.0,2024-05-25 04:27:02,TrueOffMyChest,I gave flowers to my husband today and his reaction made me realize I might be a bad wife.,"Recently, my friends made fun of me (35F) saying that my husband (32M) is the romantic one of our relationship. And aparently he wins by a big margin in that department. They even scoffed at the idea that I could be romantic at all. This made me start to be self conscious about it as one of my friends went on detail how much more romantic he is compared to all my friends husbands and how I am [REDACTED_NAME] total oposite. 

This has been on my mind all week, and today, a male coworker was talking about how his wife gave him flowers and how he was surprisingly happy about it, so I thought ""well, why not? He buys me flowers all the time, I should start being more romantic.""

After work I went to pick up a bouquet and headed home. When I arrived he was playing with our daughter (5yo) and I gave him the bouquet and said ""I was thinking about you and got you this""

He started crying, he cried so so much. He thanked me and hugged me and then went look for a vase to put the flowers. Throughout the night he cried randomly 2 separate times. I asked him if anything else happened for him to be that way and he said no, that he was just happy that I got him flowers and was feeling a bit emotional. 

And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] thinking, am I a terrible wife? He gets me flowers all the time and I never get emotional like that. Not even close. Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] back and I don't do nearly as much for him compared to what he does for me in every way, and my friends are 100% right, romantically he kicks my ass. I just feel absolutely terrible because I love him more than anything. He is my world and I could not even think of myself without him. He is an amaizing husband, an even better father and mostly, he is my best friend. But I guess I don't show him how much I appreciate him and he doesn't know how much I love him and that makes me so sad. And then that makes me feel even worse because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of myself instead of him.

Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in bed, I can't sleep thinking about this, I dont know if I should talk to him about it or if I should just quietly try to be better and show him how much I appreciate him.",12685

Prologue

“I never knew when was the last time he looked at me like he did at the beginning. Only one day did he stop doing it…”

I want to reiterate this is my truth about all the events that happened so far in my life...

This kind of experience, I need to share with someone, to externalize everything that happened to me so far, it's been difficult so far. All I can think of is that every heartbreak is proof that I can love again... I’m thankfull for all the pain.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to start by the present moment, listening music using this app as a diary, trying journaling -- not very successful at it. So this is it…

It is past midnight, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] on the floor of my kitchen, my back resting against the fridge, legs stretched in silence. In my hand, a half-full lass of wine. Next to me, a crumpled napkin with almond crumbs and a folded note I never managed to throw away in my journal. It’s the one he left me with the first Valentine we spent together. I told myself I kept it out of absentmindedness, but the truth is more dangerous than that: I kept it because it gave shape to something I once believed in. I don’t even know what I’m hoping for now...

I’ve been trying to write tis story for a while. Not because I want revenge, not because I want pity. But because if I don’t take this pain out of my chest, I’m afraid it will become a permanent scar that doesn’t heal. I am [REDACTED_NAME] writing this for him. I’m writing this for the version of me that keeps showing up at 5 a.m. with a hole in his stomach, gasping for air, wondering…. Why do someone who promised care chose brutal and complete silence instead.

This story is not just about “him”.  It’s  all the ghost that came before him. The ones I kissed. The ones I forgave. The one I waited for at stations they never arrived to. This is my way of making sure that I do not become the sum of who left me. Feeding my open wounded traumas that I once thought they healed.

Some people confuse heartbreak and vulnerability with weakness. I no longer do… Every heartbreak is a proof that I can still love. Deeply. Completely. Even if I have to learn again how to love myself after it. It is a proof that I am [REDACTED_NAME] in this world.

So here it goes. My story. In fragments of what I recall. In wounds that still burns. In the little acts of courage that came from holding someone’s hand without fear of people’s gaze, and in the even greater ones of letting it go.

And if one day someone finds this story and sees their own reflection in it then maybe all this mattered. Learn from me, learn from my feelings and my pain...

Chapter I: Before Loving

1. A Sensitive Childhood

I remember the softness of the white sheets and the smell of soap on Mom’s T-shirt when she hugged me before bed. My childhood was happy, sheltered by the warmth of a small family in which Mom was the center of everything. Mom—so young and strong—was both refuge and heroine; in her arms I felt protected from the world. I was a profoundly sensitive child: I cried at sad movies, was moved by lullabies, and needed physical affection the way plants need the sun.

From a very young age I developed a vivid imagination. I spent hours watching the clouds, inventing stories about the shapes only I could see in the sky or in the stains on the ceiling. I played in my room, silently, while Mom watched me with a smile.

There were few luxuries at home, but hugs and sweet words were abundant. Whenever sadness or incomprehension knocked at the door of my small chest, I sought comfort in a soft plush bear that always slept with me. I would stroke its fabric ears and press it against my racing heart, finding secret solace in that toy embrace. Mom often found me asleep with the teddy bear trapped between my arms and would tuck me in tenderly without waking me. To me, that stuffed animal and my mother’s hugs were synonymous with home and safety.

2. Loss and the Move

The year 2004 marked a rupture that split my life in two. On an autumn dawn my sister’s short life suddenly went out forever. Her sudden death struck us like lightning from a clear sky, leaving us stunned and torn apart. I remember Mom crying silently that night, believing I was asleep, but her sobs reached me through the wall. I was only a child and couldn’t fully grasp what death meant; I only felt an icy void in my stomach and a new fear—the fear of realizing that the people we love can disappear from one day to the next.

After the funeral, Mom decided that moving would be the best option, and my father—who had found another opportunity—accepted it without protest. Our home, once full of laughter and happy memories, had become a painful museum in which every corner whispered my absent sister’s name. We packed our lives into cardboard boxes amid silent tears. I remember putting my teddy bear into one of those boxes, afraid that in the new house it would no longer smell like our old life. We moved to another city in search of a new beginning, though I felt we left a piece of our soul behind those walls.

The move didn’t just mean a change of scenery—arriving in the Chilean desert—it also marked the beginning of a profound loneliness. In the new city I felt lost, friendless, with a mother carrying her own pain while trying to be strong for me, and I trying to be strong for her. Dad got a job and spent long hours away supporting us, so many afternoons I came back to a silent, empty house, while Mom, when she was home, devoted herself entirely to me.

One night, shortly after settling into the new house, I broke down in tears, clutching my pillow. Memories of my sister invaded the darkness of my unfamiliar room and the anguish overwhelmed me. Mom heard my sobs and rushed in. She sat on my bed and wrapped me in her protective arms.

“I know, my love, I know…” Mom whispered, cradling me against her chest.

I buried my face in her T-shirt and let her tears mix with mine.

“Why did she leave?” I cried, my voice breaking. “I miss her so much…”

“I don’t know, sweetheart,” she replied, her voice trembling slightly. “Sometimes things happen that we don’t understand. But I’m here with you. You’re not alone—never forget that.”

Her words, spoken with such love, were an anchor amid my pain. That night I fell asleep in her arms, listening to her heartbeat, and I silently promised myself to be strong for both of us—for Mom and for my sister’s memory.

3. Refuge in Imagination

Over time I learned to hide my sadness and my sense of strangeness behind a shy smile and a rich inner world. The words of my primary-school teacher echoed in my head as I matured so quickly after the loss: “The pain you feel will never disappear, but each day it will be easier to carry.”

I had always been prone to daydreaming, but after the loss it intensified. At school I was the quiet kid who drew in the margins of his notebooks and got lost staring out the window. While the other boys played soccer at recess, I preferred to sit under a tree reading or simply imagining stories.

My classmates’ inability to understand my sensitivity made me feel isolated. Some called me “weird” behind my back because I sometimes got too emotional in class or because I preferred talking about books instead of sports. Little by little, my refuge became my own mind. If I felt lonely at lunchtime, I pretended to talk with imaginary friends who always listened. On silent afternoons at home I invented conversations and fantastic adventures so I wouldn’t feel so alone. Mom would come to collect me, and I waited for her, telling stories to the air until I heard the key in the door and then recounted my day in detail.

Every night when I went to bed I still needed a hug to fall asleep. As I grew, my stuffed animals were relegated to the closet, replaced by a pillow that I hugged tightly to my chest. I missed human warmth, and by squeezing the pillow I could fool loneliness for a moment; I imagined it was someone holding me back in the darkness. That intimate habit became my best-kept secret—a small routine that let me feel safe, just as when Mom used to slip in quietly to tuck me in during childhood.

4. Secrets of the Heart

When puberty arrived, it brought more questions than answers. At the new school I made one or two friends—quiet boys with whom I shared comics and study sessions. Yet I began to realize I was different from them in a way I didn’t know how to name. I discovered it almost unintentionally, through a silent, deep attraction to a classmate. His name was Adrien; he had an easy laugh and honey-colored eyes that sparkled when he talked about what he loved. At first I thought what I felt for Adrien was admiration: I wanted to spend all my time beside him, I worried if he missed class, and I memorized each of his gestures without meaning to.

One afternoon, while we were doing homework in his room, I noticed myself tracing the line of his jaw when he looked away, or the way a lock of his brown hair fell across his forehead. My heart beat so fast I feared he could hear it in the silence around us.

That afternoon, back home, I replayed every moment of the day with a mix of excitement and shame. Why did my friend seem so handsome? Why did I want to hug him when he was sad, or simply stay over so I could wake up beside him? No other boy spoke of such things; they joked about girls while I nodded silently, feeling I carried an immense secret. With terror I began to understand that what I felt was not admiration but attraction—a yearning that not only cherished his good soul or the way he made me laugh, but also urged me to brush his hand, to be close in a way that frightened me.

Guilt accompanied me for months as I struggled to understand my feelings. Whenever I heard at church that true love could exist only between a man and a woman, my stomach knotted and I wondered if what I felt was wrong.

I was barely thirteen and already bore a secret that felt too heavy: I liked boys. Or rather, I liked one boy—Adrien—and I didn’t know whether that meant my whole being was different from everyone else’s. I said nothing. I didn’t tell Mom, afraid of disappointing her or losing her love. I confessed to no one. I learned to smile and pretend everything was normal while inside I wrestled with the piercing joy of feeling something beautiful and the terror of feeling something forbidden.

To cope, I returned to writing and fantasy. I filled secret diaries with letters I never dared to deliver, addressed to that friend to whom I never confessed the truth. In my stories, sometimes two princes fell in love in a distant kingdom, and I could give them the happy ending I didn’t believe possible for myself in reality. Those tales hidden under the mattress were my way of easing the pressure of an adolescent heart flooded with silences.

6. A Glance at the Airport

I was fourteen when I first experienced a clear and unmistakable desire—the kind that suddenly ignites the body. It happened in a Brazilian airport during a long layover on a trip with Mom and Dad. We were in the waiting lounge, surrounded by strangers and the distant murmur of loudspeakers. Bored, I let my gaze wander when my eyes met those of another boy, about my age, waiting across the room. He had dark hair, sun-bronzed skin, and an intent expression, as if he too were studying the travelers’ faces.

It was only an instant—a fraction of a second that felt outside of time: a sustained look that said everything without a single word. Heat surged up my neck to my cheeks. My chest leapt, and something inside me woke with force. In those unknown eyes I discovered desire. It wasn’t just that he was handsome—he was, with a fragile, captivating beauty—but the way my body reacted: an electric tingling over my skin, my palms sweating, and a new need to approach him, to hear his voice, to smell his T-shirt up close, to feel our arms brush.

He held my gaze, and for a moment the airport din vanished. Did he feel something similar? I’ll never know. A voice announced his flight; I watched him rise with his family and knew I would never see him again. Yet as he walked away, he turned his head once more toward me. He was still looking. I sat petrified, heart pounding. I held his gaze until the last second, until he vanished into the crowd. Then I exhaled, realizing I’d been holding my breath. I felt both dazed and euphoric.

Mom, sitting beside me, noticed nothing; she was reading a magazine, unaware of the silent revolution that had just shaken me. That brief encounter confirmed what I already suspected: it wasn’t just Adrien, it wasn’t a passing idea. My desire—my love—was directed toward other boys. And for the first time, instead of guilt, I felt a spark of pure authenticity ignite inside me.

6. Mom’s Comfort

That spark of self-acceptance wasn’t enough to dispel all my fears. Back home, I resumed my routine of silences and forced smiles. Adrien had changed schools and almost stopped seeing me; our friendship faded with distance, leaving the bittersweet taste of a first love that slips away before it is born. At fifteen I was a reserved boy with a secret world beating beneath a calm exterior. Mom sometimes saw an unnamed sadness in my eyes. Intuitive as ever, she sensed something was wrong, but she respected my silence.

One early morning I could no longer contain the pressure in my chest. I had spent the day feeling especially alone—maybe adolescence, hormones, or simply the weight of so many hidden thoughts. I sought refuge in my room and tried to sleep, hugging my pillow as usual, but that night the usual comfort never came. Tears began to fall and I couldn’t stop them. It was a low, almost silent cry, but in the stillness of the night any sob is deafening.

Mom opened my door carefully, lit only by the hallway’s dim light. She found me curled up on the bed, clutching a tear-soaked pillow. Without a word she slipped into bed beside me, as she did when I was little, and wrapped me in a warm embrace.

“Do you want to tell me?” she whispered, using the soft voice that always chased my storms away.

I shook my head, unable to meet her eyes. How could I explain the whirlwind inside me? I feared the truth would hurt her—or worse, disappoint her. But being there, in her arms, gave me back the sense that nothing bad could happen.

“It’s okay if you don’t want to talk,” she said, kissing my forehead. “I just want you to know that I love you exactly as you are, son. Nothing could change that, do you hear? Nothing.”

Her voice broke on the last word, showing she was speaking from the heart. I clung to her tighter, feeling the words I didn’t dare say spill into that embrace. In silence I asked forgiveness for not being the perfect son she might have imagined; in silence I begged her never to let me go.

“I love you, Mom,” I finally murmured in a whisper.

Her hand traced slow circles on my back, just as when I was a child frightened by nightmares, her thumb making a cross on my forehead.

“And I love you, my life. Always,” she answered, resting her cheek on my head.

We spoke no more—there was no need. I fell asleep with my face against her chest, exhausted but at peace, listening to the steady beating of her heart. Before drifting off, her last words echoed in my mind: I love you exactly as you are. Mom didn’t know it, but that was precisely what I needed to keep from collapsing—the certainty that, whatever my truth, her love would remain intact. That certainty became the compass guiding my idea of love in the years that followed me into adulthood.

The next morning no secret was revealed, no question asked. Mom smiled gently at breakfast, and I understood her complicit silence was her way of giving me space. I realized that, too, was a form of love.

That same morning, before heading to school, I paused at my bedroom door. I looked at the rumpled bed: the pillow still damp with night-time tears and, on the wrinkled sheets, timidly poking out, the old plush toy of my childhood that I had rescued from the closet sometime in the night. The sight overwhelmed me. For a moment, the child I had been and the young man I was becoming met in that reflection: both hugging something so as not to feel so alone, both silently longing for a love that had not yet arrived.

The scene repeated itself years later, tinged with more bitterness. Just as in childhood I had fallen asleep clutching my teddy bear for safety, as an adult I found myself crying in the early hours, hugging a pillow in a cold bed.",3
1kqkb6l,1747681918.0,2025-05-19 19:11:58,TrueOffMyChest,I’ve been silent for years. This is what I’ve never told anyone.,"Hello World!

You can call me Elisha. I’m 24.
That’s not my real name, but it’s the one I use when I need to speak honestly—without worrying who’s watching.

I’ve been silent for a long time.
Not because I didn’t have anything to say.
But because I honestly believed no one would care. Or worse
that they’d hear the wrong parts of me, and just… walk away.

So here it is. My story.
Not polished. Not pretty.
But true.

It’s not a story about victory.
Not yet.
It’s about a quiet life that cracked open,
about faith that burned out and maybe still flickers,
about leaving everything behind and still feeling like you brought the pain with you.
It’s a story of being young, tired, and alone—
but still breathing.

If you’re still reading after this, thank you.
This is where it begins.

Chapter 1 — My Mother’s Light

“Maybe home is nothing but two arms holding you tight when you’re at your worst.”
— Yara Bashraheel

I don’t remember a colorful childhood.
There weren’t many happy screams or long summer nights or memories you’d write songs about.

But I do remember her—my mom.
The one person who made home feel like more than just walls.

She wasn’t perfect.
She worked too hard, carried too much, and often had nothing left by the time she got home.
But she gave me something sacred:
Presence.
Her being near made everything hurt a little less.

She didn’t give long talks or deep advice.
She didn’t always have answers.
But she was there.

When my father was distant, she noticed.
When I was quiet, she didn’t force me to speak.
She just sat next to me.
Sometimes that was enough.

I didn’t need toys or trips.
Just her hands in the kitchen, her voice calling me to dinner, her sighs late at night as she folded clothes.
That was comfort.

Looking back, I think she knew more than she said.
Maybe she knew she couldn’t protect me from what was coming.
But she gave me something stronger:
The memory that I was once safe.
That I mattered to someone.

And when things later began to fall apart—
that memory kept me breathing.

Chapter 2 — The Quiet Fracture

“The soul usually knows what to do to heal itself. The challenge is to silence the mind.”
— Caroline Myss

I was still a kid when it happened.
Not just in age—inside, too. I still thought people were good by default. Still believed adults knew what they were doing. Still trusted the world.

I was at a friend’s place one winter, during school break.
We were just playing games, like always.
But then he showed me something.
Not a game. Something… different.

It wasn’t terrifying.
It was strange. Quiet.
Like something I wasn’t supposed to see, but couldn’t look away from either.

I didn’t know what it meant.
Didn’t fully understand what I was feeling.
But a door inside me opened—
and no one told me to close it.

That moment turned into more.
Photos. Videos. Repetition. Curiosity.
And silence.
Always silence.

My sister would walk in and ask what we were doing.
We’d lie. “Just playing.”
We’d promise we’d delete it.
We didn’t.

I got used to the lying.
I got used to the weird rush and the shame that followed it.
But I didn’t have words for any of it.
I didn’t know I was forming a wound I’d carry into adulthood.

I thought maybe this was just growing up.
I mean, no one warned me otherwise.
No one told me it mattered.

But deep down, part of me was shrinking.
Every time.
Like something inside me knew this wasn’t freedom. It was a quiet chain.

I look back now, and I don’t blame the younger me.
He was just trying to figure out how to feel something.
To feel seen.
To escape.

But I wish someone had come into that room, looked me in the eye, and said:

“You don’t have to carry this. This was never yours to hold.”

No one did.
So I held it.
And I kept holding it—
for years.

Chapter 3 — Light in the Ashes

“God comes to us disguised as our life.”
— Paula D’Arcy

I didn’t go to that camp expecting anything.
It was just another church trip.
Some people go to find Jesus.
I went because someone suggested it, and I didn’t have the energy to say no.

The first few days were… fine.
Group games. Cheap food. Acoustic worship sets under trees.
I felt out of place, like I was watching from behind glass.
Everyone seemed to be “feeling God.”
I wasn’t.
I smiled, nodded, stayed quiet.

And then one night, during worship, something happened.

I was standing in the back.
Not singing. Not praying. Just standing.
Kind of numb. Kind of skeptical.
Kind of lost.

But something shifted.

It wasn’t a voice.
Not a vision.
It was more like… a feeling I hadn’t felt in years.
Like someone saw me. Actually saw me.

No spotlight. No tears.
Just this sudden, silent awareness that I wasn’t invisible.
Not to God.
Not in that moment.

I didn’t break down or raise my hands.
I didn’t cry or confess.
I just stood there and let it hit me:

“You know me.
And You’re not disgusted.”

That night, I couldn’t sleep.
I just stared at the top of the tent and kept thinking:

“What if God really is like that?
What if He’s not waiting for me to fix myself before showing up?”

It didn’t erase my shame.
It didn’t solve everything.
But it cracked something open in me.

And that tiny crack —
it became a lifeline.

I didn’t leave camp perfect.
But I left… aware.
That maybe I wasn’t completely alone after all.

“Church is not a museum for saints, but a hospital for sinners.”
— Abigail Van Buren (Dear Abby)

After camp, I came back different.
I had that spark in me—tiny, but real.
I wanted to grow. To get better. To be whole.
I started reading scripture.
Waking up early to pray.
Trying to do “the right things.”

I thought maybe I could finally be… clean.

So I got involved in church.
Volunteered. Sat in the front. Took notes during sermons.
I wanted this to work.

But the more I tried,
the more I started to realize something:
no one really wanted to know me.
Not the real me.

They liked the version of me that showed up, smiled, served, raised hands.
But when I tried to talk about what was really going on—
the cycle I was stuck in, the guilt I carried, the pain I couldn’t explain—
I was met with… advice.

“Just stop.”
“Pray more.”
“Fast.”
“If you really loved God, you wouldn’t keep falling.”

No one asked, “Where does it hurt?”
They just asked, “Why aren’t you better yet?”

So I shut down.

I didn’t leave the church.
I just stopped speaking inside it.
I nodded when they talked. I played the part.
And slowly, I became two people.

Daytime me: holy, committed, careful.
Nighttime me: exhausted, ashamed, addicted.

The worst part wasn’t the sin.
It was the isolation.
The crushing silence where grace was supposed to be.

I started believing maybe God really was done with me.
Not because I hated Him—
but because I just couldn’t live up to what they said He expected.

So I stayed in the pews.
Still smiled.
Still lifted my hands.
But deep inside, I kept whispering:

“God, if You’re real…
please don’t let this be all there is.”

Chapter 5 — A Soul Burned Out

“Sometimes, we survive by numbing ourselves to life.”
— Brené Brown

After a while, I stopped trying to change.
Not out of rebellion.
Just exhaustion.

I still went to church.
Still served. Still prayed.
But nothing moved.
Nothing stirred.

I’d open my Bible and feel… nothing.
Not peace. Not conviction. Just silence.
I prayed, but it felt like I was talking into a locked room.
I was doing everything I was supposed to
and still drowning.

Eventually I stopped asking for help.
Stopped confessing.
Not because I didn’t need grace,
but because I stopped believing I was allowed to receive it.

I wasn’t angry at God.
I just felt like maybe He moved on.
Like He had other people to care for—
stronger ones.
Better ones.
Cleaner ones.

I wasn’t addicted anymore.
Not in the dramatic way.
I was just numb.
Disconnected from my own soul.

I didn’t cry.
I didn’t scream.
I just stared at ceilings a lot.
Lost track of days.
Ate when I remembered.
Slept because there was nothing else to do.

People still thought I was okay.
Maybe even “mature.”
Because I didn’t make a scene.
I showed up. I did the work.

But I was gone.
Emotionally. Spiritually.
Like a body running on automation.

At some point I realized—
I didn’t want to die.
But I really didn’t want to live like this either.

Chapter 6 — The Bottom and the Storm

“All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle.”
— St. Francis of Assisi

2023 didn’t start with a breakdown.
It started with routine.
Wake up. Work. Come home. Collapse. Repeat.

I wasn’t doing great, but I wasn’t falling apart either.
I thought maybe I could coast through this part of life—
quiet, invisible, under the radar.

Then it all came crashing down.

I was working for people I trusted.
People I knew.
People who knew me
my background, my struggles, my desire to just do things right.

I didn’t ask questions.
I didn’t want problems.
I just did what I was told.
Signed where they said to sign.
Moved where they asked me to go.

I didn’t know what I was part of.
Not really.
But one day, I got the call.
The kind that turns your blood cold.

“You need to come in. There’s an investigation. You’re involved.”

I was shocked. Confused. Embarrassed.
Then I realized:
They’d used me.
Not obviously.
But fully.

My name was on the papers.
My hands were on the work.
And now, my life was at risk.

There’s a case against me.
It’s ongoing. Real.
It doesn’t care about what I intended.
It only sees my name.

Some of my close friends know.
A few people online.
But that’s it.

Because how do you explain this?

How do you say,

“I didn’t mean to.
I wasn’t strong enough to ask more questions.
I trusted the wrong people at the worst time of my life.”

Now I live with the weight.
The fear.
The gnawing dread that one day they’ll tell me I have to go back, face court, face prison.

I don’t feel like a criminal.
But I do feel broken.

I don’t want sympathy.
I just want someone to understand that I didn’t choose this out of greed or malice.
I was just too tired to see it coming.

“You carry so much love in your heart. Give some to yourself.”
— R.Z.

I left.

Packed a bag, said goodbye to no one, and crossed a border.
I wasn’t running from something.
I was running through it.
Trying to outrun a version of myself that already felt sentenced,
even before any court date was set.

Now I live in another country.
Alone.
Quiet.
Invisible.

I work 11-hour shifts, six days a week.
The kind of work that keeps your body moving so your mind doesn’t wander.
But mine still does.
Late at night.
Early in the morning.
On the bus.
In the hallway.
At lunch, staring at my hands like they belong to someone else.

People here don’t know what’s happening.
They see a quiet, hard-working guy.
They don’t know I go to sleep every night wondering:

“What if tomorrow they tell me to come back?”
“What if the papers are signed?”
“What if this ends in prison?”

Some friends know.
Online people who’ve stuck around long enough to ask how I’m really doing.
But I don’t tell everyone.
Because I don’t have the energy to explain that I’m not guilty
just broken.

I miss home.
But I don’t know where that is anymore.
I don’t feel safe here.
I didn’t feel safe there.
And the worst part is knowing:

Wherever I go, I carry this version of myself with me.

The version that trusted too easily.
That was too tired to fight.
That didn’t ask the right questions.
That stayed silent too long.

Some days, I wonder if I’m being punished.
Other days, I wonder if I’m just… forgotten.

Chapter 8 — Whispering. On the Edge. Still Alive.

“The wound is the place where the Light enters you.”
— Rumi

I didn’t plan to share this.
I honestly thought I’d stay quiet forever.
Live alone, work long hours, carry this thing with me until the end.

But silence doesn’t heal.
It rots.
And eventually, it either buries you—
or breaks open and lets something new breathe through the cracks.

So here I am.
Speaking.
Not loudly.
Not confidently.
Just… honestly.

I’m not telling this to get pity.
I’m not trying to be dramatic or inspiring.
I’m not posting for attention.

I’m writing this because I don’t want to disappear.
Because maybe somewhere out there,
someone else is holding their breath under the weight of things they can’t say.

If that’s you
I want you to know you’re not crazy.
You’re not disgusting.
You’re not beyond repair.

You’re just tired.
Like me.

I don’t know what happens next.
I still wake up wondering if today’s the day I’ll be called back.
I still go to work wondering how long this version of me can keep going.

But I’m still here.

And honestly?
That’s a miracle in itself.

And one more thing
through all of this: the addiction, the numbness, the religious exhaustion, the silence, the case, the fear…

God didn’t walk away.
He just didn’t show up how I expected.

He wasn’t lightning.
He wasn’t fire.
He was just there.
In the quiet.
In the breath I didn’t think I’d take.
In the line I didn’t think I’d write.
In the grace I still don’t feel I deserve.

I used to think I had to fight my way back to Him.

Now I think He never moved.

I don’t understand Him.
But I know this:
If I’m still alive, it’s not because I was strong.
It’s because He never let go.

If you’ve read this far — thank you.

This wasn’t easy to write.
And honestly, it’s not easy to live either.
But if anything in this story made you feel less alone,
or gave you language for something you’ve been holding in silence
then maybe none of it was wasted.

And if you’re still struggling,
just know:
You’re not invisible.
You’re not too far gone.
You’re not alone.

I’m still here.
And so are you.

With peace
Elisha

1k8gtgo,1745684612.0,2025-04-26 16:23:32,TrueOffMyChest,My ex-girlfriend (F26) SAed me (M24) almost 2 years ago,"This is going to be a little disorganized. I've been consistently thinking about sharing my story for months on an anonymous post just to see peoples' thoughts, but I just never had the motivation until now.

The ages I posted are our current ages, but this all took place in 2023.

Just to make it easier to follow, I'll call my ex-gf Ivy. I had recently turned 23 and she was 25.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] giving a lot of background and the whole story, just so things make sense. This is probably not the most interesting read, but it's real.

I never really had much luck with dating apps. I did have a couple of relationships from outside of dating apps that were mostly in high school, but nothing ever lasted long. I mostly focused on academics during college and also just did not feel like putting myself out there. Maybe I would have some decent luck if I had some decent pictures of me since I am [REDACTED_NAME] bad at taking pictures of myself and I think I look better now than I have at any point earlier in my life, at least when I actually get decent sleep and do not let my beard grow past like two days.

To this day, the longest relationship that I've ever had is 5 months and that was when I was 16-17. My self esteem and sense of self worth were really bad, and I had been suffering from depression as well as both generalized and social anxiety since I was 15. All of these were factors in why I was so eager to jump into a relationship.

It started off with me and Ivy talking over hinge in the summer of 2023.  I was super invested in her just because she seemed somewhat into me early on and actually replied to me. We started off just talking about movies and hobbies and just spent hours going into conversation as we progressed through the talking stage for the first week or so. I do not remember the exact timeframe, but I think it was a week and a half. I felt a sense of surprise from only talking to Ivy in single messages at a time to long conversations with her. It was difficult to read as good or bad. I was nervous, because she suddenly seemed so interested in talking to me and was super eager to talk.

Within 2 days of talking more consistently, she asked for my number and we just talked through texts. We talked about our interests, life experiences, politics, and found ourselves agreeing with each other a lot and growing more invested in each other. That part was fun, and I had the time to text for hours.

I was not working while awaiting a start date for a decent job offer I had accepted several months earlier. Well, the job offer pay wasn't amazing, but decent for a fairly recent graduate of college who was struggling with job applications earlier.

About two weeks into that talking face, Ivy had a revelation for me. Before we made things more official, she had something to tell me because she felt it was not fair for me to enter a relationship not knowing her full history. She was previously manipulated by her ex-boyfriend at the age of 18 to engage in amateur sex-work that would be filmed. The arrangement involved her filming with strangers to financially provide for him. She explained that she regretted it and only did it because her self-esteem was low and she was worried about her boyfriend at the time. I do not remember the full conversation just because I was just in shock. I felt sick for a day but still talked to her somewhat during that time.

Back then, I was the type of guy to say a partner's past did not matter remotely to me based on my own beliefs. I told her I was okay with it. I genuinely believed it at the time, but looking back, the fact that I was so sick from that news was proof I should not have gone further.

We got more affectionate and intimate in our conversations, but they were just that, conversations. I did not have a car at the time, so driving to a girlfriend while I lived with my parents, who are not accepting of dating due to religion, was a bad idea. I was very emotionally attached to her and got excited to hear from her every day.

My job was eventually going to start in the fall with me moving out to a city that's within hours driving distance but still not close to my parents' house. I won't get too into detail about my job, but it is a corporate position for a very big company. I had an introductory period for a week where I got flown out on a trip in a corporate office out of state, and I facetimed Ivy the whole time when I wasn't doing work-related stuff or sleeping. Between that and texting, we had to be in communication for at least 7 hours a day and it was even higher when I was not working.

A week after that, I started at the building I was assigned to and get trained effectively before actually doing my position. During that training, I was only able to text Ivy for like 5 minutes at a time a few times throughout the day (maybe like 40-50 minutes total). I also found out I was being placed on night shift starting the next week. During that week, I noticed my girlfriend growing distant when I got home and was able to spend more time talking to her.

We did make plans to eat together and then spend time at her place during the weekend following this period. We did it, but my memory of all of that is nearly blank outside of waking up in her house on a Saturday morning. I woke up and had this weird aura with her. It felt felt like she was trying to get me out of there fast.

We talked a little bit over text during the rest of the weekend, but she admitted that with me working on night shift and not being able to talk to her as much, she was losing interest and starting to view me platonically. I felt weird, so I did not fight for the relationship. I gave her an out to just end the relationship, and she agreed. I asked her to not contact me again and cut all contact with her and stated that I would be doing so in my last message. I have done this in almost all of my break-ups due to discomfort around exes after one particular high school ex treated me poorly and nearly ruined my life.

I did not really think much of the relationship outside of ""wow nights broke me up"" and ""my girlfriend was kinda weird"" until months later in the winter. I was drinking with coworkers at a restaurant after we did a training out of city. I had sudden memories of Ivy touching me in a half-awake state and having sex me while I was barely conscious. There was only one night where that could have happened. Despite being buzzed, I acted like a sad drunk and my coworkers viewed it as ""the young guy is a lightweight and had too much to drink"".

I was scared and upset upon realizing that Ivy raped me and I was too stupid and unaware to do anything about it. I had cut mentally blocked so much of Ivy out that I could not even remember her last name, and the last thing I'd want is to reach out to my rapist to get more info on her to report her. I am 99% sure we were drinking together and that she put something in my drink. That would explain why I had no memory of even going to her place or meeting with her before that awkward wake up. And it would explain why I hadn't remembered until that point. I do not drink that often, and when I do, it is only a single beer that goes well with my burger or Taco Bell.

I could not think of why she had done such a thing until I remembered a conversation I had with her. She was very into astrology and viewed it as a legitimate thing to use to judge people, especially relationships. She said something about my Zodiac signs that was weird.

Somehow, multiple planets being the same sign showed that my personality was a red flag and that I could be toxic and a horrible person at worst. Other women online reported stories of having negative experiences with men of my sign. She did not outright call me a bad person for these, but showed disappointment and said it was a red flag. That should have been a fucking red flag for me.

I did end up dating another woman from summer 2024 to fall 2024 for about 2 months. I think I found her very cute and charming at first, but in retrospect, I think I liked her because she was very different from my ex. I unconsciously ""overcorrected"" to avoid making the same mistake

She was sweet and caring, but I was her first boyfriend and she had no experience in any sense. No, we didn't end up becoming intimate. We didn't have much in common.

It felt very difficult to have long conversations with her or truly open up to her, because we had different outlooks on life.

I work a lot of hours at my job and being on night shift conflicted with her own schedule where she worked during the day time.

Her communication was terrible, but she eventually dumped me over text the night after we met for the first time after having a 2 week long gap without seeing each other, and it just felt off. Instead of admitting there was something wrong, she said she was fine and then proceeded to talk about a book she liked for over an hour. I had 3 hours of sleep that day, so my filter was lower, and I insulted the book.

I feel bad about hurting her and wish her the best, but I should not have been dating her.

I think I dated her just for the sake of being in a relationship, and I lacked self-awareness to not see it as such. That was an immature thing to do, and I don't think I will ever do the same again. It's not fair to myself or whoever I date.

I haven't dated since but that's more due to work hours increasing, night shift struggles, a car accident, and the distance from friends/family. Several people in my life have also died, and the grief that comes along with that has made me lose motivation for dating at the moment.

The hardest loss was my best friend seven months ago, and I don't think I can get over that loss so easily. He was basically a brother to me.

I think I should be in the right headspace before making any decisions regarding relationships.

I like the validation my job gives me though. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] better at it than a lot of other people. I'm [REDACTED_NAME]-respected for my competence. I get introduced to all sorts of people I never would have met otherwise. And it helped me get over my 8+ year depression and anxiety. Surviving in a high stakes corporate environment has shown me how strong I am. Losing the bit of extra weight that I wanted gone has also boosted my confidence.

One thing I'll say about my rapist. I still know her instagram handle. I have looked at it a few times. It is fucked up of me to say this, but wow, she gained a lot of weight after we broke up and her new boyfriends are not great looking great either. There's also a lot of pictures of them doing drugs, and no wonder they all look horrible.

I do not know the context, but seeing my rapist not look great has made me feel vindicated. I hate that I have become such a spiteful and hateful person, judging people off of some pictures. But I do think she deserves to be miserable

I miss my old sense of idealism and optimistic, where I would just see the good in people and would not be so judgmental of people because of their pasts, but I have changed a lot, probably for the worst.

This was probably horribly written, but writing out the story of my trauma after working a full night shift has made my writing skills impaired. I'll answer questions or give any needed clarification after getting some sleep.",1
1kl4d3q,1747084783.0,2025-05-12 21:19:43,TrueOffMyChest,I think I just realized I'm the unattractive one in my open marriage.,"My wife and I have a solid marriage. We have 4 kids, (one adopted, 2 from her previous marriage and one bio child that's ours). We can talk about anything and there isn't any issues with our marriage. I acknowledge that this issue is mine and mine alone. 

We opened up our marriage and have had several fun experiences where she was able to try damn near everything on her sexual bucket list and I was more than happy to facilitate it and make sure she had a safe fun time. 


Now it's been my turn to find someone else to play with and the rejection has been brutal. People will reply to my FetLife posts, see my wife in the pictures we have together and then they will reject me and then ask ""is your wife open for play?"" 

This has been every experience. Male or female.  People find out I'm [REDACTED_NAME], reject me, and want my wife instead. 

It's been absolutely brutal to my self esteem and it makes me feel like a fucking loser and it's definitely not what I want out of this experience. And I feel so fucking narcissistic when I hear my thoughts say ""So are you really complaining that you only are going to fuck your hot wife for the rest of your life?"" Like what the fuck is wrong with me. 

How the hell do people do this nowadays? I never thought I'd be the ugly husband. 

I thought being bisexual would mean more opportunities for fun and adventure but all I've seen is twice the rejection. 

My wife has been wonderful through all this but she thinks I feel unloved. Fuck no! I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in love! I just feel like The dad from American Beauty and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this husk of the man I used to be. Funny, charming, always making people laugh. Now I just seem like a joke.

I don't even know what I should do from this point on.

1gb02fj,1729768348.0,2024-10-24 11:12:28,TrueOffMyChest,"I ""woke up"" when I was 12 years old.","I woke up when I was 12.

When I was a child, strange things would happen to me. I was constantly sick with fevers and flus. I feel it's important to preface with this since it could possibly explain some of the things, but not all of them.

 I had a small tube TV in the room next to my bedroom, I called it the toy room because I had an easel, desk, casette deck et cetera in there. I repeatedly woke up sitting in a chair in front of my TV, not remembering walking there. It lasted for about a year when I was 5-6.

 When I was about 7 years old I remember standing up out of bed and suddenly being in the middle of a field near my house in my underwear in a heavy rain storm. I walked home since it was only a block away and all the doors of my house were locked, I had to knock to be let in. I remember my parents' shock and disbelief. They always denied it happened and seemed to have no memory of it after that night, but when my mom passed in 2019 I read her old journals she left to me and she wrote it down in 2003! They just genuinely didn't seem to remember it even the next day, even til the day she died. My dad still claims not to remember!

Around this time I started having terrible dreams, waking up groaning and crying, unable to remember them. I genuinely felt like there was something coming into my room and putting the dreams into my head. They stopped abruptly one day and I haven't had a single dream since then. 

Between the ages of 8-10 I would frequently have out-of-body experiences where I would see myself from different viewpoints. Sometimes it was like an over-the-shoulder 3rd person perspective, other times it would be a view from above. It was genuinely all I could see, I couldn't see out of my eyes but only through this odd perspective. I thought I would be seen as crazy if I tried to tell anyone so I just kept quiet and tried not to think about it. It happened occasionally as I got older but 

From 10-12, I have no memories. None. My parents claimed I just kind of stopped talking, stopped interacting with people, stopped doing anything at all. They said I was like a ghost just existing and emotionless, robotic and silent unless asked a question. I failed all of my classes and was nearly put into special Ed.

Then one day when I was about 12 I just.. woke up. No more weird sicknesses, no more sleepwalking (or teleporting I guess?), no more weird dissociating, nightmares, robotic behavior, paranormal experiences, nothing. I started remembering things normally, experiencing normal pre-teen feelings, everything just kind of started being ""okay"".

I don't even know why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this but it just crossed my mind and felt weird. Any explanations or insights, even just comments or shared experiences would be awesome. Thanks for reading.

1b1ca56,1709041765.0,2024-02-27 13:49:25,TrueOffMyChest,I’ve only just realized that I let the men I call my family and friends ruin my marriage    ,"

I’ve been divorced for almost 2 years and a few weeks ago my father (67m), my 2 brothers (37m&40m) and 4 friends (35m,37m,38,41m) while very drunk joked about how they can’t believe I left my wife. They said that they all tried to get with her since the divorce but she had repeatedly rejected them, saying it would be inappropriate and unkind to do such a thing to me.

I laughed at what they were saying just to ease them into saying more and once they thought I found it funny they really opened up. They had all purposely made me feel paranoid about my ex-wife cheating on me, and using me because why would a woman like her be with a man like me if it wasn’t for the money I made? They often hinted at or sometimes even directly said that she wore the pants in the relationship and that she was only with me because I’m easily manipulated. They constantly planted negative things into my mind. If I went to talk with them about something happening in my relationship they would put a negative twist to it or they’d purposely give me bad advice. Then when I lost my job during covid they all hinted at how she’s definitely cheating now that there’s no financial benefit in being faithful to me. I obviously trusted them and often took their words to heart and it ruined my marriage. 

I frequently argued with my wife and I was always accusing her of something or suspecting her of not really loving me. I questioned everything that was between us. I often told her bullshit things like how I’m a high value man and that she needed to appreciate me and when I was not working for 6 months I flipped the script and started accusing her of not respecting me for not working. I was unappreciative of all her hard work and for being the one who took care of our household bills and any other bill during those six months of unemployment. I continued to let their words drive me into paranoia and I started accusing her of cheating with her co-workers. 

Eventually my wife had enough of my moods, constant mistrust and accusations. She left me and to be honest for a long time it felt like it came out of nowhere and so I had myself convinced she left me for another man.

Now here I am [REDACTED_NAME] that every man I’ve called my family, my friend were all my enemies who I let destroy my marriage. I obviously lost my mind once they were done telling me all the ways they conspired to ruin my marriage, and we did get to blows. I’ve cut off all contact with each and everyone of them. 

I want to reach out to my ex and make amends and hopefully get her back. My ex-wife has agreed to meet up with me and she doesn’t know exactly what I want to discuss with her and I don’t know how to go about making amends and hopefully mending our relationship. How do I tell her how much I regret everything and that I want her to give me a second chance? Is there even a chance for us? 


Edit: Some of y’all keep saying “you took the words of your friends over your wife’s” and I don’t think that’s a to fair or complete assessment. I trusted my father and brothers. My father was the main driving force behind this manipulation campaign and it’s not often that your entire family is conspiring against you. And not only your family but also your friends. 

I’m not running away from accepting the fact that it is wholly my fault in how my marriage ended. I take ownership of that. I take ownership of the fact that I accused my wife of being a cheater or a user. I regret it all.

If my ex-wife doesn’t accept my apology. I would accept it gracefully. If she said she never wanted to talk to me or ever get back together I’d also accept it. I would not stand in the way and I would not try to change her mind. I would wish her well and leave her be. ",4849
t8yvly,1646685572.0,2022-03-07 20:39:32,TrueOffMyChest,I think my dad might’ve killed someone when i was a kid.,"One night, when I (36f) was about 8 or 9 years old, (mid 90’s), my father took my little brother and I to Blockbuster to pick out movies. We left there and my dad stopped at a corner store for some snacks and he parked on the side of the building. He left me and my brother in the car while he ran in. On his way out, a man came up behind him and held something to his side. My dad, pretended he was going to hand the man his wallet, but he instead elbowed the man in his face and he fell to the ground. The guy got up and came at my dad with a knife and my dad fought it away from him and stabbed him with it. It was long and that shit went all the way in. The guy let out this horrible groan. I can still hear it. He left the guy on the floor writhing, hopped in the car and took off. 

For so many years I thought this was a dream until my little brother mentioned it to me when asking if I remembered. We’ve NEVER brought this up to my father, ever. I’ve always wondered what happened to that guy, but this was way before cell phones and stuff so who knows. It’s crazy the weight that comes off of someone when they say things they’ve always been holding in.",45241

She has since died and this is the only item that I have from her.

Teddy sits on a cabinet that is next to the bed so he is always looking down on us. It's symbolic for me as it makes me feel like my gran is always looking out for me.

My girlfriend has always teased me about Teddy but I never minded. I understand how it's not usual for a grown adult to keep stuffed animals in their room.

I came back and found Teddy missing. I looked everywhere but I knew that he wouldn't have moved on his own. When I asked my her she said that she threw him out while she was cleaning up because I am [REDACTED_NAME] old to own toys. She also found it weird that he was just always there looking at us while we slept.

I admit that I probably overreacted but I told her to leave and not come back unless she had Teddy with her. She went to her mom's and has not come back so Teddy is gone for good.",17283
yjhtut,1667329395.0,2022-11-01 19:03:15,TrueOffMyChest,I just recently realized the legitimate strength difference between men and women and I don’t know how to feel,"My (18F) lovely boyfriend (18M) and I were cuddling in bed together before I started goofing off and tickling him (he’s a lot more ticklish than I am [REDACTED_NAME] I have the advantage). He was laughing talking about how it was unfair and how I should stop and I did the whole “make me” kinda thing and then we started play wrestling. 

I grew up with only sisters while he’s grown up with three brothers so he’s much better than I at that sort of thing, but I think I was shocked how easily he was able to keep me pinned. I trust my boyfriend wholeheartedly and don’t think he’d ever do anything to hurt me, and even when he was pinning me down, he was giving me cute forehead kisses and stuff, so it was definitely a positive playful moment between us. 

I still find it intimidating that strength difference is so blatant, I work out and I’m decently in shape but that didn’t mean anything in regards to me holding my own. 

I’m slightly conflicted too, because part of me is intimidated by the concept of men basically always being stronger as a whole and part of me is strangely excited that my boyfriend specifically is strong. It’s probably an Ooga booga cavewoman thing about the idea of feeling protected or something, idk

But yeah, I didn’t have anyone I could share this with irl, so thank you for listening to my rant

Edit: to those of you saying stuff like “it took you 18 years to figure this out??” I understood it, i cognitively understood that statistically men are physically stronger than women but I didn’t feel that difference myself, or internalize that idea until recently",12756

We’ve been friendly but there’s always been a level of attraction present that I’m just realizing was sexual. I wanted her and she wanted me and neither of us knew it could understand that that’s what it was.

Well she may have I didn’t. Every Friday my office goes out for beers and she tagged along for the first time. She stuck next to me the entire night and I just couldn’t help but notice how amazing she looks. I have never been sexually attracted to a woman before like I am [REDACTED_NAME].

We stayed late and both had a few more drinks than we should’ve. We talked and finally she asked me if I would come home and spend the night with her. Then I finally understood why I had been so interested in her.

I have a wife at home. I have 2 daughters. I have a family and responsibilities to all of them and I’m here chopping it up with a woman who might be a fun sexy escape but is nothing compared to the mother of my children and life partner.

I had been letting this friendship grow. Letting this pure animalistic lust grow in the both of us. I entertained the idea, “maybe if we just do it once”, “no one has to know” and more.

In that moment I told her she was very nice, but I have a partner who I can’t betray. I called an Uber and went home and slept it off.",35359
1gx36uh,1732263908.0,2024-11-22 08:25:08,TrueOffMyChest,Where I come from.,"My name is **Ethan Marshall**. I was born in **Lakeside City** to my beautiful mother, **Rebecca Lynn**, and my father, **James Marshall**. I was raised in **Riverside**, though my childhood was spent moving between different places with my mom. My early life was turbulent, marked by difficult experiences with my father, who was abusive toward my mother. I witnessed this abuse firsthand.

After I was born, we lived on **Maple Ridge Reservation**. When I was about one year old, my uncle **David** burned down our home, forcing us to relocate. My mother escaped with me and my two sisters, **Mia** and **Olivia**, and we stayed at a women’s shelter in **Northvale** for a short time. My mom left Maple Ridge to escape my father for good, but he followed us, making it unsafe. Eventually, we moved to Riverside, where a child welfare agency helped us find a small apartment.

We lived in that apartment for about five years before my father found us again. He showed up uninvited, angry at my mom for leaving him. Only a week after his return, he brought friends over and started drinking heavily. That night, I vividly remember him throwing beer bottles at my mom while his friends held me back from intervening. The police were called, and he was arrested. He received additional charges after drugs and a loaded handgun were found in the house. He went to jail for three years.

Although my mom was finally safe, she couldn’t care for us during that time, so my siblings and I were placed in foster care. I lived with three different families between the ages of 9 and 13, and only one of those families still feels like family to me today.

When I was 11, we reunited with my mom, who had met a new man named **Rick**. Before Rick, she had briefly dated a man named **Danny** while trying to move on from my father. Rick eventually decided to relocate us to **Hillford**. I felt a mix of sadness about leaving Riverside and excitement for a new start.

In Hillford, we moved into a larger apartment and settled in. I attended the local elementary school and made friends, some of whom I still keep in touch with today. When I was 13, I moved to a different school, as our grades were divided into 1–6 and 7–12. Starting high school was nerve-wracking, but I made some valuable friends.

Those years were filled with campfires in the woods and smoking pot on warm summer nights. I thought I was just having fun, but looking back, I was being reckless and wasting time. When COVID hit in 2020, I became heavily dependent on marijuana, isolated myself, and fell further behind in school.

At 15, I started talking to a girl named **Kara** through Snapchat. At the time, I was in a dark place, and having someone who listened and cared meant a lot to me. We quickly grew close and eventually started a relationship. Though we were long-distance, it felt like a miracle when she moved back to Hillford.

We met in person for the first time in January 2022, but soon after, Kara told me she was going to rehab for three months. I was devastated and became obsessed with her absence, which I now realize was unhealthy. About a month and a half into her rehab stay, I drank alcohol for the first time. That night, I blacked out and made out with another girl, who recorded it. When Kara got out, she found out through an anonymous source.

In retaliation, she cheated on me with another man. Her betrayal devastated me, and I fell into a deep depression, even contemplating suicide. Despite everything, we eventually got back together.

At 16, my stepdad Rick told us we were losing our apartment. I had to decide whether to stay in Hillford or move back to Riverside with my mom, as Rick was leaving her. Feeling lost, I chose to go with my mom. We couch-surfed for a while until we found an apartment in a neighborhood I wasn’t familiar with. Isolated, struggling with alcohol, and without my girlfriend nearby, I hit rock bottom.

Eventually, Kara moved to Riverside for a while, but she left again within a year. I realized then that I didn’t need her anymore and decided to focus on myself. Around that time, I was hit with a charge I don’t want to discuss. Afraid I might end up in jail, I started drinking again to cope.

During this time, I grew closer to my friend **Lily**. What started as a casual connection turned into a relationship three months after Kara left. Lily moved in with my mom and me, and we supported each other through difficult times.

On June 3, 2023, when I was 17, my mother had a stroke and passed away. Losing her was the lowest point in my life. She was my anchor, my everything, and I felt like I had lost all reason to live. During this dark time, I tried LSD for the first time, which led to an ego death that helped me process my grief and accept my mom’s passing.

After sorting through her belongings, Lily and I decided not to stay in the apartment because it held too many memories. We moved into her apartment, where I currently live. 

At 18, I’ve already experienced more than most people do in a lifetime. My journey has been filled with hardship, loss, and mistakes, but also resilience and growth. Losing my mom was the most devastating thing I’ve ever faced. She was my rock, my guiding light, and the person who always fought to give me and my sisters a better life despite everything we endured.

Every day, I carry her memory with me. I know she wouldn’t want me to give up. I’ve learned that life isn’t about running from your past or your pain—it’s about facing it, growing from it, and using it to build a stronger future.

To anyone who’s taken the time to hear my story, thank you. Sharing it helps me remember where I came from and how far I’ve come. I may not have all the answers, and I’m still figuring things out, but I’m determined to keep going—not just for myself, but for the people I’ve loved and lost. My past has shaped me, but it doesn’t define me. This is just the beginning of my story, and I know brighter days are ahead.

t3782c,1646023791.0,2022-02-28 04:49:51,TrueOffMyChest,My boyfriend makes me hate my 2 months postpartum body and he doesn't even realize it,"Me walking over to fridge, sees my BF looking at me with weird expression:""What?""

BF:""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sitting here thinking 'damn, I picked *that.*""

Me:""What do you mean?""

BF:*imitating my walking* ""Like this, stomach out, boobs down to here...ass sticking out like you're a baby with a full diaper.""

Me: ...

BF:""At least the underwear holds your ass up.""

I'm 2 months postpartum, and while I've lost all the baby weight, I know that 1. My boobs got ridiculously huge during pregnancy. 2. Breastfeeding has made them not perky anymore. I also know that my degenerating spinal condition probably makes my walk a little funky looking. 

But all I could do was sit there in disbelief, tell him it was mean, and go back to eating my salad. I was confused because he'd been coming onto me not thirty seconds prior when he saw the underwear on me. I thought he was joking, or saying that he couldn't believe he ""picked *that*"" because of my attitude or messy hair or some other dumb shit.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to the store in the morning to buy some extra hoodies and pajama pants. I need to do laundry so I thought I was safe walking around in just underwear and a tank top, but I guess I was wrong. It's like me losing all of the baby weight plus a few pounds in 2 months time wasn't good enough for him. 

I wish I could get a reduction or a lift. He doesn't realize though that if I have another kid, it'll undo the effects of a reduction or a lift. Yet he tells me how I could use a breast lift.

idk. I feel shitty about my body. I want to be intimate with him. I remember how much lust we had in the start of the relationship, how obsessed he was with my body and only bringing up the positives. I never put effort into taking good nudes until I met him, because he ate them up and worshipped my curves.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to pretend that I have the perfect body, and yes couples should be honest with each other, but I feel like there's a line that a man shouldn't cross when talking to his girlfriend about her body's flaws. Especially when she's two months postpartum. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this all out. I feel like horse shit. I probably look like horse shit too. Literally the only things wrong with me are my breasts and my posture. There's not anything I can do for my posture with how bad my spine is, but hopefully one day I can get a lift or a reduction. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] 153 pounds (I weighed about 153-156 before I got pregnant) so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to do my best not to go above 160. I don't want him to be able to use my weight against me too.",15824
1golube,1731306204.0,2024-11-11 06:23:24,TrueOffMyChest,Manipulator or Monster. My actions haunt me to this day.,"To start off, this happened a few years ago, when I (Now 32M) was in my early 20s at a house party. Cheap booze, drinking games, gossip and so on. As one after the other left, only three people remained. My best friend, my first crush and myself. A piece of history between the three of us: I first confessed to her out of nowhere when I was 16, got rejected, then got angry and wanting to know why she rejected me, trying to convince her for months. Yes, I was THAT guy. The typical cringe inducing wannabe ""Nice Guy"" who cannot handle a rejection and then finally got a well-deserved: ""look for someone on your level"" from her (This will be important later). It was a wake-up call that made me change my behaviour. Meanwhile my best friend was her first crush, but he was already taken. So that was the dynamic of our group.

Noticing how late it was, she asked my friend if she can stay the night, because the last train left an hour ago, to which my best friend obviously agreed. Letting her walk home, for more than an hour, through the night is out of the question. When I wanted to go home, my best friend pulled me to the side, asking if I can stay too. We were all a bit more than tipsy, so to ensure that nothing happens, he wanted me to stay too.

So, there we are, in the same bed. My best mate constructed a barricade of pillows and blankets between himself and us two, falling asleep within a few minutes. She was between the two of us and I, fully dressed in a sweater and jogging pants, pressed against the wall.

While he slept right away, she was rather restless ... I am [REDACTED_NAME] not sure why I felt that way, but it seemed to me like she needed someone to lean on, so I put my arm below her pillow as she got up and laid down again, brushing up against me. I thought nothing of it, and though it would calm her down if I hugged her and nothing more. But I noticed two things: First, my hand was on her chest and second, something I did not notice before due to me being fully clothed: She undressed when she stood back up before, down to her underwear. I froze up as she turned to look at me, getting closer. It felt ... wrong ... like this was not supposed to be like that. After a while I moved my hand on her belly and just left it there, I needed to think, but she moved it further down and I went on auto pilot. Should I stop? Am I allowed to stop? Would it hurt her feelings if I did? I began feeling as if I was no longer in my own body. It was a strange sensation, akin to me standing next to the bed, looking down at myself. But that does not excuse my actions. I could have pulled my hand away at any time ... I just didn't. Afterwards, she brushed up against my still fully clothed body. I wrapped my arms around her and stayed that way until I was sure she was asleep and then turned around.

The next day was awkward. She did not say anything about it, but there was this tension and the obvious fact that she woke up nearly undressed between us. As she left, my friend asked me if something happened between us and a scary thought came to mind: ... did she think that I was my best friend back then? I wanted to talk with her. At first, she avoided me, but a few days later, she told me to just text her what I wanted to talk about.

So I told her that ""something"" happened between us that night. But I was too vague ... on my train ride home from work, she replied that she could not remember anything of that night, saying how could I do anything, as I could only reply with one apology after another. I exited the train and ran through the city to my best friends flat, having an absolute mental breakdown in his bathroom. After about two hours of vomit-crying, my friend called my father, who drove me home. Trying to comfort me, even though I do not deserve such.

The next day, I wrote her, that I would like to meet with her, to explain in detail what exactly happened and then let her judge me. She agreed, but said to meet up the next day. Only to postpone it one day after another. And in hindsight it is understandable, that she did not want to see me. But to me, it felt as if I was being kept from explaining the entire situation and each day it felt worse and worse, until after a week I blew up on her. I wrote in detail what happened, that I did not feel comfortable, but in my anger ended it with an insult and repeating what she said to me all these years ago: That I perhaps really should look for someone on my level. It was incredibly unfair of me to dig up an old wound for a petty insult ... I immediately apologized, but the damage was done, as she responded that she did not realize those words stuck for all these years and would like to meet up that day, and let me tell her in person what happened.

So, I did. We met at a café, I apologized for the insult and we talked a bit. She said what I told her happened made sense to her, and how she was unaware that I was still a virgin. Asking if she could ""change that"". And this is when I realized what I have just done. I manipulated her into feeling sorry for me and put her in a lose-lose situation. I still have not changed; I was still ""That Guy"" from way back when. I declined and we went to a local bar to continue talking. She seemed to take the entire situation rather lightly, joked how it must have been hard for me to lay next to her without mauling her, and wanted me to tell her what precisely happened, one step at a time. We each ordered a drink and went through the entire night, we laughed at my shyness, we joked about her offer again and I realized: She was serious. And I started to think again: Am I allowed to reject this advance? If I say no: that would hurt her feelings. Am I allowed to accept it? Was this out of pity? Does she just ignore that I ... assaulted her? Just so I feel better? I did not earn this!

I told her I would love to, but I had no protection, so I brought her to the nearest train station and we agreed that we go to a club together the next day, but this time I should come prepared.

I did not see any out here. Did I just manipulate her into pity-sex? It just gets worse each time we meet. No, I needed to find a way to prevent it, without rejecting her. I had to make a fool out of myself. So I hatched a plan. Meet up with her. Let her stay with her friends the entire time so she is safe. Do not make any advances. Make it awkward for me. And as a final safety net: Drink enough to ensure nothing could happen, just in case. So, I went to the club with her and a few friends of hers, stayed around, talked with her and her friends, while downing shots and then: Blackout.

After that night, we agreed that doing ""it"" would be a bad idea and we stayed in contact for a few years, met a few times, but slowly drifted apart. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to no longer play a role in her life. It is better that way and I only wish her the best.

I took the consequences of my actions, vowing to make sure I could not do this to anyone else. Only if I can be sure that I am [REDACTED_NAME] a monster, could I accept any advance from somebody. I do not want to manipulate anyone, even accidentally or even worse: repeating what I did that night. I reflect on that fateful party every night, for 8 years now ...

And that is my story. What I did was wrong. To me: there is little doubt about that. Even if she did not make it out to be that bad: I still do. The only thing I wish to know is this: If I am [REDACTED_NAME] a manipulator, who caught himself before things became worse, or am I a monster, that should never be trusted.

TL;DR  
I believe I assaulted a friend of mine, then insulted her. She forgave me and offered to take my virginity. I indirectly refused and after realising I nearly manipulate her into pity-sex: got blackout drunk to make sure nothing could happen. And to this day, I don't know if I am ""just"" a bad person that avoided doing the worst, or if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] redemption ...",1

People wished me a happy birthday (the standard ""happy birthday text/Facebook wall post, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for that) but no one came to hang with me to just eat (multiple people were invited). I don't expect gifts, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] old to throw a fit but it's difficult not to feel the goddamn void of people when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] eating alone in my apartment, especially after two days ago we just celebrated another friend's birthday, with a surprise birthday party(we're all vaccinated), gifts and drinking.

1kvfy31,1748215286.0,2025-05-25 23:21:26,TrueOffMyChest,People don’t even realize how cruel they are to the homeless. Or maybe they do. It's dehumanizing.,"I'm [REDACTED_NAME] homeless. I do my best to stay clean, keep myself together, and not be a burden to anyone. I do everything I can to keep myself clean and put together. I find showers when I can, I keep what clothes I have in as good a condition as possible. I don’t panhandle. I don’t loiter. I don’t leave trash behind. I don’t leave messes. I don’t cause problems. I’m polite. I buy what I can, when I can. I’m just trying to survive.

But the second people find out I’m homeless, or think I might be, everything changes.

Gas stations and restaurants I’ve gone to for months suddenly tell me I “can’t use the restroom, it’s policy.” Funny how that policy didn’t exist before they noticed I came in regularly or saw me carrying a bag past the store one day. I’ve been treated like a regular customer, even welcomed, until someone puts it together. I’m not allowed in anymore. Not because of something I did, but because I came in too often and had a bag with me. That’s it. That’s all it takes to stop being seen as a customer and start being treated like a problem. Then I’m just “the homeless one” and suddenly not welcome.

Store employees follow me around like I’m going to steal something. I carry my bag because it has everything I own in it. That doesn’t mean I’m a thief. I’ve *never* stolen a thing. I only get what I can afford. But the way they look at me... suspicious, disgusted, like I’m something to be dealt with...They eye my bag like I’m about to steal something, even though I never have. I only ever pick up what I can pay for. It’s humiliating. It’s like I stop being a person in their eyes.

And I notice the difference between how people treat me when they don’t know me, versus when they do. People who used to smile or say “have a good one” now act like I’m invisible. Or worse, like I’m dangerous. I’ve seen people look at me with disgust. Not anger, disgust. The kind you don’t even realize is on your face. Like I’m contagious. Like I did something to deserve this.

One time, a Jersey Mike’s worker looked me in the eye and said, *“You people aren’t allowed in here.”* I just stood there stunned. I wasn’t loud. I wasn’t begging. I wasn’t causing any problems. I was just trying to come in like anyone else. But because I had a bag and didn’t ""look the part,"" I was treated like trash. Like, I’m not even part of the same world as everyone else.

I’m still human. Being homeless doesn’t make me dirty, worthless, or a threat. I’m just struggling. And it hurts more than people realize, because it’s not just about lacking shelter, it’s about being constantly reminded that, to most people, you don’t matter once you fall through the cracks.

You don’t have to give me money. You don’t have to offer help. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] asking for either. But basic decency? Respect? A neutral look instead of one of disgust or suspicion? That costs nothing. I’m still a human. We’re all still human.

I’m trying. I won’t be in this situation forever. And I pray that if anyone who’s ever treated someone like me with cruelty ever finds themselves in my shoes… I pray people treat them more kindly than they treated me.

I just needed to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading.",2208

Just like when he suddenly remembered he was the father of two.,"After dating for almost 2 years and never seeing or hearing of any children. He suddenly brought home two precious little girls.

I should’ve kicked him out right there and then but I just couldn’t justify the girls suffering. 

I took care of them,comforted them when they were worried about losing their mother while he barely was around.

Tonight he had the audacity to be angry with me, because he feels I haven’t been paying him attention lately. 

But no worries. The girls are going back home(their mother has recovered enough for her to have them back) on Monday and then that fucker and I are done!

Edit— The funniest part is how everyone in his life just let him forget he was a father and never once did anyone tell me or even hint at him being a dad. Even his goddamn parents!",22108

I told my mom that I didn't want a graduation party or anything celebratory. I went to the ceremony, walked, got my diploma, went to my seat and walked to the my car, went home and took a nap.

I woke up a couple of hours later and had a picture taken with my mom who was a little sad but happy at the same time to see me. The day was low key and we never talked about it afterwards.

My daughter graduated this past Saturday and while I hugged her on the field, I started to get misty eyed from the moment, and then the realization of what I took from my mom dawned on me and I started to cry for real. I finally understood what I took from her and how she was hurting too at that time.

I feel like total shit over it and its been bothering me ever since. I imagine her looking for me on the field and realizing I wasn't there and how sad and upset she must have been. She deserved better from me.

With her being gone, I can never truly apologize and tell her I now grasp how deeply I hurt her on a day she was looking forward to.

As an American I believe that those who brags about the USA being the greatest country in the world are the ones who have never really seen the rest of the world. Don’t get me wrong, I love this country. But I’m tired of patriotic Americans shouting constantly that we are the greatest nation on earth. We are not. I travel extensively for work and I think anyone else who has also seen the world will probably agree - we are quite far from being the greatest. This may be hard for some to swallow, but it’s about time we realized this and started working on making America great again. Even though Trump shouts that line a lot, he’s made America worse and we are now a global joke. Let’s admit that our country needs work instead of being arrogant and proud. Don’t be blinded by patriotism.

I'm going to be different from now on.,"My husband didn't excite me when we were together. There were never big ups or downs. He wasn't mysterious, he didn't seem indifferent and he didn't play games. Other boyfriends were investors who racked up credit card charges on credit cards for impromptu getaways to the islands or Europe. My husband is an advanced practice nurse, saved his money and planned. I was so bored, but I hated being alone. So I married him. My mom told me it was a mistake. My father told me it was the best decision. My friends figured we'd get divorced after 12 months. He had student debt from his doctoral program. We weren't living the high life. I was 28 and wanted to be young and free. He was talking about health insurance. I liked him, but I didn't think I loved him. 

I got annoyed with him all the time. I was quick to snap at him. He would go out of his way to be kind and while I was appreciative, I didn't realize how kind he was. I took for granted that I was 'owed' that experience and he was just fulfilling his obligations. I really

Then COVID hit. 

I was obsessively worried about him. I couldn't calm down and I couldn't figure out why I was so amped. He works in surgery and the ICU and has really technical skills, so he was being deployed to help with the influx.   When I couldn't reach him one day I got so stressed out that I threw up and passed out. For much of 2020 I missed my period, I couldn't sleep and eventually my hair was falling out. The only time I was ""okay"" was when I could physically see him. I realized then how shitty I had been. I got into therapy. 

I realized that every guy who had been flashy, a big spender and cool and mysterious were scam artists/a man child looking for attention or a leech. They were throwing around money they didn't have. None of those couples are still together. 

The couples that threw around money and spent without care are destitute and no longer together. 

The couples with the big ups and big downs are broken up. None of them could make it work. 

The only couple going strong is the one I was certain was destined to fail. 

The big ups and downs take an emotional toll on you. They weaken the bonds of your relationship. Volatility is bad. My mom is like that. Extreme swings, constant need for excitement in a relationship or its ""boring."" Stability is bad, so she's always looking for instability. It's something I thought was normal. 

I like ""boring."" I like that we save for vacations and I am [REDACTED_NAME] his health insurance. I like that he is sweet and emotionally available. The ""boring"" guy does laundry, cooks, cleans and is a full-fledged adult with interests and goals and ambitions and passion. We have a marriage where we are together. We support each other and I have never felt as free to be vulnerable ever. 

I was horrid. I was cold. I looked down on him. I can't believe how unhappy I was. Hopefully he never finds out about the things I said. It would be cosmic justice if he left me. Now I worry about that. I just hope he doesn.t",18883

1ewpz0w,1724140931.0,2024-08-20 08:02:11,TrueOffMyChest,I will never get closure from my groomer,"I'm [REDACTED_NAME] mobile so sorry about the formatting. Also, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a throwaway because some of my family and friends use reddit. (I added the SA flair because this contains talks of grooming and I wasn't sure if that was something that fit under that category.)

This is something I've been thinking about for a while and it's not really something I can talk to people in my real life about without freaking them out lol

I [18NB] was groomed when I was a child. ""William"" [60M] (not his real name) had been basically a part of my family for years even before I was born, so no one ever suspected a thing. William would ask me for ""pictures"" (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you can guess what kind) in return for various things. Books, digital game currency, electronics, money, you name it. And since he babysat for me and my brother [16M] (who I later came to realize was also being preyed on) every Friday and Saturday, he had plenty of time to request these ""pictures."" Occasionally he would even ask me to give him oral, though that didn't happen nearly as often as the requests for ""pictures"" did. Since this was happening from when I was around 5 to when I was about 11 (and because my state has terrible sex ed) I never really realized what he was doing until years later. He only ever stopped because I started becoming uncomfortable with the sheer volume of pictures he was asking me to take and refused to take anymore.

When I was about 13, I watched a YouTube video of a girl reading out a letter about her sexual assault to her dad. After watching it I thought ""wow, I sure am glad nothing like this has ever happened to me!"" until I sort of had a ""wait a second"" moment and started thinking. For the longest time my brain had sort of blocked it out, and when I started thinking a little harder that ""hey, maybe something like that did happen to me,"" I had the realization. All of the memories slowly started to come back to me and I felt dirty. I remember showering twice a day for the next week or so to try and get the dirty feeling off of my skin, to no avail. 

For the next few months I would stay in my room with my door closed on Fridays and Saturdays to avoid speaking to or seeing William. Unfortunately, since he was still my brother and I's ""babysitter/family"" I had to go out with him and my mom some days, which was unavoidable. 

One day, during summer break, my (at the time) best friend and I were talking in the pool, and I ended up telling her about everything that happened involving William. She broke down and cried on my behalf, and I made her promise not to tell my parents until I was ready. She agreed, and for another 6 ish months it was brushed under the rug. Eventually, the guilt of the whole situation ate her up inside to them point where she broke down and told her father ""[OP] has something they need to tell their mom, it's important"" through tears. Her dad told my mom and when I was heading home with my mom from school that day she asked ""has anything been going on recently?"" and explained everything about what my friend's dad had told her. I, still very nervous, asked if we could talk about it when we got home, to which she said yes. And we did.

The aftermath was exactly what you would expect. My mom cried and held me, though I felt numb to the whole thing at this point. Then she told me to go get my brother so they could talk. I did, and about 10-15 minutes later my brother comes to get me from my room, saying something along the lines of ""hey, mom's crying again."" I asked my mom what was wrong (stupid question, I know) and she said ""He's been doing it to your brother too"" and continued crying. This is what still makes me the most upset to this day, the fact that William was still doing this shit to my (at the time) 13 year old brother. 

My dad came home shortly after, and once he heard the news from my mom we all packed into our car and went to the police station. My parents worked with the police to file a report on William, taking a long, detailed letter I had written about the whole thing for evidence. The next few months were kind of a blur, with my brother and I having to recreate the entire situation with various legal officials to get a better case against William. My mom was using various excuses of illness and just general busy-ness during this time to keep him away from the house.

One day, the private investigator we had been assigned drops by our house. While I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in, he tells my parents possibly the best and worst I could have heard at the time. ""William killed himself."" My parents had another very relieved cry at that moment, and everything seemed to be fine.

It's been about 3 years and 7 months since that happened, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] now realizing that I haven't gotten over it quite as well as I thought. The fact that I will never get any proper closure angers me on a daily basis. I still have nightmares about the man and I know I will never be able to get rid of him or the fear I have of him. He took the coward's way out and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to pay the price for it.

If you've read this far, thank you for reading my story. I don't think I'll ever really get any true kind of closure but I appreciate the ability to get this off my chest to a bunch of strangers.",8
18x454n,1704238805.0,2024-01-02 23:40:05,TrueOffMyChest,I was raped and it ruined my life,"Two things I want to mention at the start: Firstly, this should probably have sexual assault, suicide, and violence content warnings, but I can only select one, so this will have to do. Secondly, the reason I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this post is that I want it to exist somewhere outside my head, as a historical record or something. I don't expect any help or advice and probably won't read the comments because I don't feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] capable of dealing with that.

I was raped in 2022. I went from being happy, confident, and successful, with a great career, good health and okay social life, to being mentally ill, unemployed, suicidal, and living with my mom. My new year's resolution last year was to not kill myself. I told myself that things would get better. Nothing is better. I did essentially nothing this year, and I have no reason to think next year or any year will be better. I didn't make a new year's resolution this year. I can barely bring myself to apply for jobs, and I do horribly on job interviews. It feels like people can see that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and will be unreliable. It will only get worse as my unexplainable career gap grows.

To start from the beginning, in the spring of 2022, I went to a weekly board game event that was advertised on Reddit. The first time was fun and nothing bad happened. The second time was initially even better. One of the other participants was an American tourist. We got along very well and talked for most of the night. When the event had ended, we walked around the city and continued talking. Most of what we talked about was completely non-sexual. We talked about things like quantum mechanics, space, and computers, and about our jobs and her traveling. In hindsight, I realize that she was also flirting with me and that I was responding positively and basically flirting back, but I didn't realize that at the time.

We ended up outside her hotel and she asked if I wanted to come up to her room. I agreed. I genuinely was not thinking about sex at the time. I just wanted to continue talking, and I didn't realize that she wanted something else. When we got to her hotel room, we sat down on her bed and continued talking. We gradually got closer to each other and started cuddling. She initiated it, but I reciprocated voluntarily. I don't remember thinking anything of it. I don't understand why I felt so comfortable with her, a stranger. It feels untrue when I write it now, but it's how I remember it. She showed me some YouTube videos, and we spent a significant amount of time in bed without anything sexual happening.

At some point, she started touching me under my shirt and trying to remove it. I finally realized that she had sexual intentions, and I remember feeling repulsed by that. I don't know why. She was attractive, and we were getting along really well. I should have wanted to have sex with her, but I didn't want that at all. I have thought a lot about why I felt that way, and my theory is that it's because I thought the cuddling was platonic and then suddenly had to reevaluate the experience retroactively. I understand that it makes no sense that two strangers would go to a hotel room and cuddle platonically. I know that isn't a thing people do, and I knew that before as well, but just at that time, I thought that was what we were doing. I don't understand why.

I said “wait” and flinched away from her. She said something like “come on” and got on top of me. She started removing my pants and underwear. I said “stop” and “no” and similar words, but I think I said them quietly, definitely loud enough that she could hear me, but I never screamed. I tried with all my strength to try to push her off me, but I didn't try to hit her or fight back in any other way. I resisted, but in a panicked and uncoordinated way. She didn't seem to take my resistance seriously, and I think she was smiling and laughing. I think my perception of her demeanor has chanced as I relived what happened in my mind, so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure how accurate my memory is, but I think she may not have understood that I didn't want to.

I won't describe it, but she gave me a hand-job, forced me to penetrate her (I came inside her and I really don't want to think about what that could mean), and forced me to lick her vagina. I didn't resist at all for most of it. I just gave in and did what she wanted. I don't have a clear picture of how long it took. I think it could have been anything from 10 minutes to an hour or more. The more I think about it, the less certain I become of the details. When she was done, she kissed me and left to take a shower. I got my things and ran out of there as quickly as I could. I walked home and tried to sleep.

The next day was a Friday, and I was supposed to work, but I couldn't bring myself to interact with anyone. I ghosted work and stayed in bed, binge-watching a comforting TV series. I felt sad and empty, but I actually think I felt less bad compared to now. I didn't contact work until the following Monday, when I emailed my boss saying I was sick. My boss wished me a speedy recovery and didn't ask any questions.

A week later, HR emailed and said that I needed to contact a doctor and get a sick note. I called a doctor and said that I was anxious and depressed. I described my symptoms honestly, but did not tell him about the reason. I lied and said that it was probably because of work related stress. I got a sick note and stayed home for several weeks. I did not feel better and barely left my home during this time. I lived off delivery food, didn't shower, didn't answer phone calls, and barely answered texts. I eventually had another phone call with the doctor. He wanted me to try antidepressants. I refused, but I agreed to talk to a therapist. The doctor extended my sick note and put me on the waitlist for talk therapy.

When I had the first appointment with the therapist, I told her the same lie about work related stress. I talked about some of my symptoms and feelings, but not the full extent of them or anything about the true cause. I had several weekly appointments after that, and I started to trust her more. Eventually, I decided to tell the truth. I told the therapist that I had been lying about what caused my problems and explained that I was raped. She listened to me for a few minutes before interrupting me and asking if I was describing a sexual fantasy. When I insisted that I was telling the truth, she started interrogating me about details that were allegedly unbelievable or contradictory. I eventually started crying and disconnected from the call. I cried hysterically in a way I have never done before or after in my adult life. I didn't cry like this when I was being raped, but I did now. I don't know why. Nothing the therapist said was comparable to the rape, but that's how I reacted. She tried to call me, but I did not answer. She left a voicemail where she said that she believed that I believed I had been raped, but that it was a delusion triggered by my stress and that my story didn't make any sense. She sounded emotional and like she was holding back anger.

I went to my balcony and tried to jump, but something in me stopped me and I went back inside. I started researching suicide methods and felt completely hopeless and empty. I also felt angry. My emotions were stronger than I ever remember them being. I don't understand why it affected me so much. I had expected not to be believed. That's why I waited so long to tell anyone. And it was just words, and words don't hurt or cause damage. It was nothing compared to the rape, but I reacted stronger to it. Maybe it was just because this was the expected outcome, so my subconscious mind had an opportunity to prepare, while I never expected to be raped, so my reaction was more paralyzing than anything else. I don't know.

I didn't want to go back to the doctor, so I went back to work after the sick note expired. It made me feel better in some ways, but I couldn't focus and did not preform anywhere near the level I did before. Unfinished work started to pile up, I made excuses and pushed deadlines. I had a panic attack in a meeting and had to leave. Eventually, I was put on a performance improvement plan and resigned shortly after.

My mental health started deteriorating again. I applied for a few jobs, but I sometimes couldn't even bring myself to follow up when they responded. I was invited to some interviews, but I never got an offer. I stopped showering, stopped going outside, stopped answering messages and calls. My mom called the police after I didn't answer her texts and calls for a while. The police officers stood outside my apartment door and knocked for what felt like forever before I opened and confirmed I was alive. I got even worse and stopped cleaning or taking out the trash. Deliveroo bags and other trash soon covered more or less every surface, and mixed with it was the occasional half-eaten meal, attracting vermin. I didn't do anything about it and lived like that for months before I moved back to my mom. I had to pay the landlord a lot of money to compensate them for the damage I caused. Returning to a cleaner environment helped a little, and I started applying for jobs again, but I have had no success.
I feel completely broken and useless. I don't feel like I will ever be myself again. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] broken to live and too weak to die, so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] stuck like this. My mom takes care of me like she did when I was a child, and that's kind of how I feel. Like a mentally disabled perpetual child. There is no reason I should be like this. Other people go through even worse things and manage to remain functional adults. It would have been understandable if I needed a few weeks to heal and recover, but it has been way too long and there is no reason to think this is the end. There is no reason to think there is an end other than the end of my life, probably dying of old age in an institution.",44
t04i9y,1645685866.0,2022-02-24 06:57:46,TrueOffMyChest,I am Russan and you don't realize how fucked the situation is,"Putin has gone completely mad and we, Russians, have no means of stopping him. Why don't we protest against the war? Any and all opposition is physically eradicated: killed, jailed or threatened into silence. Protesting is illegal, any mass gathering will be immediately destroyed with mass beatings, water cannons and torture in police stations afterwards. Even if you manage to voice your opinion on the streets in a completely legal way, you will be arrested anyway because fuck you. You can be beaten, brought to court and jailed for a *like under a random social media post* if a police officer sees it when he needs to improve his statistics.

I don't even get what he wants to achieve. Petty revenge for disobedience? Mindless landgrab? Sincere delusion about Ukraine being evil? I don't know and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure I even want to know. All I see is that they aren't even trying to look realistic. All ""direct broadcasts"" of their gatherings are badly pre-recorded, all decisions are taken in advance. Their speeches make me feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a really bad satiric novel. It looks like even Putin's closest comrades are afraid of him and don't know what he's doing or thinking.

I feel like it's the beginning of the end but don't know which end it would be. Even feelings aside, we don't have the economy for full-scale war or isolation, even USSR in 1930s was in a better place, and nobody is going to do anything about it. If Putin takes over Ukraine, it's over, all of Eastern Urope will completely turn into Mordor for the nearest 20 years, with orcs running around the wasteland and killing everyone they don't like or just whoever happened to be near. Probably he wouldn't even stop at Ukraine. If Putin falls from the throne, be it from NATO intervention or intrigues of his court (not all of them will like such complete disregard for their well-being and loss of property abroad), it will be a chance at a better future for Russia when spiders finish eating each other.

Well, the further it gets, the more often I hear the saying ""A horrific end is better than unending horror"". Ukrainians, brothers and sisters, maybe you have the strength to resist where we failed and tip this rotten abomination over the edge. Maybe we will find the last bit of resolve to oppose this. Maybe one day we all will prosper in peace and friendship.",13053

1fa0eqs,1725577908.0,2024-09-05 23:11:48,TrueOffMyChest,I struggled with erotomania for years and got over it without knowing what it was,"I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to posting on reddit but I've been reading for a while, hopefully I don't mess this up. This is likely to be quite long so I hope it's not too wordy.

Erotomania is a delusional disorder in which you strongly believe someone, usually with some kind of status in society or in a position of power, is in love with you. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] learning more about it as I will explain below, but associated delusions often include that the person, regardless of actual relationship status, has a secret relationship with you and communication between the two individuals occurs through secret signals such as clothing color, hidden messages in social media, or coincidental events. This is something I experienced for a period of about three to four years and I just wanted to get this off my chest so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] here. I don't think there's many first person accounts of what this is like so maybe it will be interesting to read from the perspective of someone who was in the midst of it.

To start, I have PTSD and I think this was the intial foundation on which this had potential to grow. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] exactly sure someone can be stricken with this out of the blue without any previous history of poor mental wellness, as exciting as that might be to ponder. However, the events that led to my PTSD occurred around 2013 and the erotomania set in about 6 months later in the same year. At the time I was not diagnosed with PTSD, so for all intents and purposes I didn't realize anything was really ""wrong,"" which led to me missing the signs that I was heading down a dark path. I want to try to remain anonymous with some details of the story because I've never shared this blow by blow with anyone and I have a lot of deep shame about it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] ready at this moment to confront widespread recognition among the people I hurt throughout this ordeal so I don't want to be recognized by my story just yet.

So, to begin, I was living in another country that was not my home country studying abroad. The person who was the subject of my erotomania was a celebrity in that country who isn't exactly world famous but probably known by name by most people there or in neighboring countries. I'll call this person Jim. Unlike many people who develop erotomania, I happened to actually meet Jim. I was a fan of another celebrity in that country, let's call him Todd, and my hobby was to go to events and whatnot for that celebrity. There is a neighborhood in the city where lots of celebrities hang out as their entertainment agencies are there, and I often hung out there doing things for Todd, who I've also met several times through official events. I met Jim right at the beginning of his career in a coffeeshop in that neighborhood. I bought a coffee one day before going to an event and Jim was at the pickup counter waiting for his. A couple of fans approached him and asked, ""Are you Jim?"" which caught my attention. Jim greeted them and then gave me a glance and smile to see if I would approach too. I smiled and said I didn't really know of him but I asked him if he was with Agency X and he said yes. I congratulated him on his debut in the industry and he asked me where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and such. We had a pleasant small talk conversation and went on our ways. After that, Jim always seemed to be around and I ran into him several more times. Jim remembered me I guess and would smile at me or wave when we ran across one another and one time we rode the bus together and he sat next to me when he saw I was on the bus. He said something like 'oh, you!' and he asked where I was going. Nothing ever progressed from innocent small talk. Within the course of three months or so though he started to get really busy with his career, and he had an assistant now to get his coffees, so the run-ins tapered off. The last time I ever saw Jim was February 2014 when I saw his back as he was walking up the street. I never saw him again. I did think Jim was really cute, and I definitely liked him but during the time of us meeting it was normal and healthy. My friends knew about me meeting Jim and sometimes were around when we ran across each other, so they knew that he had at least met me in passing which I think was a key factor in why this situation managed to spiral out of control without detection.

When I first met Jim, I followed his public and official instagram account and liked and commented on some of his posts. My pictures were on my account so, in theory, if he checked my account he would know it was me. The first inklings that this was starting to be unhealthy was that I was very certain that Jim knew my instagram account and I believed that his lack of reciprocation on the interactions was due to the fact that he wanted to keep his official life separate from his private life, and I took that to mean I must be part of his private life. But during the time I was meeting Jim, everything was still relatively fine. If I look back on it, there was oddly a gap in time from the last time I saw Jim to the start of the delusions. I estimate that the delusions started to set in around May of 2014. Since I no longer was meeting Jim, I began to monitor his instagram for any secret signals that he was acknowledging me and I told my friends that I thought Jim liked me. The situation escalated very quickly from there. I thought Jim's instagram content was a way of reaching out to me. I could see hints of me in practically anything he posted. Jim wrote a song and the premise was basically something like, 'just tell me you like me, don't leave me hanging' which of course was plain as day to be about me. I told my best friend about all of this and she was skeptical since we only had a few passing interactions. This was intially only disappointing but became something that frustrated me to my core. The best way I can explain this feeling is as if you are trying to talk about something which is super common knowledge within a subject you are passionate about, but the listener just isn't accepting it and is just saying that your explanation is perfectly logical and makes sense but they're just not sure because of subjective reasons. I felt like my best friend was being subjective and I was the logical one, and it was infuriating. This is what led to me lying intially. When I lied about me and Jim, first to my best friend and eventually to everyone, it was perfectly justified in my mind. I felt like I was exaggerating the stories out of necessity because what they needed to understand was the connection to me and Jim, not the details of how it was established. So in this example, my friend wouldn't believe Jim's song was about me because Jim and I were no longer in contact. So I lied and told her that I actually exchanged numbers with Jim and we were in fact still in contact and he gave me a heads up to listen to the song. This led to her finally accepting my story as plausible which was what I needed to get from her and wasn't getting from the real story. I guess in my mind it felt like a white lie. When someone asks you how they look in a dress that's not looking good on them, you would maybe say a detail about the dress you don't like instead of saying it doesn't suit them because the point is to guide them to another clothing item, right? I thought that what I was doing was equivalent to that. Whether Jim told me directly or told me through song lyrics that he liked me, the point is that he liked me right?

I became friends with someone who liked another celebrity at Jim's agency. I knew that my relationship with Jim was top secret by this point so I was very elusive about Agency X all the time to the point where it was obvious that I was keeping something in. This person eventually just asked me about it and I confessed that I was in a secret relationship with Jim. I showed her all his social media and pointed out all the things that were about me, verified how we met and told her I had to keep this a secret. She was overwhelmed and immediately accepted the story as true and kept my secret, but I didn't. Eventually the Jim thing got out to all my friends and, shockingly, everyone accepted the story as plausible. I was never confronted about lying or exaggerating because all the lies I developed to glue the story together were already established. Jim was asked about relationships in an interview and he said he was really focused on his career and wouldn't settle down for a few years. I interpreted this as Jim telling me I needed to wait for a while before we could come out with our relationship and start dating publicly, so no one ever asked why I was never seen on a date or spending time with Jim. I used a messaging app very common in the country and put a lot of security passcodes on it so that people couldn't easily see my chat history. This was because I didn't want anyone to find out I actually had no chat history with Jim but of course I told everyone it was to protect my chat history with Jim from getting out. I was completely sure of my relationship with Jim being real as much I am [REDACTED_NAME] 1 plus 1 is 2 so I had zero doubts about the fact that I was actually not in contact with Jim and I just felt like people wouldn't understand the proof I had. At almost no point during my delusions did I have a problem with the lying.

During this time, every single day of my life was about Jim. We did coincidentally have some shared interests, so I doubled down hard on those. But Jim also had his own interests, and when he would reveal those I would suddenly realize that I also have actually been interested in those things this entire time and just didn't notice it. I completely changed my personality and interests to match Jim. Another thing was that Jim dressed and maintained his appearance like a celebrity, which is fine. But I also realized that as the secret girlfriend of a celebrity I should start doing the same. I changed my wardrobe to luxury clothing and spent all of my money on treatments and makeup to maintain my appearance. Now, I told you about how I was a fan of Todd earlier. I started to develop the idea that Jim didn't like that, as I was above fan level being a secret girlfriend and all and he didn't want me seen in 'the crowd' following someone else. I started to attend events for Todd secretively, sitting in the back with sunglasses on instead of the front. Before Jim I had a decent fan-celebrity relationship with Todd but it took a nosedive once I went off the rails about Jim. I told all my friends I had to keep my activities with Todd a secret from Jim. If there was an event like a festival, etc where Jim and Todd were both there (it happened a few times) I needed to leave or be hidden before Jim came on stage. I began to 'see' in Jim's social media that when I went to stuff for Todd, he would make sad or angry posts in the following days to show his disapproval. There was something that coincidentally actually happened that unfortunately sent me spiraling further. Todd was making regular appearances on a weekly show and fans could attend in the audience. I went every week but there was one week when I was tired from wasting myself on delusions and decided to skip it. My friends decided to go. That exact time I skipped, Jim ended up being a special surprise guest. Of course my phone blew up and my friends were absolutely astonished. I knew that Jim went there trying to catch me supporting Todd and the narrow miss completely solidified the plausibility of my story to both me and among all my friends.

Shortly after that, I was in pure emotional trenches trying to choose between Jim and Todd. I actually felt Jim was trying to manipulate me into giving up something important to me to continue the secret relationship with him. I felt frustrated that Jim expected me to spend years of my life waiting in the wings for him while he was free to do his thing, and this led to me venting to all my friends and eventually making the decision to unfollow Jim on instagram and start distancing myself, of course to send a big message as to what I thought about all of this manipulation. Here occurred the second major unfortunate coincidence. A few days after I unfollowed Jim, he made an instagram post with a sad face and then deleted his entire instagram a few days after that. A week or two later he made a public appearance and was disheveled and photographed sitting on the ground in public looking a mess. It led to him making a statement that he was starting treatment for depression. I knew this was all because I unfollowed him and he was devastated to lose me. I saw this as confirmation that he really did love me and he was so sorry to treat me badly. I decided at that point to choose Jim over Todd, and I left the Todd fandom. My best friend finished her study abroad and went back to her home country which was a 10 hour flight away. We were roommates so I got a tiny studio and I started living alone. The isolation and the consecration of my devotion to Jim was a recipe for disaster and even more than before I became completely obsessed with Jim. During this time, a friend of mine got into tarot cards and introduced me to them. Bad idea. Suddenly I could know what Jim was thinking and feeling about me all the time and I didn't have to wait for a social media post or a song! Of course as a self-taught reader I could see Jim's love for me blatantly in every reading. Jim really wanted me to wait. Jim would make this period of waiting all worth it. Jim definitely wanted to marry me and start a family and I needed to start making plans to stay in the country since my study abroad was ending soon and I had originally planned to finish up my degree at home. I ended up dropping out of my home university over Jim. I enrolled in a college in the country that didn't take any of my home country's credits and started over as a freshman, but my mental health was so poor I couldn't keep up with school. Nonetheless, I managed to hang by a string for about two years on enrollment before I was academically expelled. As I was changing schools, I suddenly developed a notion that I really needed to see Jim in person again to discuss what was going on and get some confirmation that this was what he wanted me to do. Instead of going to class, I wandered aimlessly around areas where I met Jim in the past trying to run across one another again. I religiously checked for celebrity sightings for Jim, and if he was seen anywhere I would camp there for weeks trying to come across him. We never met no matter my efforts. I was engrossed in tarot card readings about Jim and I thought I could become a tarot card reader since I destroyed my career path of choice by dropping out of one school and failing another. When I was kicked out of the second school, I stayed in the country on 90-day visitor status and left and re-entered the country whenever the 90 days were up. As a visitor to the country now I couldn't get a job, and I don't think I could have handled a job in my condition anyway. Another heartbreaking lie is that my parents, who were paying for my education, thought that I simply extended my study abroad and that my home uni miraculously gave me permission to finish out my education here. I used the tuition money they sent me to live off of, but they started getting suspicious when my graduation date came and went and I needed to tell stories as to why I was still in school.

While I was flunking out of college, I should say what Jim was up to I guess. Jim found contentment for himself after his depression through humanitarian causes and his social media and artistic output started to gravitate toward that. I couldn't 'see' as many messages for me in his content as before and I was actually a little distracted by the mess I made of my own life but I just barrelled onward knowing that the plan was still on for Jim and I to reunite and I could always know what he was thinking about me with the tarot cards.

This all came to a head due to several things all happening at once. My best friend finished uni and got a job in the country where I still was squatting in 2017. A few months after that, I broke my leg and became quarantined in my fourth floor walkup apartment. Then, my parents confronted me while my leg was broken about my endless schooling and told me they were going to cut me off without a clear plan for graduation which I couldn't provide. I took this as a sign to jump start my professional career as a tarot reader and I decided to try a professional reading for myself to figure out what experience I should provide to future clients. I was still desperately trying to run back into Jim, so I bought a tarot reading through Fiverr (lol) with some of my tuition money of course, as this was part of my career plan and therefore a sound investment. I explained to the reader that I was in a on-off relationship with Jim and trying to reconnect and asked him when and where we might meet again. A few days later, the reader delivered. Part of my recovery is to ignore all forms of divination, so I really hesitate to chalk this up to anything more than the universe simply delivering the right message at the right time, but the results from the reader completely rocked my world. The reader told me that any potential relationship I had with Jim had long been dead. He told me that Jim likely didn't really have feelings for me anymore if he ever did at all. He actually told me that the major barrier to me meeting Jim again was his career and only if I were perhaps joining the same industry as him would we have a slim chance of meeting, which fits perfectly seeing as he is a celebrity, but any sort of relationship ignition from there was doubtful.

When I listened to the audio file, my blood ran ice cold. I remember the exact moment I excitedly opened the audio file in Quicktime and made myself comfortable with my broken leg propped up. As the audio played, it started to feel like all the blood had left my body, but it was just moving on its own agency. After I listened to it, I put my computer away and hobbled up to make my usual morning coffee, but it was just like my body was moving on its own. I was in shock. I have had loved ones unexpectedly pass, lots of terrible surprises in my life, but I have never felt such a profound shock as I did listening to a stupid Fiverr tarot card reading. I think the reason for this is it was just...reality. It was the exact reality of the situation spelled out for me word for word. And somewhere deep within me, in a part of me I had covered up with years and years of lies, there was that part of my self that remembered how everything began and knew that this all was true. It was a part of me I thought was ugly and never wanted to face, but sometimes did when I dropped out of one school, failed another, gave up friends and loved ones who I adored, got evicted a few times, and especially when I broke my leg and I would just lay in my tiny studio staring at the ceiling, making itself known in the quiet moments when I had already exhausted every thought I had about Jim and had nothing left to think. I wish I could say this was my come to Jesus moment and I started to pick up the pieces of my life and all, but the split within me was far too severe. This time period is a bit blurry for me, but I remember that in the first few days I just ignored it. As my leg began to heal, I began to plan for when I would hit the trail again looking for Jim. Then, I suddenly crashed and exploded one day. I just stopped eating. I damaged my eyes from crying. I would have these semi-hallucinations I don't know how to explain. I remember one that kept coming up: I would suddenly strongly envision myself on this cliff overlooking the ocean, and around me was wild lavender growing. Another one that came up is being surrounded by blueberries all around me, even floating in the air. I don't really know why this happened or what it had to do with Jim but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] detailing my experience. I also fell off the face of the planet to everyone except my best friend who had no idea what was going on but would check up on me by force. I think she thought I was depressed about my broken leg and having to be isolated for so long. I just don't remember much from March to May of 2017.

When I left the house again around the summer of 2017, I actually went back to my routine of trying to meet Jim, because I didn't know any other means of existing by that point. But I was different. Instead of camping in places where Jim had been spotted, I just started walking. I also had delusions on the side that if I walked a lot and got in good shape that my leg would be stronger and not break again so I needed to walk profuesly for medical reasons. I also kept up with not eating. I lost about 45 pounds in two months. I would say I probably walked on average about 12 hours a day. I definitely was a shell of my former self, which in spite of being delusional was always positive and vibrant. My landlord who was a nice and reasonable lady visited me to congratulate me on healing, but she wanted to let me know that, while she didn't spring this on me as I was recovering from the injury in order to not make it harder on me, I should probably start looking for a new place to live when I was ready to as I hadn't paid rent in about six months and whenever I did pay it was well under the agreed amount. I should have mentioned this earlier, but all my money, tuition my parents sent me to pay for uni was still being spent on luxury clothes and makeup to maintain my appearance for Jim and I could never make rent so I was routinely evicted throughout the years. So I moved once again. My best friend volunteered to help. While we were moving me out, my best friend confronted me about my erratic behavior. Sometime during the time she was digging for what was going on, she asked me how it was going with Jim as a warmup question to getting to the heart of what was bothering me. I just looked at her with a deadpan expression and I told her that Jim and I ended things. It was like I was realizing that myself simultaneously. She was completely shocked by this and asked me how I felt, and I was truthful about how I was actually feeling because I did go through all of the grief of a traumatic breakup and then losing this part of myself that had become my core identity. Unfortunately because I wasn't recovered, I had processed my relationship with Jim over the prior year or so and I was able to 'see' a point in which Jim had expressed to me that he no longer wanted a relationship with me. Now years after Todd, my friends started going to a couple of events for a new celebrity we'll call Ryan. They invited me to a Ryan concert in summer of 2016 and I went. Ryan also hosted a meet and greet and I decided to buy a ticket for that in December of 2016. After the meet and greet, I learned that Ryan went to a famous performing arts high school and some of his classmates and friends were friends with Jim. I cut off the Ryan thing right then and there but I could rationally realize that around January of 2017 word got back to Jim that I was back 'in the crowd' again and Jim just gave up on me because I couldn't stick to my guns about properly keeping myself away from the public, which was ultimately a dealbreaker for him. Yes, all this came out of thin air, but at this point everything in my life was made up out of thin air and I still hadn't come to terms with me being delusional. Oh, I definitely told my friend that Jim and I ended things through conversation and not a tarot card reading which was in line with me feeling justified to lie as long as the essential point was understood.

Most things about Jim after this point sort of tapered off so it's not worth detailing in this already extremely long tale. I'll skip from here to the aftermath. I think the point at which I could say I moved on from Jim was around spring of 2018. I never actually realized the delusional aspect of all of this as I did not know what erotomania was. The theory that I was most comfortable with to explain why I did all this is that I might be a pathological liar or have some serious loneliness but I never saw a professional over it. I felt a lot of shame over this and became really avoidant about talking about Jim and I started to refrain from repeating lies I told to solidify my stories. Like I would bring up that Jim and I were over but not talk about the conversation we supposedly had about it. My life moved forward. It took me a long, LONG time to pick up all the pieces of everything I broke. I finally saw a therapist in 2021 for the first time and I was diagnosed with PTSD. Having PTSD makes every repair effort I made to my life three times as hard. I am [REDACTED_NAME] school now in my thirties and working towards a degree I sabotaged 10 years ago over a fake relationship. I never came clean to all the people I lied to but my friendships mostly fell off over the years. Part of the reason was because I finally left that country, a huge catalyst in my recovery, and we started to have less in common, but the delusional lies interwoven through now years of friendship left little of reality for the relationships to stand on. I am [REDACTED_NAME] friends with my best friend even though I haven't exactly come clean. I have told her that I think I misinterpreted a lot of signals from Jim to be serious interest rather than casual. We really don't talk much or at all about Jim now. One goalpost I use to measure my recovery is that, intially, whenever I would see a picture of Jim or hear his music in the wild it felt like a suckerpunch to my gut. It just hurt so bad that we were over. One day, again around spring of 2018, out of the blue I just realized that feeling was gone. I just didn't have any reaction to his existence anymore.

I did have two 'relapses' over Jim where I tried to reignite things in my mind with Jim. Both times came when I was being confronted with something else in life and I think I was just looking for an escape. When I was in my delusions about Jim, I was actually quite happy on a day to day basis. It was really exciting and a good feeling to have that a celebrity was in love with me and all of this exciting stuff was going on. Real life really sucked so much and sometimes I unfortunately still feel that way. I had a third relapse, but this time it wasn't over Jim. It started to show up over yet another celebrity I had met by chance last year. Fortunately, I started to recognize the signs it was all sparking up again and I immediately moved to block this person out of my life. I don't know what to say about this at this point except maybe due to my incredibly unique circumstances I should avoid meeting people with any amount of fame entirely, I guess. I really try to avoid any form of divination as well, although I have slipped and dabbled again several times. I just remind myself that I am [REDACTED_NAME] a fortune teller and remind myself about when I have tried to predict things and been wrong and then go on my merry way.

I went on completely in the dark about why I did all of this for years. I actually just learned about erotomania a few weeks ago when I stumbled upon a story on LetsNotMeet. The OP of that post mentioned what the person had (although that story was far more terrifying than mine), and I was curious if it was similar to what I had done all those years ago. I googled it. It was right on the money. It felt like the WebMD articles about it and such were just telling the story of my life to me as someone who was there all along. I was actually really sad when I discovered it, but then also somewhat relieved that I am [REDACTED_NAME] the only person who ever did this. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] careful to remove my own agency from this as I can't really accept that I did nothing wrong. I did so many wrong things and did so much on my own to affirm my delusion. I have a lot of mental health issues stemming from PTSD and I think this was just my mind's way of trying to seek happiness and thrive, as we all are. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a work in progress, but discovering what actually happened to me 10 years ago took a huge weight off my chest and even typing this out has helped me confront myself and I want to be a better person in the future.

I think I might have covered everything in this epic tale but if it makes it to the sub and anyone is interested, I'd be happy to answer any questions. If you feel like you might be going through the same thing, I am [REDACTED_NAME] no way qualified to give advice, but looking back on my own story I can say that there were several exits along the way but I never took them because I was stuck chasing false happiness. I wish I could say real happiness is always better but it's too corny. What I will say is that real happiness is always true. It's the truth and it can't be taken away like delusional happiness can. We are hardwired to chase happiness and feeling good, but when I was left with reality, which is always true and existing, the grief and profound sense of loss that was associated with that far, FAR outweighed any amount of happiness I ever felt being delusional.

Thanks to anyone who reads my story.",3

Well, about 5 years ago when I was pregnant my husband and I were 23 at the time. He cooked for me one night. Cooked my favorite meal but messed it up, and I called him stupid for it. He said “I was just trying to-“ and I said “stop trying, just stop you’ll just ruin it again” and I told him “you can’t do anything right” and he went upstairs into our room and I cooked something. I told him dinner is ready and he came down, ate and went back upstairs. I thought he was mad at me so I let him be.

That night I woke up to him setting up a noose in our living room. He was being a bit noisy and I went downstairs and saw him tying it and everything. He told me to go away but I figured out what was happening and called 911. They took him away for a few days. I tried to visit but he said he didn’t want to see me, so they said no.

I picked him up and he wouldn’t talk to me. I started yelling and crying and asking him “Why would you do this to me?!?! You want me to be sad and alone for the rest of my life?!?! You want me to be a single mother?!? You want me to die alone?!? You want to take away the only person left that loves me.?!?! HOW COULD YOU TRY TO LESVE ME TO FEND FOR MYSELF? YOURE SO STUPID!!!!” and I finally calmed down and said “why do you nit want to be alive?” And he said “I’m sick of being stupid” it was that moment I realized I was abusing him.

Ever since that moment I treated him like a king. I never said anything mean again. I give him all the hugs and kisses he’ll ever want. I tell him I love him 10x a day. Ever since then, I realized if I don’t treat him like the beautiful soul he is, I’m going to lose him. I know nothing will ever make up for how I once treated him, but I hope one day he knows, he is not stupid, I am.

Edit: for those asking, I’ve been in therapy for 5 years now. We did couples therapy for a couple years, but I still see my individual therapist. I don’t try to gaslight him or anything like that. Everything I said, all the hurtful words, were 100% my fault. He did absolutely nothing wrong. Just me. He’s not stupid. I am.",9381
1jcqtey,1742146400.0,2025-03-16 17:33:20,TrueOffMyChest,I stopped drinking and realized I don't like my girlfriend,"Basically the title. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a relatively new relationship, about 9 months. Although it hasn't been too long, we've already had the marriage and kids conversations and are pretty much on the same page as it relates to timelines and expectations.

  
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a heavy drinker (about 4 times a week). Because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] older I've decided to stop drinking and smoking to save money, prioritize my health and re-evaluate my relationship with alcohol. It's been just over a month.

Since I've stopped I've been much calmer, argue less and listen much more. It's been okay so far, but really everything she does just annoys me. If I was drinking some of the things she says when she tries to argue with me I would've argued back. Since I've been sober I just listen to her complain and try to  draw me into an argument. I wait until she shuts up, then try to change the topic to something else. We sit in silence a lot more now. 

  
The relationship has positives, so I have no intention of leaving. It's actually the main reason why I stopped drinking and smoking. I also know you're not supposed to make any major decisions when you've just made major lifestyle changes. I also know these changes could be a big contributor to me being irritated in general. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] just here to vent. 

  
Hoping it all works out in the end. ",3722
1fdnhmz,1725989051.0,2024-09-10 17:24:11,TrueOffMyChest,I don't know what to feel or do. ,"First, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if my English is not good, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a non-English speaking country, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the English that I know and a translator. 

This story is recently but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to start with something of my past. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] male, but I feel more confortable with feminine gender. When I was 6 yo one of my cousins thought me ""a game"" if you know what I mean. I just don't want to remember what happened exactly is something that I tried so hard to forget, I just remember he used to take me apart from family reunions to my room when it was in my house or to his room if the reunion were in his family house, the rest you can imagine. 

That happened for a while. I don't remember how much but my mother found me crying one time after my family left my house and I just couldn't hold it anymore. My parents broke contact with his parents but they didn't do anything legal as I know.

Now my story. When I was 19, I had a group of friends, I was one of the olders of the group and we were like the parents of the group.. We planned the reunions (most of them just play videogames and watch movies or have a meet to eat something and talk), we were in charge of the youngers member and if there was a problem talked with their parents, things like that. 

One of the members was a girl of 15 yo, she like me is trans girl (in that moment still referenced herself as ""Him"") we were close friends, helped each other, play games, talk a lot about anime and things. Things like that. 

After some time, she started to talk to me more intimately, being romantic with me, even in front of her parents, I was really shy with those kinds of things, never had a partner, never even questioned me if I liked men or women, and I was still on my last year of school before university (I had to repeat 2 years of scholarship).

After a time of this, I just. accepted her intentions. we started dating, it was really similar to American romance movies, go to cinema, play games, kisses, hugs... that kind of things, her parents were okay with us dating, our friends never said anything, and I was lost in the moment.

We never had sex.. she asked me for that, and I just got red, each time that she asked me for that I couldn't even talk, just say ""I don't know"" or things like that.. After a week of she insisting me I accept, but in the moment that we went to a private room, and my mind understood that we're going to have intimacy. I started to cry, all the memories of my cousin went back to me and the only thing that I could say was ""I don't want to do this"". 

She insisted... she even started to take off her clothes and I asked crying to stop and try to open the door, until I finally left that room. She didn't tell me anything, didn't ask me what happened or anything, just stayed there and after 2 days she broke with me telling me that if I wasn't able to give her what she wanted, we couldn't date.

I was okay with that. we were friends from 8 years more, I went to therapy to try to help me, and she even helped me with that, we both together discovered that neither of us was men, we had works together, and we started to stream together. 

Our relationship broke when she became popular, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to deny that I was jealous, but I was happy for her, she eventually stops telling me and I felt like I was left behind, tried to talk with her again but it wasn't the same.

A mutual friend helped me a lot to face that, for me lose a friend, even more if is close to me it feels worse than death. But I understood that she wanted to have a new life, and I wasn't part of that, I only would like to hear it from her voice and not from another friend.

After a year, of that, in the present, there were rumors of her in internet, I don't know what kind, I just decided to keep my life and don't think any more on her, I even asked to mutual friends in discord that don't tell me about her because it still was hard to me to face that our friendship was over.

But suddenly she posted a cancelation talking about me.. She was guilting me about the rumors of her, telling things of me like I wasn't a good person and that... and in the end of that, she mentioned when we dated, she mentioned that she was minor aged.

When our romance happened, I didn't realize that I didn't think in that, nobody told me that what I was doing was wrong, even her parents knew, and they were okay.. I started crying, I felt that I did to someone else what my cousin did to, I felt like that shit..

My little community didn't say anything until I posted my answer, I admitted that it was true, that we had a romantic relationship but I deny that we had sex, I never explained what happened in the room, but I accepted the guilty of dating her, not for the rumors.

I lost everything, my fiance left me, I lost my job, friends, community, I receive hate in my dm's, in my channel, even this post I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it with another account to try to protect me, but I still am afraid.

I feel like the worst thing in the world, people are asking her to make this legal, but she don't want it because in her words I don't deserve her time, but I even want to go to jail.. I know that I did something bad, and I don't have any excuse, and the worst part is that I know this doesn't care to her, friends near to she told me that, she just used it to take me out of her life finally.

I don't know what to do, I started therapy once again, my psychologist tell me that I didn't anything bad if her parents and she were okay that happened, that we didn't had relations and that.. But I can't stop thinking that I deserve to go to jail and rot there...   
  
I just want to stop feeling like this, I even thought in go to police by myself and make me arrest for this o even kill me but I don't have the strong to do it...  ",1
xz1v1r,1665258703.0,2022-10-08 19:51:43,TrueOffMyChest,I almost shot a woman because of how she treated me when I was having a bad day.,"This happened almost a year ago, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a throwaway to make sure no one ever finds out what went through my mind that day.

It was on the worst day of my life, that I almost made a decision that would have ruined everything. I was on my way home from work, when I got a call from my mother. She had found my father dead only an hour earlier. He had gone out into the backyard to tend their garden and had an aneurysm. He was out there for 15 minutes before my mother found him, and he was dead by the time the ambulance arrived. I was incredibly close to my dad. I talked to him almost every day, and due to circumstances, I had not seen him in person in almost 3 years. So to hear he was just gone, well, it took me to a place I cannot describe.

I immediately pulled off the road and went and bought a pack of cigarettes. I had been clean from tobacco for 6 years at that point and that was the only thing I could think of to calm myself down. I smoked half the pack off to the side of the shop trying not to break down into an absolute mess.

Out of nowhere, a woman approached me and started to harass me. Despite the shop selling cigarettes, it was a smoke-free building and I was still close enough to the entrance I guess. The woman insulted me and called me selfish and stupid. She made a scene, but no one really paid attention. In the state I was in, I couldn't even respond. I just stood there as she called me names and harassed me as I just stared at her.

What the woman didn't know, was I had a gun on me. I had a permit and concealed carried. As I stood there, something in me told me to shoot her. I felt so numb, and yet at the same time near the edge of a cliff about to stumble and fall. My mind was screaming at me to shoot her. If she didn't have a child with her, I hate to admit it but I may have made a mistake and ruined multiple lives that day.

I didn't even say a word to her. I just walked to my car and peeled out of the parking lot. I've never told anyone what happened that day. But now that my father's death has since passed, my emotions have calmed down. I hate to admit how close I was to murdering someone that day.

Update:

This thread has gotten some attention. So I'll add some more info.  


I don't conceal carry anymore. My gun is locked away in a safe in my closet and hasn't been out for 7-ish months. I've been in therapy for a while now to deal with a multitude of issues, the main being my dad's death. I've started to unpack what happened the day he died, and reflecting on those thoughts has been one I've tried to avoid.

A handful of replies here are, interesting... But mostly you all have been level-headed about this. Thank you for that. I do plan to tell my therapist about this when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] ready to confront this issue,",6965
n06577,1619581427.0,2021-04-28 03:43:47,TrueOffMyChest,Someone I barely knew killed himself and only I know why.," 

I had to create a throwaway account for this because some friends know of my actual account.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a very social person, ever since I was little. Not so much either now even after joining the military. I haven't really had anyone to talk to about this because I respect his privacy, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Maybe someone out there could help me understand.

This happened a little bit ago. Let's call him Clark. Clark rolled into the unit a little bit after me and went through the usual hazing stuff that people tend to ignore. Extra fire watch, working parties, making him drink some of the homemade mystery brews, etc. But to me, he was quite an extroverted guy. He seemed to get along quite well with his fire team, and never caused any noticeable trouble. I rarely talked to him besides the occasional ""what's up?"", as he was from another platoon. Pretty much the most I talked to him at this point was when I was helping him check in.

Fast forward about half a year, when we're doing some training exercises in the field. I noticed he was sitting a little distant from his team and I happened to walk past him and saw a sketchbook in his lap. Later that day, I walked up to him because I like to draw too. We sparked up a conversation and it felt like we could be genuinely close friends. He showed me the rest of the pages in his sketchbook which were filled with mostly landscape sketches, and they were beautiful.

The following week, I was at a bar with some of my buds, where I saw Clark walk in alone. We made eye contact and I gave a little nod. Later that night, I was sitting on the curb outside because I felt like shit, and then Clark sat down next to me. This is the part that I regret the most because I was honestly barely listening to him when he was talking to me. I do remember bits of what he said but again, I don't want to spill it out of respect for him. He helped me into an uber and we got back to the barracks, where he helped me back to my room.

I distinctly remember walking up the steps with my arm on his back and he told me that he appreciated me but to not tell people what he told me. He said he didn't want his mother to know what he was dealing with. The last thing I ever said to him was ""Whatever man"".

He went UA the next day until they found him a few hours away with a bullet through his head, right outside of his hometown. Only after I found out that he died did I realize that what he was telling me the night before was really heavy. He told me about some tragic events that happened to him in the past few months. All he wanted was someone to listen to him or maybe talk him out of it, but I just had to be a little too drunk that night.

I've been keeping it to myself that he was giving me warning signs of suicide because I can't face his family or his friends, telling them that I knew this whole time that something was off about him the day before.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if I should tell anyone at my unit about this, but I guess I just wanted someone to know my story.",208

14n3u4r,1688139592.0,2023-06-30 15:39:52,TrueOffMyChest,I was kidnapped by my childhood best friend and her mom without realizing it.,"My mom suggested I could share my story to raise awareness but the truth is that if it wasn't for her I probably wouldn't have even seen it as kidnapping. If you expect a dramatic story filled with abuse and torture I have to disappoint you. I think its not a bad idea to share my story and since I love reddit I decided to share it here. I figured that this subreddit might be the best one to do so. Using a throwaway for this as I only want to raise awareness for this without going further into it and having my main account associated with this story.

But lets get to the story. This happened when I was in elementary school. Like for most children at that age boys and girls were somehow rivals. Me and my best friend, lets call her Lisa (fake name) however singlehandedly destroyed that stereotype. She was pretty much the exact female copy of me. Our interests aligned so well that we quickly became best friends. The day it happened I asked my mom to stay at Lisa's house for the night.

She said yes and I packed the stuff I needed. I was only prepared to stay there for one night. But one night turned into a week. When I arrived there we had a great time playing video games, doing roleplay with our toys and playing hide and seek at night. It was much fun. The next morning I prepared for my mom to get me but this was when Lisa's mom told me that my mom had called her and told her that I had to stay at their house for a bit longer. Being the naive young child I was I didn't question it. Yes I was confused but this only made me realize that I could spent more time with Lisa so for me it wasn't a problem.

This was at a time where I didn't possess a smartphone so its not like my mom could've just call me. I stayed there for an entire week before I started to question why my mom hasn't got me yet. I wasn't allowed to leave the house either. I was only allowed in the house and the garden outside. When me and Lisa played outside a neighbour saw me and called the cops. It turned out that my mom filed a missing report at the police station because I was missing for a few days.

It turned out that my mom had actually tried to get me after the first night. But when she tried to Lisa's mom told her that I already left and that apparently I told her I wanted to walk home when she offered me to give me a ride. Lisa's mom was such a sweet person that no one would've ever suspected her of doing something like this so even my mom figured that someone had to kidnap me on my way home so she filed the report.

The police reunited me with my mom and I was confused as hell. I had a great time there. Yes I was a bit worried why my mom never got me but I couldn't understand back then why Lisa's mom was arrested. This happened during summerbreak and I didn't see Lisa during the summerbreak. And she also didn't appear at school on the first day. I have no idea what happened to her. Right now I assume that this incident ruined their reputation so much that they moved away and I never saw Lisa again.

Like I said its not a typical kidnapping story. It all was so sneaky that not even I as the alleged victim could tell that it was one but my mom insists that it was a kidnapping. So yeah thats it. I still don't know if labeling myself as a victim here would be right because I just don't feel like one. But thats just me.

EDIT: Want to clarify something. I was a child with the attention span of a fly and tell this story based on what I remember and what my mom told me. I assume that if my mom told the police the same thing Lisa's mom told her the police maybe didn't focus that much on Lisa's mom and if they did they might have just taken a witness statement of her at the door and then its not far fetched I didn't notice it. Especially since I was at Lisa's room most of the time and was focused on the games we played. This is also why I didn't notice when my mom tried to get me after the first night.

Just wanted to clarify this because some people call my story fake because the police wasn't investigating Lisa's house from what I could remember.",8119

I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] ugly, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] fat, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] badly dressed. But it's up to men to seduce, to go for it, to put their emotions in danger. And it's up to them to be the bad guy and refuse a ""let's stay friends"" (edit: here, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] saying men have to push for it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] they have to be the one who refuse to stay friends and leave. And be the asshole...)

Obviously, someone is going to say ""aCtuAlly, iT wAs veRY hARD for me tO get A daTe"". Damn, obviously there is exceptions. Obviously there is people who have bad luck, who only meet bad people.

Yep. I just wanted to whine about my shitty life. Thanks for reading.

Edit: someone pointed out I was blaming women. I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Exactly like I can't relate to their situation, they can't relate to mine. Which is okay. It took me some time to make her understand how it works.

Another edit: everyone is telling me women don't care that much about looks. I know, that's not the point. Looks is just the first impression. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] talking about attention, validation. About having a chance to date. Obviously, in the long run, a pretty guy with awful personality will get dumped.

Another edit: I tried tinder during a month, that's all, I deleted it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about my daily life.

And another fucking edit: could you please stop bringing the murder and the rape into the debate ? Murder and rapes aren't ""normal"", it's not okay, it's not a good thing to do.

But men chasing and women choosing is ""normal"". That's what I dislike.",8017

I am a 22M Indian.

Let's start this story in the very beginning. I promise that all of it is relevant.

Due to my father's job, we moved around a lot and I spent a significant amount of time living in the US.

When I was 13 and in 8th grade, I met this girl, who I will call R. R was really beautiful and I was smitten, but felt
that she was out of my league, so I didn't try to initiate any conversations with her. Later, she found my school-given
Gmail ID (it's really easy to reverse-engineer it if you know the person's name), and we started chatting on Google Chat.
Over time, we shared a lot of stuff with each other and became very close.

It became normal for us to chat for a few hours after school ended. We were both angsty teenagers so we shared lots
of messages like, ""Ugh, they don't get it, but you do. You're special."" But I did it more. For my 14th birthday, she
gave me a drawing she did herself, with a screenshot on the back. The screenshot was from of a part of one of our
conversations where she said I was her best friend.

When I brought that drawing back from school, and hung it up on my wall, my mom looked at it, and made some comment that
I've forgotten by now. She also pointed out a spelling mistake in the drawing. I didn't have the heart or courage to tell
her that it was not a spelling mistake, but rather an inside joke type of thing. My mom never looked at the back, and I
didn't point out that there was something on the back too.

Fast-forward to the end of 8th grade. At that time, I used to go for tutoring. It wasn't remedial, but rather to keep me
ahead of my grade level like I already was. One day, I had gone for tutoring, and on the ride back home, my father was
super quiet, quieter than usual. I felt that something might be off, but I could not remember anything that I had done
wrong, so I brushed it off. After an equally quiet dinner with both of my parents, I went to my room to wind down for
the night.

My mom walked in, and sat down in the chair. She asked me who R was to me. My heart froze. She had asked me about her
once before, when I brought home that drawing from school. I knew I was in deep, deep shit. I must have tried my best
to downplay it and said ""Just some girl from school"". But my mom wasn't having any of it.

My mom went completely ballistic on me. She told me that she had been using the computer, when she found that I was
still signed into my (school-provided) Gmail. As any Indian mother would, she decided to go in and take a look around.
She found me and R's Google Chat, and read it. To this day, I don't know how much she read, because she didn't tell me
that day, nor did we ever talk about that day after the fact.

My mom asked me that if R was my gf, and if I dreamt about a future with her. Full disclosure: I did, but in the stupid,
ideal, 14 yo kind of way. It didn't mean anything. She told me that she had sacrificed so much for me, cared for me, fed
me, took care of me, and that I was not allowed to repay all her efforts and sacrifices in this way. She guilt-tripped me
hard, and started crying. No child wants to see their parent cry, much less be the reason that their parent is upset, so
naturally, I started bawling too. At some point, my father came in to see what all the commotion was about, saw both of us
crying, and walked away.

My mom forbade me from having any sort of contact with this girl. She told me that at my age and stage of life, my sole duty
was to study and be a very good student. She also told me that she was planning to do me a favor and let me choose my SO when
the time came, and that she wouldn't try to impose with her choice. She also told me that there would be no dating or any of
that nonsense until college, at least.

After this incident, I went no-contact with R. At this point, summer had already started, so I had no way of telling her
what had happened. Naturally, since I wasn't reading or replying to her messages, or coming online at all, she felt that
she had done something wrong, and started becoming worried and upset.

One time, by sheer coincidence, R and I crossed paths. I had gone to the mall with my family, and she had also gone to the
mall on the same day. Both of us, and our families, decided to go the food court at the exact same time. I think I noticed
her first, and prayed to god that she wouldn't notice me. Much to my dismay, she did, and waved and came and said hi. I
tried to say as little and look her way as little as possible, because of my mom. I think my mom just found the whole
situation amusing and just asked me about her family a little.

I will never forget what she asked, and the little conversation we had. She discreetly pointed to another girl that was
with them and asked who that was. I said it was her sister. Then she asked, ""Older sister or younger sister?"" in our
native language. Since we had left India when I was relatively young, my grasp of our native language was not that great,
and to me, the words for ""older sister"" and ""younger sister"" both simply meant ""sister"". I had to ask my mom for
clarification, after which I told her that that person was her older sister.

I would get to know much later, that R wanted me to sit with her and her family. I would have loved to do that, if I were
not with my family. If I pulled this kind of stunt while with my family, I don't think I would have survived the encounter.

I think that I should mention, at this point, that R was also Indian. She was unlike me, though, because she had been born
and raised in the US. She was also from South India, whereas I am [REDACTED_NAME]. An interesting detail is that I remember once having
a conversation with my mom where she mentioned in passing that she doesn't like South Indians that much. (To be completely
fair to her, she followed it up by saying that she has a general predisposition to disliking them, but it's not written in
stone, and pointed out a couple of close family friends who are South Indian.)

I remember lying in bed one night, and wondering how I ever got myself into a situation like this, where two of the most
important women in my life were hurt by my actions.

Anyways, back to the story: I knew that going no-contact would not work, nor would it be a good thing. Near the end of
8th grade, we had exchanged private emails so that we could keep our tradition of talking over Google Chat. One early
morning, I fired off a few messages from my private email, telling her that I was alright, I wasn't ignoring her messages
on purpose, and I assured her that I wasn't angry at her.

Now, during the end of 8th grade, there was a magnet school that advertised themselves. We had to apply if we wanted to go
there, and they had a written test and an interview and everything. Naturally, my parents wanted me to apply. I remember
having the thought of throwing the test if R was not applying. Needless to say, I never had to act on that silly thought
because, since R is also Indian, she also took academics very seriously and was trying to get in.

In the end, both of us got in. As a part of their program, they had a summer school portion. We had to do a bunch of summer
homework, and attend summer school classes with the whole group. She had asked me on the first day, whether I wanted to
carpool with her. Of course, I would have LOVED to do that. But asking my parents was the hard part. That day, I worked up
the courage to ask my dad if he was open to carpooling with R. My dad pretended not to hear my question.


My dad had not participated that night, when my mom guilt-tripped, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] certain he knew her name. A few days later,
he came up to me and asked me if R still wanted to carpool. By that time, she had already found a different person to carpool
with. The relief on his face was obvious. My dad never got involved in this kind of thing, and just let my mom handle it, which
she was more than happy to do. To agree to a carpool for me and R would mean going against my mom, which he was not keen to do
in the least.

Now, we will fast forward the story quite a bit to when I was 15. This was near the end of 9th grade. At this time, R and I had
drifted apart a little, because she was busy with schoolwork, sports, this and that, and had many new friends. And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the
strain I put on our friendship/relationship with my no-contact, my mom, and everything, didn't help in the slightest.

My dad had come to the US, with us, on a H1B visa. That kind of a visa can only be renewed a certain number of times, and we had
hit the maximum number of renews. His company had also promised to try for a green card, which fell through. For this reason, we
would have to leave the US soon and go back to India.

Both R and I considered the other person to be very intelligent, so we had made a promise to go to the same college together, or
at the very least, go to a world-renowned college like MIT.

In a cruel twist of fate, our flight back to India was like a week after my 15th birthday. R had made my 14th birthday very
special. She was the first person, who was not a part of my family, who ever did something for me. I had plenty to look forward
to during my 15th birthday, because she was there. But because of my impending return to India, I did not enjoy the day at all.

When faced with high stakes situations, I have a huge tendency to ignore the problem and pretend it doesn't exist. (This is a theme
that will keep recurring throughout my story.) As a result, I had told R about this situation of mine very late. I had like a month
left in the US, by the time I told her.

She had been quite busy in the intervening time. On my birthday, she did not wish me in the morning, like I expected. But during
lunch, she got my male best friend to hang around with me and maneuver me into a classroom where people often spent the Lunch
period in. There, she had brought in a chocolate cake, and had a bunch of people ready to wish me. A surprise birthday party in
school.

For my birthday present, she also gave me a bag. In the bag, there was a drawing of a dog, because I LOVED dogs and had told her
that multiple times. She also had put a blue scrapbook in there. Blue because it's my favorite color. Inside the scrapbook, there
was a picture of our magnet high school class, a few reminders of the funniest moments of our school year, and a bunch of other
things. At the end, there was a CD. When I got home, I watched the video on the CD. (I rewatched it while I writing this) It was
a compilation of goodbye and sending-off messages, and a few reminders of the funniest and best moments from the school year.

After I came to India, me and R didn't get to talk much because she was quite busy with extracurriculars and school and stuff.
After 10th grade finished and 11th grade started, I got into JEE prep and all that fun stuff. By this time, R and I barely talked.
I, in my foolish-ness, expected 8th grade and 9th grade levels of interaction from her, without considering the fact that she had
many things to do and take care of.

As I went through JEE prep, I started to be jealous of her and resent the easy life my friends have over in the US. At some point,
I had the incredibly toxic and stupid idea to write a goodbye message to her and basically isolate myself (ghost her) for a period
of time, focus on JEE, and then reestablish contact after all that JEE stuff was done.

It was a stupid idea on multiple fronts. On the one hand, it never worked as intended because she was often on my mind, wondering
what she was up to, mentally doing the time zone conversion and then going ""Ah, they would be waking up/in school/whatever right
now"", and in general just having mental breakdowns. I would often put on this little sad song playlist I had, look at the
scrapbook she gave me, and bawl my eyes out.

During this JEE prep time, my parents mostly gave me free reign. After the initial incident with how my mom reacted to my Google
Chat with R, I never shared any of this or any of these thoughts with either parent. They had no idea that any of this was
happening.

Fast forward to 2020. I am 17. I had taken one crack at JEE Mains, and it was alright. But COVID came and wrecked all my plans. JEE
Advanced usually happened in May, so I had promised myself that all this would be over by May 2020. After COVID happened, I ended
up opening our Messenger chat (that was our mode of communication at that point) earlier than expected. Since the competitive
exams had been indefinitely postponed, I had a lot of time on my hands. I spent a couple of days just typing away and updating
her on the stuff that I had been through, the stuff I had learned, and just geeking out over certain topics. We also had a few
heart-to-heart conversations with her.

I had gotten to know that R got into a very very good college. I wasn't surprised, and didn't react with much surprise or anything
really, which upset her. I know I tried to explain myself a few times, but I don't know if she accepted it. I had naively thought
that talking with her would magically solve my own feelings of inadequacy, envy, and insecurity.

I had done a lot of research into the world rankings of the IITs at the time, and knew that according to QS, etc., they did not
match, or even come close, to the level of the top institutions in the US.

I unwittingly let these negative emotions simmer inside me. It eventually converted into anger towards R, despite the fact that
she had done nothing wrong (and in fact, done everything right over the course of our friendship), and insecurity that she had
forgotten all about me and our times together and everything.

I remember one specific moment, when my birthday was near, I was feeling quite upset in general, and asked if she even remembered
when that was. She sent back a picture over her planner, with a specific marker for my birthday. I remember this because I felt
so bad in the moment, and I thought back to this moment many times over the years.

During this COVID time, our conversations, whenever they happened, were toxic (due to me). On top of this, I think she was
dealing with a few things at home (parents in declining health), but I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure. Fast-forwarding a bit, what ultimately ended
up happening, was that we watched an anime ""together"" (can't group-watch due to my parents, so we just watched on our own time and
discussed and shared thoughts). It was a small 22 episode one. As we progressed in the anime, she talked with me less and less,
and by the end, she stopped talking altogether.

At the time, I resented her for doing this to me. But over time, I realized that she had done the right thing, and I just wish
we could start over. She was, and still is (I stalk her LinkedIn and other random stuff every now and then), an amazing girl and
I feel stupid for letting someone like her get away over stupid things like my own insecurities and other unhealthy emotions.

I don't know if I'll ever meet another girl like her, and I honestly don't think I will. Even if I do, it's highly unlikely that
they would give me the time of day or a fraction of the attention that R gave me. I sorely miss R and hate myself for screwing
this up with her. I have no one but myself to blame.

Shortly after R went no-contact with me, I was feeling like shit, and once just completely broke down, in front of my parents.
My mom consoled me and asked me what was wrong. Partially due to the past trauma about her reaction to R, I just told her that I
was worried about not getting into a good college. This was partially true. It was a combination of R leaving and the uncertainty
looming over my head due to the competitive exams being postponed.


Let's talk about the other half of the story: Ultimately, I ended up going to a pretty prestigious college in India. However,
I picked the wrong major. Since we have to choose our major before joining, I picked Mathematics as I was always interested in
that.

Since the 1st year of courses is common for everyone, regardless of their chosen major, I don't have much to say about that period.
In the 3rd semester, I had taken up a CS minor course and was doing fine and on track. However, during the final exams for Real
Analysis, I realized that I was screwed.

Ultimately, a significant portion of our class ended up failing that course, myself included. It was a huge hit to my confidence,
and everything just spiraled downwards from there. Our 3rd semester is one of the hardest in our curriculum. I failed Real
Analysis, and barely scraped by in Algebra.

I did the summer course and ended up with no backlog as the summer finished. But I never told my parents about this. For some
reason, they neve really questioned it. 4th semester went by fine, but at this point, my confidence was shattered and I was
unable to keep the GPA required to continue the highly competitive CS minor. I decided to cross that bridge (of answering why my
degree doesn't say ""with a Minor in CS"") when I came to it.

In the 5th semester, I failed another course: This time it was Probability. I hate myself for failing that course: It was easy and
there is simply no excuse, especially because I ended up taking CS courses in the future which require advanced probability, in
which I did fine. Maybe it was the difference between ""mathematical probability"" and ""CS probability"", where a lot of things are
hand-waved.

In the 6th semester, we had another Algebra course which builds on the basic one we had before. I was flailing in that course too,
and I knew it. The professor caught wind of this because we had weekly tests in this course. All the previous courses were mostly
high-stakes midterm and final exam courses. The only reason I had passed the basic Algebra course was because it was the only other
weekly exam course.

The professor had noticed that I had gotten basically 0 points accumulated in the course so far, despite having had 3 exams or so.
He took me into his office and ripped into me. He told me that I was not taking this seriously and that I needed to get my
priorities straight or just not show up in the first place. After this session with the professor, I walked back to my room as fast
as I could, and cried.

Prior to this intervention, it hadn't occurred to me that not showing up was an option. I started not showing up for math exams and
stuff because my confidence in math had been beyond shattered and since I have the tendency to not face serious problems head on, I
was just pretending that it wasn't an issue until the exam. It was a never ending cycle.

I barely scraped by, and in the 7th semester, a (different) professor caught on that there was something up with me, and I ended up
explaining my whole situation to him. I told him that my parents also were not aware of this, because I was sure they would be
disappointed and disown me or something. He assured me that that would not happen.

Due to the way the math curriculum is structured at my institute, there simply isn't that much opportunity to take non-math courses,
and a lot of it is gate-keeped: It is either not open to non-CS people at all, like all the foundational CS courses, or it's only
for non-CS people with really high GPAs. However, ironically, the higher CS courses aren't locked to outsiders: I ended up taking a
course on advanced microarchitecture and doing quite well on that course. It helped me regain a little of my confidence. We had to
do a final project in groups, and the professor was interested in our group project and was interested in taking it further as a
project under him even after the course.

I was ecstatic as this could be my break. However, during grading, he assigned a grade that meant ""exceeds expectations"" to the 2
other group members, even though I was the one who did by far the most work on that project. When we spoke to him about it, he
decided that we were being insubordinate and that he did not want to work with such people who were grade-whores.

I normally am not too keen on grades, but I really needed this to show my parents that I was good at CS. I initially did not tell
my parents about this potential project, because I wanted to surprise them with the good news, and when it went south, I ended up
not telling them about it all.

I ended up killing a great opportunity because I didn't discuss this matter over with my parents, and because I felt that there
was a sense of justice in this world. What little confidence I had gotten from the course lasted all of, like, 5 days.

During the 8th semester, the shock from the previous semester, and the constant pressure and questions from my parents about what
my plans are after this, it didn't go too well.

Ultimately, at some point during the 8th semester, I took the help of that professor and came clean to my parents. As expected, my
mom was very angry and barely talks to me anymore. My dad, however, was very understanding. Before my confession, my mom would call
quite often, and would be the one checking up on me and asking me how I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. After my confession, she never calls anymore, and
my dad is the one calling and checking up on me. I don't deserve a parent like him.

When all this said and done, I am [REDACTED_NAME] to take one extra semester to complete my degree requirements.

In the end, I hate myself because I failed so many courses and made mistakes at every step of my college journey. My dad has been
telling me to take a look at the future and plan what's next. I've been looking, and my grades are so low that no university is
going to want me, let alone in a hot field like CS, which everyone and their mother is doing and trying to get into.

I feel like a fraud and a far cry from the person who I started out as, when I started in this institute. Since my institute is
reputed, I feel a huge shame in the prospect of having to perhaps having to go a ""worse"" institute, and not even having a shot
at the big names.

I failed myself, my parents, who came from nothing and worked so hard to give their kids a better chance, I was unable to keep
the promise I made to R, and ultimately I'm [REDACTED_NAME] one who has to live with the decisions and the impacts of the choices that I
made.

I feel lost and trapped, and I don't know what to do.",4

I was seven. The kind of age where you are old enough to remember things forever but still too young to make sense of anything. I was in my village, surrounded by family, surrounded by faith, and surrounded by that atmosphere of celebration that usually makes kids excited. But not that day.

A camel stood there, tied, towering, breathing like it knew something was coming. And it did. Everyone around me smiled and chanted prayers. I knew what was going to happen. This was not the first time I’d seen animals being sacrificed. But something about this camel, it had a presence, an awareness. Like it was not just an animal, it was someone.

They laid it down. Forced it, actually. It started shouting. Not crying, shouting. Deep, guttural sounds that did not sound like an animal. They sounded like a language, like a scream that transcended species. Something that every human soul should be able to understand, “Please.”

I turned around. I could not bear to look. But ears do not have eyelids. I heard it all. Its final scream. That moment carved itself into my brain like a scar. It was not the blood. It was not the knife. It was that sound, that helpless, hopeless scream that told me I was standing in the middle of a ritual where nobody else heard what I heard.

I was a devout Muslim at that time. Prayed five times, fasted, read the Quran. I believed. I really believed. But after that day, I could not eat meat again. Not camel. Not goat. Not cow. Nothing. I did not say anything dramatic. I did not protest. I just refused to chew death. Even as a child, it felt like betrayal. There is this quote, I do not even remember who said it but it lives in my head:
“Animals are my friends. And I do not eat my friends.”

That sentence became my quiet rebellion.

I am 22 now. Fifteen years. Thousands of occasions. Weddings, birthdays, funerals, Eids, family dinners, school events. The pressure to “just eat a little” was constant. Sometimes soft, sometimes violent. “You are disrespecting the blessing.” “You are insulting the sacrifice.” “Are you even Muslim?” People would mind, roll their eyes, whisper behind my back. But I never broke.

Over time, I noticed something. My refusal to eat meat was the first thing that made my family suspect I was leaving religion. Not the books I read, not the prayers I stopped, not the questions I asked but that. That stubborn, silent choice to not chew a piece of flesh.

Because in their eyes, faith was something you show through rituals. And for me, not participating in that one ritual was louder than any debate I could ever start. It was not logic that pulled me away from religion. It was empathy. It was a scream. It was a dying camel that made me realize that maybe morality is not inherited through scriptures but through experience. Through how much you are willing to feel, even when no one else does.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] here to tell anyone what to eat, what to believe, or how to celebrate. I am [REDACTED_NAME] here, finally putting it into words, something I have carried in silence for 15 years.
I did not stop eating meat because of a trend.
I stopped because a camel screamed like a human and I was the only one who heard it.

Recently I’ve been going there a lot with the intention of buying things that I would find both useful and entertaining. 

Today was different. I was looking for some accessories for my PS5 before witnessing the newest Oculus Rift on the shelf. 

I grew curious and walked over to it and noticed the price wasn’t nearly as bad as I anticipated. After all, VR headsets used to be far more expensive compared to now. Within a minute and no prior knowledge about VR I immediately wanted it. 

The employee told me that they won’t have the 64 GB version in stock until Monday. All that was available was the 256 GB version which was $100 more expensive 

“That’s fine,” I said without hesitation. 

As we reached the register and I got prepared to hand over the cash, another employee walked up to me mentioning how he’s been saving up for a VR headset for awhile now. He even asked questions about it that I had no idea how to answer because I just now found out about it yet here I am [REDACTED_NAME] it. 

This was the same employee who I’ve seen many times before who helped me transport large and heavy items into my vehicle. 

After I paid, I felt guilty. I bought something that took less than a minute of contemplating buying it. All while there are people who save over a period of time to buy this. 

“You can have it.” I told him without hesitation. 

I handed the VR headset over to him and told him that he would have better use of it than me. He was in shock at first before his face lit up and thanked me a million times. 

It felt good. If I were to buy the headset for myself I would have felt the same as before. No incentive for hard work that paid off or something I wanted for a long time. The feeling I got from handing him the headset was the same feeling I longed for when buying things I didn’t even need and never felt any different afterwards.",22086

I want to go and be single. I want to figure out how to have a routine all on my own. I want to go to the gym and clean my house where everything stays where I put it. I want to have a regular sleep schedule. I want to decide when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to move. I want to make friends. I want to be in change of all of my money so I can focus hard on saving and everything. I want to start streaming maybe.. I want to record my music.

I don't want to be in a relationship for a long long long time. Like maybe ever. Omg. I've been so unlucky or maybe just stupid. Both relationships I've been in have left me stuck and feeling unloved and taken advantage of after like 3 years. Is this normal? Is there an expiration date on good relationships?

Idk how or when but it will get better...I think.. oh god..

EDIT: After talking with him he applied for a job that he starts on Wednesday. He explained he thinks he has ADD possibly so we set up an appointment for him to get mental help/medication. Maybe I'll set up an appointment for my own feelings cause now even if he's trying his best I feel really hurt and lonely.. and I guess that's not fair to him.. I feel like we're together just because we're together.. ugh. Thank you all for the really nice comments. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my best",6322
zqxtn5,1671565912.0,2022-12-20 19:51:52,TrueOffMyChest,My brother SAed me when I was a child and now that he is getting married I want to ruin the wedding and expose him,"I (23F) was sexually assaulted by my step brother when I was a child. I don’t remember the exact age because it was never brought up by my parents. I assume i was 4-5 years old and he was in his late teenage years.
I remember very clearly the details of it, and I remember being hit by my parents when they knew.
I’m very upset and mad about it because it affected my sexuality now that I’m grown. 
His wedding is in 2 months, I don’t hate him personally but I hate the fact that he is living his best life with his fiancé and I’m still suffering from the consequences of his actions and my parents neglect. 
This is an intrusive thought but I might expose him for that on the wedding day.
Edit: as I remember it was only once or twice, i had a very traumatic childhood and I have forgotten a lot of things, sorry for the lack of details.

Edit: I read most of the comments, thank you so much for your support
Im glad I posted here because there was a lot of things brought to my attention that didn’t cross my mind before.
As someone said I’m the one who will live the rest of my life with consequences of this action 
and the fiancé has nothing to do with that and she deserves to know privately. 
So now that i feel obligated to let her know, I’m trying to figure out how I’d do it. I will update you when I fully decide on it.",5835
1dawisl,1717828322.0,2024-06-08 06:32:02,TrueOffMyChest,I (17M) was sexually harassed by a staff member at my high-school (Early 30's F) ,"All the good stuff, throw away account, names have been changed, Intentionally vague details. Also this story happened to me 10+ years ago.

This is a story that to this day I've only told parts of to a handful of people. However, enough time has past that i feel it would do me some good to get the full story off my chest. Also sorry about the wall of text, It looks like I’ve spilled the tea and kettle.

TL;DR - Back in the early 2010's I (Then 17 M) received, and subsequently did not accept, sexual advances from a (Then early 30's F) married, pregnant, teachers assistant. I then spent the rest of the school year diffusing the situation.

It was my senior year of high-school in a very small rural town. When i say small i mean that the entire high school consisted of less than 50 students. Julie was the school's new computer lab tech (not sure of actual job title). She was in charge of maintaining the schools computers. Whenever we had a class that we needed to use the computers for, she would help the teacher to monitor us students and make sure no one was playing flash games, or checking social media, etc. Julie had a very ""flirtatious"" vibe. She would regularly have playful conversations with all us students. This was not sexual by any means, more so teasing and poking fun. She acted more like a fellow student with us than a superior. In general, this made lots of students (myself included) enjoy our classes with her as she wasn't as strict and classes weren't boring. Julie was also a mother of 2. Her and her husband (lets call him Dave) moved to town where she found this job and her husband worked in a manual/skilled labourer job. Julie became pregnant shortly into the school year and began showing by the time second semester came around. Little did i know, that that was around the time her opinion of me started to change.

Hindsight tells me that the catalyst for Julie's newfound lust was probably during a ""gender swap"" day the school had during one of the regular ""spirit weeks"" they would put on. The premise of this day was for guys to show up dressed as girls, and vise versa. (I know, very gender binary.) I didn't dress any different but a few did. Julie showed up that day with several very feminine costumes that she had (Think ""sexy"" Halloween costume type of clothing). during breaks she was bugging the male students to show some spirit and put them on. Most of the guys where too cool/embarrassed to oblige. I however, thought that it would at least get a laugh out of Sophie, a good friend. So, I grabbed the skimpiest top and went to the change room. I came out in a very tight, pink, sleeveless, corset style dress with jeans underneath. I went up to George and did a ""Bro, can you do up my corset?"" bit and it got a couple laughs. The memory that sticks in my mind the most from that day is Julie saying something to the effect of ""Wow, you have a strong muscular back"". I guess it's true what they say about giving a guy a compliment and he will remember it for the rest of his life because i still remember the joy that compliment gave me to this day. At that time I was skinny like a string bean having lost a bunch of weight due to puberty and a change in activity so complimenting my defined back while in a tight corset truly was flattering. Anyways, I feel like this was the first comment Julie made to me that crossed a line and possibly planted a seed in her mind. However, at the time i thought nothing of it and just took it as a nice compliment.

Awhile later, Julie began to question me about my current on again/off again relationship with Isabella a fellow student. Now, even from Julie’s outside perspective it was probably very easy to see the signs of a bad relationship. Isabella would regularly string me and other guys along. Julie picked up on this and at an opportune time when i was alone with her, She simply ask “What’s up with you guys?” When i didn’t have a good answer she said something along the lines of “You deserve better” and left it at that. From there, she would proceed to make small remarks like passing her in the hall she would say something like “Hey during chem class i noticed Isabella flirting with Roy.” My oblivious ass still didn’t raise any suspicion or think it was odd that a Staff member was concerning themselves this heavily in high school dating life drama. I thought she was simply looking out for me. One day, my group of friend was in the computer lab over lunch and Julie began complaining about having ordered take-out from the local restaurant but having to walk all the way there and back to get it. I happened to have drove myself to school that day and thought nothing of offering to give her a ride. After all, she was pregnant and i seen it as nothing more than a friendly favour. So we went off school property, just the two of us (I know) and got her lunch. It wasn’t till the return trip when once again she brought up Isabella. I ended up opening up to her a bit about knowing that she’s not right for me but not wanting to hurt her. We pulled back into the school lot as Julie was telling me that I’m “too nice of a guy” I shrugged it off as she turned to me while opening the door and said “You know, nice guys always finish last”. I can’t say for certain what it was about how she said that it, but there was a certain smoulder in that last line. It was at this moment when I began to question the way Julie felt about me. I still didn’t believe it though, Because “of coarse she isn’t in to me”. I once again rationalized this interaction as just her looking out for me which aside form the sexual innuendo, was genuinely relationship advice that i needed to hear at the time.

The next couple weeks pass as normal, aside from me making an effort to distance myself form Isabella. I guess the advice sunk in. One day, during last period I was in the computer lab working on a paper. I was trying my best not to notice Isabella at the far side of the lab. She was sitting next to Roy with her legs across his lap, giggling, and making no effort to hide their new relationship. I had Facebook tabbed and was catching up on my timeline as any kid that wanted to fit in did at the time. I made minimal efforts to hide what I was doing, as Julie was the only one supervising at the time and i knew she was cool about computer use. Out of nowhere, I get a FB message. It’s from Julie who I wasn’t even friends with on the site. She messaged “God, what a bitch” clearly in reference to Isabella. I remember looking over to Julie and her giving a friendly smirk. I responded simply, “Haha, yea” thinking that would be the end of the interaction. It wasn’t. She proceeded to carry on with the conversation. Not wanting to be rude I responded, but was unsure why she was continuing on. Once school ended and I was now home, Julie’s tone became very complimentary as if to butter me up. She then asked me if I’ve ever watched Billy Madison. Having seen the movie, time almost came to a stop as I began to speculate what she was going to say next. She then said something in reference to the hot for teacher plot and how she enjoyed it. My stomach physical churned and i instantly broke out into a cold sweat. I felt sick, I felt wrong, I felt like every molecule of my being was violently rejecting the message I had just read. At this point, it was clear to me. Julie fantasized about having sex with me.

I proceeded to freak out. I wanted nothing to do with any of this. It was wrong to me on so many levels, and worst of all I didn’t know how to get out of it. Through my sheer blindness to pick up on any of the signs, I had let Julie get far to comfortable and get the wrong idea. I was scared to turn her down, as I didn’t know how she’d handle the rejection. Would she not take No as an answer? Would she get scared that i would tell someone and try to get ahead of it by telling Dave(her husband) that I made a move on her? Would she force herself on me, to try and keep me from talking? I just didn’t know. I felt powerless to stop this as I felt that she was the adult here and it would be her word against mine. I couldn’t tell anyone else either. If this ever got out I was sure that cops would get involved and possibly the news. I didn’t want any of that attention. Not to mention, I began to get increasingly scared about Dave. He gave off the vibe of the type of guy that would have no problem resorting to violence upon hearing about his unfaithful wife. Also, I didn’t want to break up a family. What would that do to the kids? I needed a plan of how to best dodge all these bullets, while also protecting myself. I knew that in case things did go bad, what i needed was concrete evidence. While the meaning behind Julie’s message was clear to me, she didn’t outright admit to her intentions. It made me sick to think about, but I knew I had to keep this conversation going until she said something clearly explicit. I began to respond using as few words as i could, also making no comment to say that I agreed or consented. She just kept going eventually saying something along the lines of “I want you to be my muse” and then finally “God, I could just jump you right now”. Felling that this was enough and not being able to handle this conversation anymore, I simply ghosted. I now had my smoking gun.

For the next couple weeks, I made myself scarce. I avoided all interactions with Julie, not even making eye contact. I knew there was safety in numbers, and as long as I stayed in a group of friends she couldn’t try anything. I became very anxious about knowing what my classmates plans where over lunch and breaks to try and keep myself surrounded. My main goal was to let her come to the realization that I wasn’t interested on her own hoping that it would lessen her urge to want to escalate. I also felt that the time might make her come to her senses and realize what she was thinking was wrong in the first place. It didn’t seem to be working, as Julie tried a few times to message me again. My fear was warranted.

I had a class that I took through online correspondence, and so needed to use a computer. I opted to go to the computer lab in the attached elementary school. This is something that a handful of high-schoolers did during periods that the elementary didn't have it booked, and I began to as well since Julie stayed in the high-school lab. It was only myself and a few other classmates at the time when Julie came into the lab and began to hand out flyers for the next school event. I had my chair pushed away from the table and was slightly reclined into it. As she passed behind me instead of placing the flyer on the table by the computer, she reached over my shoulder placing the flyer in my lap. She then let her arm almost go limp and she traced a finger up my chest and slightly tugged at my shirt. I felt utterly scandalized. Not only was I wrong about feeling safe around others, but she clearly wanted to keep pursuing me. I knew i couldn’t avoid her at school.

At this point, I was heavily considering telling my friends. If for no other reason then the fact that I just couldn’t handle the stress. The moment came on a school field trip in which Julie didn’t attend. I was sitting with a small circle of friends and the topic of Julie came up, and not being able to take it anymore I told them my story. I was terrified of getting a bad reaction, of one of the guys trying to down play it or think it was cool, or of someone else urging me that I needed to tell the authorities. The main reaction I had got was skepticism, to which I had the proof. I remember pleading with the group that this secret can’t get out right before showing them the messages. I then watched as my phone got handed around and one by one people realized I was telling the truth.

For the next few days, I was on pins and needles. As you could expect this story travelled like wildfire and before we were even back from the field trip, the whole high-school knew. I didn’t know what to expect. I thought that surely someone was bound to tell their parents, but no one did. I think that everyone came to the same realization of just how nuclear this secret would be if it came out and so it just became a group secret. From then on, it seemed like everything had changed. Any class that I had to be in the computer lab for, I’d notice my friends closer around me. Some of the guys began looking for more opportunities to chat and try flirting with Julie, while I feel that the girls in my grade kept a closer watch on her with judgmental eyes. I’m sure that this change was noticeable enough for Julie to realize what had happened and, realizing that the whole high-school secretly knew, she didn’t make anymore advances towards me.

I don’t know if this is the most satisfying ending to this story, but it’s how it ended non the less. To this day, I don’t think anyone outside of my fellow alumni ever found out. Julie and Dave Stayed together for a few years before divorcing over what I can only assume was his drug problem as he’s been in and out of jail for drug relate crimes ever since.",7
1d1acn4,1716755201.0,2024-05-26 20:26:41,TrueOffMyChest,"This is a letter to Nash, the first person to show me Love. (My perspective), ( Should I text him it.).","# Dear Nash…



# I should start off by explaining myself.. 

Hi I’m Meave (I am 5’3, I have natural dirty blonde hair but I dye my hair black, with Hazel eyes but the kind where you can only tell in natural light.) I work as an assistant general manager of a gym and I am [REDACTED_NAME] nineteen. I moved out of My parents before I turned eighteen so I’ve been on my own for a little bit. Now before this story unfolds, I know these truths : I am [REDACTED_NAME] a good person, I know my actions have consequences, I am [REDACTED_NAME] innocent, I make tons of mistakes and I try my best to learn from everything in my life but I can’t always do that. I am [REDACTED_NAME] writing this for you to sympathize with me, I’m writing it so that you see my perspective. So you (Nash) know how I viewed you this whole time. 



At this point in my life I met Axel, Axel was kind of an accident if you could call him that. Axel would come into the gym every day with his friend Dominic. Starting off I had a big crush on Dominic (Dominic was 5 '5 Blonde hair, Baby Blue eyes and to best describe it he had a medium build.) The minute Dominic would step in the building my face would be so red it was obvious I was flustered. I gave Dominic my snapchat and he added me a week later, we talked and I tried flirting with him. It worked because he flirted back but I never got asked out, I was confused. Until he posted a picture of him and his girlfriend. I was shocked. I didn't know what to do and out of embarrassment, and the feeling of being undesirable I texted Axel on Facebook. Axel asked me for my snapchat and on Snapchat asked me questions about myself, truly got to know me and flirted with me. He asked for a “tattoo tour” Which I told him I could do but would be slightly inappropriate. He said it was preferred that way which was obvious his intentions at that point. The next day Axel and I hung out. Axel kissed me the Minute I stepped out of the car, I said “oh wow I never did this before so I thought this was going to be awkward..” Axel responded with “There is no awkwardness when it comes to me, don't worry.” After we would “hang out"" He brought me a glass of water and asked me if I wanted any fruits, which was an odd question to me because I didn't think that was normal I guess. I only ever had strawberries, kiwis, grapes and bananas so when he offered me blueberries I had to shamefully tell him how I never had them before. He brought me some and told me not to worry if I didn’t like them he would eat them. I actually enjoyed them. After that night it kinda became our thing, I believe we roughly met up three more times; Spanning over a couple of weeks. Every Time I saw him He gave me a new fruit, I might have actually developed feelings overtime for him. As I prefer to have permanent connections with people but that was only if I could get past his looks and focus on his personality. Problem was his personality, his narcissistic tendencies were only reminding me of Orion (Orion was my first boyfriend and ex-fiance.. Yes I was engaged. He was 6’2, Blonde hair and he had ocean blue eyes, but this isn’t about Orion let's get back to the story at hand). At one point Axel even called his mom, flipping out because he couldn’t get the netflix login to show me the new batman movie. I was definitely grossed out but I left it alone because we weren’t together. Me and Axel stopped hanging out for a good month or more at this point ( I had told my friends that he had given me the ick way too many times), I decided to drive up to New York to get my adopted sister Celeste, Celeste was beautiful but had a tough upbringing. I thought I could help her by bringing her home. I think I wanted to help Celeste more than she ever wanted from me though if I’m honest. The first month of Celeste being in town she made tons of friends, one of them made music his name was Dean. I finished up my workshift one night and randomly called Celeste asking her to come with me to Walmart, which was odd since it would require me to backtrack but something told me I needed her. She agreed, which she usually doesn’t like to do, so I feel this moment was fate. We were leaving walmart when Dean was entering, Dean was with a friend, He produced for Dean. His name was Nash, Nash and Dean were excited to talk to celeste as they had been talking about making a song recently. I was busy and uninterested so I walked to my car, I realized I shouldn’t be leaving Celeste with two random men, so I put my bags in the car and walked back over. I walked into their conversation asking Celeste to come over that night to make a song (it was already ten at night). She looked at me pleadingly and asked me to go too. I agreed because I would never leave a female alone with two men. So we left to go to Nash’s Studio

 We got to Nash’s Studio and I was trying to convince Celeste to talk to Nash since I thought he was cute. Nash (He had long blonde hair with blue eyes, but Nash would always say his eyes were gray not blue) I found him to be the most intriguing human I had ever met, I always hated long hair on men, but I loved him the way he was when I met him. Now Celeste had reminded me she had a boyfriend, she was frustrated with me. So I told her I was sorry and I then proceeded to introduce myself to Nash. I might be delusional but I could swear I saw his eyes light up when I sat next to him. I asked Nash about his profession, I asked him how he got into music and if he ever made his own songs. Nash showed me his songs but he swore he hated them, I reassured him. I asked him how he did it and he explained the whole process. Nash and I stayed up until five in the morning on a work night talking about everything. We clicked immediately, we had so much in common. Both being middle children with terrible past relationships. Nash was caring and considerate. Nash asked me where I worked and if I knew his brother, when he said Axel's name I knew…I didn’t think Nash had shared feelings for me so I didn’t tell him of the past I shared with Axel. I left that night and I brought home with me an understanding of spiritual intimacy, I felt understood for once in my life. Nash then texted me the next day asking if he could hear me sing something in his studio that night. I told him how I had stage fright so it had to be just him “I trust your producer ears” I said. He sent me a smiley face and agreed. Later that night he told me had to go pick up his friend from the airport and had to cancel but he texted me stating “unless you want to ride to the airport, which could be really boring”. I told him I kind of just wanted to talk to him more so I was okay with going with him. He picked me up in his moms car, he seemed nervous as he tried to figure out his GPS but also excited. He told me straight outwardly that he had feelings for me. I was shocked, I had never been with someone so sure of their own feelings. I told him I was interested in pursuing him as well, he had put his hand on my lap. I was so giddy, I believed this would last. Everything was great until the realization of Nash and Axel having the same last name….. I told Nash that I was friends with his brother. They were brothers, I would be wrong to keep it from him. That night as it came to an end, Nash and I somehow ended up on his couch cuddling, we even shared a kiss. My whole work shift I was thinking about the kiss Nash and I shared, and the elephant in the room. By the end of my shift I knew I had to tell Nash and I knew what that meant. I was crying my whole shift. I texted Nash and told him we needed to talk about something Important, in person. He questioned me and he was nervous, I felt like shit. By the end of the night I got to his house and we sat down in his studio. I couldn’t look him in the face, I was ashamed. I started to cry and told him I didn't want him to feel bad just because I was crying. I then told him about me and Axel’s past. To my dismay Nash cried. He was just as hurt as me, I apologized and told him I was a terrible person. How I was trying to follow my faith more and I keep falling further and further from it. Nash told me that he hoped I could understand but he couldn’t facilitate a relationship with someone  who once found his brother attractive. I shook my head, I asked him if we could at least be friends as I truly valued him as a friend. He said he needed time because it's hard for him to be friends with someone he had feelings for. I told him I understood and I left, we didn't speak all day. I cried my whole work shift, after work I started painting the house I just bought, my first night in the house. Nash texted me and asked if he could drop off celestes chargers and if we could talk when he got here. I agreed. Nash pulled in and we went for a drive, Nash asked me about Mine and Axel’s past. He asked if I ever had feelings for Axel and wanted to be with him. I expressed to him how Axel wasn’t my personality type, so I would never be interested. I expressed How he was barely even my type and I did it out of slight desperation. Nash and I talked for thirty minutes about this, He then brought me home and came inside with me. Nash and I sat on the floor of my empty living room, talking about everything. We laid down and stared at my ceiling, Nash said he felt pathetic. I asked why and he stated “I’ve been trying to feel bothered by you and Axel, but I can't. I think you truly regret it and I want to be with you”. I responded stating 'you're not pathetic, you are caring.’ Nash then kissed me. I thought time stopped and That's all I wanted, I wanted to be stuck in that moment forever.

 Everytime Nash kissed me, he would grab my face with both his hands as if I was the most fragile thing in the world. Nash and I spent everyday together. We went to Dean's house together and I signed Dean's pizza poster. Dean said I’m an official friend so I was allowed, Dean was a great friend during all of this. I was hanging out with Nash one day and my dad called me asking to pick up his groceries because he started drinking and forgot. I asked Nash if it was okay and he agreed. I was slightly panicked because my father had never met any of my boyfriends before. Not even my Ex-fiancé. Nash helped carry the bags in and shook my dads hand. My dad, being old him, was drunk and gave Nash his whole life's story… My dad told Nash how he dropped out in high school to take care of my mother and her newborn. I watched as Nash got excited, and asked what grade he dropped out. Nash found out they both dropped out Junior year, Nash was worried my dad would judge him for it and was relieved to hear my dad wasn't going to be disappointed. It made me happy to see my dad and Nash getting to know each other, it all felt real after that. 



Nash and I shared so many special and important moments, we had so many serious conversations and started to build a real foundation to our relationship. I was hypersexual and Nash realized it quickly.. He didn't have a problem with it and he actually stated how he would have to be the one in past relationships to introduce the intimate parts of the relationship. Making him feel undesirable. One night I was cuddling Nash and asked if we could be intimate; He looked at me and asked me if I had ever been shown love without the expectation of more. I thought for a second and realized I hadn’t, so I replied with a simple “no”. He said “let's just cuddle and watch movies tonight. I don't want you to feel like all I want you for is intimacy.” I didn’t realize until after reflecting on our conversations Nash thought I regretted being with him, Which he was so utterly wrong about. I know I made him feel that way when I would cry about us not being “official” but sleeping together. Nash said he had been thinking about it a lot and I didn't realize what kind of damage I did by wording it that way. I never regretted him, I regretted Axel and I was full of shame. I just wanted to be with Nash and not keep it a secret. Nash tried to tell Axel, Axel reacted badly. Nash said “Maeve is coming over tonight…” This was the first time Axel found out we were hanging out. Axel’s face turned red and he responded with “You know I F\*cked her right?!”. Nash was slightly embarrassed and said “yea, she told me.” Axel said “Did you f\*ck her…” Nash sighed “yes..”. I didn't know this was the conversation when I walked in.. Axel looked me dead in the eyes and said “speak of the devil''. I awkwardly chuckled and said “hi”. Axel and Nash wrapped up their conversation and I went with Nash into his room. Nash and I were talking when Axel yelled for him.. From the other room Axel asked Nash to not let me spend the night.. When Nash told me I felt disgusted and Ashamed, I guess that was the point for Axel. Which I should have expected, Axel was a narcissist and there was no hiding that side of him, I could tell he didn't know he was though. I damaged Axels Ego because without the knowledge of Nash. I texted Axel the night I told Nash everything and I told Axel how I was feeling.. I said to Axel “I just wanna be honest with you really quickly. Hanging Out with Nash I developed feelings for him, I already told him about us hooking up, which means he no longer wants to be involved with me, with that being said I cannot ever see you again. Knowing how I feel now. You're a good person but I genuinely feel I wish I had met Nash before ever meeting you. I apologize for everything.” Axel screenshotted my message that night.. I thought he sent it to Nash but Nash told me he never got that message from Axel so he didn't even know I had sent it. I think I broke Axel's ego that night, and I severely pissed him off. 

Axel’s reactions to My relationship with Nash was the beginning to our end. Nash wasn’t willing to hinder his relationship with his brother as Nash worked with Axel and lived with him. I couldn’t even be mad, I knew our relationship was a long shot to begin with but I was a hopeless romantic. Nash gave me hope…. Until Nash and I were cuddling on my couch about to pass out when Nash got up to leave. I asked Nash why he could stay and he stated he didn't want Axel to know where he was.. I was angry. I told Nash he was just delaying the inevitable at this point then. I said if he never talked to Axel then we aren't going to work out. Nash saw a tear streaming down my face and sat back down. He said “you’re right. I thought this fork in the road was going to be something we could get past but Axel isn’t bugging.” He paused and said “ I feel like I’m leading you on”. I started to Bawl my eyes out, I stopped talking. Nash asked me to stand up and I shook my head no. I felt too vulnerable to stand. Nash said “can I sit with you then?” I shook my head yes. He sat next to me and held me while I cried. I mustered up the courage to say “I feel like I’m being punished” The tears ran faster down my face, then I felt Nash gasp and start crying out “I think I’m being punished too”. We cried together. Both aching. I thought this can't be the end. We cried for a bit and Nash had to leave before things felt worse. I stopped Nash from leaving and placed my house key in his hand. I said “Please talk to Axel, just tell him I want to be in a relationship with you and if he reacts badly blame me for being crazy. If you get through to him instead then there is no harm. Keep my key and if it goes bad you can bring it back, but if there's still a chance of us being together, keep it.” He hesitantly agreed. Now I want to say that was the last time I saw Nash face to face, but I did end up seeing him one more time. Nash stopped making plans and efforts to see me after our conversation, things just slightly changed. When I asked him what was going on, he simply stated “I’m just really busy with work this week”. So I trusted it was that, I gave it time and in hopes he would make an effort to reach out. I heard nothing back, I got snapchat clips here and there of what he was doing but there was a lack of interest in keeping conversation. I was distraught. I told my therapist and she told me to give him that week in case it really is work and the stress of having two jobs, so I did. I ended up visiting my cousin Jackie and her boyfriend. They always welcomed me into their home with open arms, Jacklyn's boyfriend Trevor had edibles when I got there and asked me if I wanted one. I was sad and bored so I said “fuck it”, he gave me one and an hour later I felt nothing. I asked him for more and he let me help myself. I then ate two more. I started to feel the effect immediate and asked Nash to pick me up and take me home before I got sick. Nash agreed and came to get me, now I don’t remember much of that night but what I do I am [REDACTED_NAME] of. I threw up, my cousin gave me a puke bag to leave with. Nash was driving me home and I felt myself becoming sick, Nash had his hand on my lap and I puke into my bag. Which was right over his hand. Next thing I know I’m in my tub, and then somehow in my bedroom. I only remember us talking two times that night. Once in the car when he took a wrong turn and he said “ its okay, I’m not in a rush.” Now I don't remember if I responded to him at that point. The second time we spoke I was in my bedroom puking (NAKED BECAUSE I WAS OVERHEATING AND DUMB) and I remember telling him he didn’t need to stay and watch over me. He asked if I was sure and he left, I don't recall anything more from that night. A week later nothing changed so I asked him if he was avoiding me. He told me “No, I haven't been avoiding you. I have felt a bit off about us lately, though. Been trying to wait till I have words to articulate exactly what's up & That just hasn't happened yet.” I replied with “ Off as in, you just aren't interested any longer? Or Off as in you aren't sure what to do because of the Axel situation”. Now what he replied with shattered my heart as I thought this was something I wouldn't need to feel worried about, because if it was I wouldn’t have risked my own feelings getting hurt. He said “ I’m Talking about you guys having sex. I thought I’d stop thinking about it but I haven’t. Truthfully it's been starting to make me a bit uncomfortable lately. The whole Axel’s reaction thing doesn’t make it any easier but in my own mind it’s becoming harder to deal with”. My mind began to race a million miles a minute. How is this something all of the sudden, when he told me he couldn’t even force himself to feel upset about it? Was he lying this whole time?

Did I ever really know Nash..

Up until this point I thought Nash and I thought the same, I thought I knew him as I know myself because of the way we clicked, which I now feel I was wrong about. I was hurting, all my insecurities peaked through and by the end of the night I was eating Laxatives because I was consumed with the thought of “if I was pretty enough, if I was skinny enough.” Now let me explain something, Nash never said I was fat, he never said anything damaging about myself, that was all my brain. I have borderline personality disorder, when I feel something I feel it so strongly the best way to describe it is like this. Point One, I have a favorite person and their mood and actions make my mood, I idealize my favorite person. Point Two, when I lose a friend because of a fight or especially a significant other, It feels like they died, I grieve for an entire person who is very much alive. So that night I ate 3 Laxatives to “be skinny” and then texted my friend Anais and asked if she would come over because I found out you can indeed overdose from Laxative and I didn’t want to die, I just wanted to look skinny again. I posted about it on my girl's private story which Nash was on because I don't believe in keeping secrets from someone you are in a relationship with. Let me reiterate we weren’t together, we were talking but I treat talking stages and dating the same. It's the same respect regardless. Nash then watched my story and deleted me, I could only assume he thought the worst, which was entirely my fault. All of my friends knew about my laxative problems except him. Once Nash deleted me, I grieved him. I had to, my BPD doesn’t allow it any other way. So for me someone I cared for so deeply was lost, I would never see or speak to him again and I had to find a way to deal with that. I obviously knew he was very much alive, but I grieve for him still.  About two weeks later a gift I ordered for Nash (for Valentines day) came in, I forgot all about it as it shipped late. When I opened the package I saw a custom Neon sign that said “Nash’s Studio” and “2024” as I had it custom made for him. I cried and my friends told me to smash it, but I hold no resentment toward Nash as he did nothing wrong, He was honest. I texted Nash’s friend Dean, I explained how I just wanted Nash to have it. I asked Dean to do me the favor of lying and saying it's from him instead, as I didn’t want Nash to believe it was a way for me to get back into his life. It was simply something I wanted him to keep. Dean agreed as he stated it was “the saddest shit he ever heard”. I dropped it off and from that point forward I decided to not think about Nash. Until… 



Nash reached out to me about a month later… March 13th.

  Now because I thought I’d never hear from him again, when he added me I thought Dean for sure told Nash about the sign. I panicked and texted Dean before Nash even finished typing. I said “hey is there any chance you told Nash about the sign?”. Dead said “no way, why what’s up”. I explained and he said “keep me updated!”, I agreed. Since I had only ever been with Narcissists when Nash started typing a felt a pit in my stomach, I thought “shit what did I do, Did I piss him off?” no. Instead he reached out saying “Was it you I was arguing with about the long exposure thing on iPhones?”, replied with “yea why what happened? Did you figure it out?”. He said “I found this” and sent me a beautiful picture of the sky. Anyone who knows me knows I will stop anywhere to take a picture of the sky, moons, clouds, etc.. I thought “ Wow he was thinking of me?”. He kept conversation that night and the next three days, but I was confused about his intentions and scared of getting my hopes up so I tried to stay talking as if it was a friend. I did ask him for my house key back, I said “hey do you happen to still have my house key?”  He replied with “Yea,I know I didn’t throw it away but I have to find it, Why?”. I thought this response was odd as the only reason a sane person would ask about their house key would be for it back… So I said “ Well I figured I would get more use out of it then you since you don't come over, unless you want to?” he said “oh okay”. I then said “ will you look for it?” he agreed. I texted him about it again a couple of days later, to which he told me he found it. I asked him if i could meet up to get it off him that day but he said he was too busy with work… Which I found odd as I could have picked it up from his house, he could walk it outside, or have a mutual friend bring it to me? I brushed it off though. That following weekend I was off that Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I informed him of my availability, I said to him “ Hey I don’t work tomorrow, Saturday or Sunday if you have time and wanna meet up, you can come to my house or I can drive to you! (For my key ofc!)”



 he said “ ayo sorry I never responded - I gotta let you know though I’m talking to someone & out of respect for her I shouldn’t meet up with you I hope you understand”. 



I said “Okay that’s fine if possible you could drop it off in my mailbox or something?”. No response. A couple days went by and I texted him asking a question for a friend of mine, he left me open. The next time I went to message Nash he had deleted me. There was no after Nash for me, no new talking stage, no boyfriend. Nothing. I know I should have moved on but there just felt like that was possible, I was stuck wondering. I started working out more and spending more time with my friends. I tried to distract myself, as I don’t expect Nash to come back. A part of me doesn’t want him to because I know he deserves better, but a part of me also believes I can be better for him if given the opportunity, Which is kind of pathetic if you ask me. I haven’t heard from Nash since this, but a few weeks ago….. I found out I was pregnant, which I know what you're thinking “how didn’t you know until now, after all this time?”. I never had regular periods, I am [REDACTED_NAME] allowed on certain birth controls because of the adverse effects and I struggle a lot with that part of  me. So for me to have a late period isn't unusual, to have a short period isn't unusual either. I had a two day period in February and I haven’t had a period since. I thought nothing of it until I noticed slight changes in me. It's a bit of too much information but my nipples/ areolas changed in color, I was craving pickles and ice cream. My moods were constantly fluctuating and I almost always felt sick and wanted to cry. I decided to take a pregnancy test on April 24th. It was positive, I called my obgyn and she told me to take one the next day and a week later since she knew I had a lot of health issues. So On April 25th, the 28th and May 4th, I had all positive pregnancy tests. As this was my first pregnancy and the last thing I wanted was my family to know I kept it to just my friends. I tried to reach out to my obgyn to set up an appointment but she never answered and I left a voicemail. I didn’t know what to do or who to contact so I was waiting until my day off to go to the doctors even if it was just a walk in, my time off was for May 15th. I needed to make sure my baby was healthy. That day never came though, I had extremely bad stomach pains, it felt like a piercing needle was going through my stomach all the way to my spine. I started bleeding, at this point I already miscarried the day before at the gym. When I was getting up from the toilet I saw it but I didn't get to inspect what it was before the auto flush…. I was in denial. On May 11th, I went to the hospital. At the hospital I found out I had miscarried, I remember the doctor explaining it all to me and trying to help me through it, I was just thinking while staring off. I recall him saying “this is a lot of information to take in at once, how are you doing you feeling okay?”. Now in my head I am [REDACTED_NAME] through so much and They took a lot of blood from me. I truly couldn’t concentrate and I wanted to cry. I sarcastically chuckled and scoffed “yea”. He repeated his question of “are you okay?” and I said “yes.” He asked if I had any more questions but I couldn't speak, My cousin Jacklyn was with me and started asking him all the important stuff. This whole Time I was trying so hard to figure out how to tell Nash about the baby while he was in a relationship, I was so stressed about it that I feel like I didn't appreciate it. Nash you had every right to know, I wish I could have told you. I wish I found out sooner and got to meet our baby. This now is my biggest regret, because no matter how you would have reacted all I wanted was to meet my baby. Our baby I don't mean to be possessive. I then had to find a way to tell you about it all. Knowing your past relationship traumas I knew you dont believe most things, thankfully I kept a tract of it all. I sent it all to my close friend Anastasia, she wanted to give you more specifics but I told her it wasn't necessary because for some reason I thought you were going to hate me. For not telling you right away, for losing it, I guess I thought you would Hate me for losing our baby. I hated me for the loss of my baby, why shouldn’t you. I was bleeding through an overnight pad every hour for two weeks before it slowed down. I was visibly ill and stressed, I didn’t need more negative reactions from anyone, and I especially couldn’t handle it from you. I was scared, Anastasia said “ he texted back 7 times” she read it to me, I could see your thought process. She read to me “Nash said”... “How long did she know?” “scratch that”, “ I don't need to know”, “Is she Okay?”.... “ as okay as I assuming”, “with everything going on”.  A sense of relief came over me as I realized he didn’t blame me for the loss. Anastasia looked at me as she was reading this to me and said “I’m going to respond and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] lying to him about how you are doing. I’m gonna be honest.”. She knows me all too well, Anastasia knows I don't like to be looked at like a puppy with a broken leg. She's like fire though and she won’t let anyone put that out, not even me. Nor did I want to, I loved her for being so honest to me. I couldn’t ask her to reserve the best part of her. I still to this day don’t know what she said about me though, Its my mystery. I do know Anastasia said Nash said he had no ill feelings towards me, that he respected me for telling him and needed time to process this. Which I obviously completely understood, then he told Anastasia he was deleting her from his snapchat so that his friends and family (and as you would assume girlfriend) won't see it. As he never locked his phone. 

That is the last I heard from Nash, to recap no key was returned. No hatred , no ill feelings. Just genuine care. I hope you processed this and it doesn’t hurt you the way it does me, I know the pain of losing a child is a lot harder for women than men. As we feel physical as well as mental pains, I do hope you care for the child that could have been even if you ever lose care for me. You taught me I am [REDACTED_NAME], That mistakes can be forgiven, and that even if you aren't in my life, to look for a love like you. If you weren’t a lesson before I definitely learned one now. 

  


You deserve to know. I loved you, I still do; You will forever have part of my heart. I cry for you, ache for you, and retouch our memories that slowly fade away as quickly as you breathe. I know I was important to you as you were to me. I will forever hold our memories and take them out on rainy days to remember the feeling of the love you gave me. I still talk to you, without your knowledge of course. We all make choices, good or bad; we tend to forget that our choices affect other people too. I'm [REDACTED_NAME], I thought I was protecting you.

Forgive me. I know we will never be the same, but I will always feel the same. You're like a song I will forever have on replay, always my favorite. My secrets....you deserved to know.

1bpqf9r,1711614288.0,2024-03-28 08:24:48,TrueOffMyChest,Honoring the man who almost ended me,"Avid consumer of Reddit stories, but haven’t done too many posts before so here we go, Redditors. This is going to be a long one.
This is a true story about fate and I hope it can enrich your lives as it has mine. 

When I was 16 y/o, my parents and I were involved in a bad accident. It was the day after Christmas and I wanted to go hang out at my friend’s house after spending the last several days with my family for the holidays. My parents weren’t too eager to go back out into the slushy mess rapidly accumulating on the roads, but I pestered them and finally persuaded them into letting me stay the night over at my friend’s place. 
I was so excited to get there; plans to stay up late playing video games and not having to worry about school the next day… you know… classic 16 y/o mentality. I was so darn excited that I didn’t even bother putting on my jacket before running out the door and getting into the car (this detail will be important in a moment). 

My parents decided they’d take me and grab the local newspaper from the convenience store while they’re out to further justify the decision. I was just pleased to’ve gotten my way. We hit the road and I was buckled in the back seat, passenger side (R rear seat) behind my mom. My dad was driving and we were hardly on the road for a minute before my mom turns around and tells me in classic “mom fashion” to put on my jacket. I unbuckle my seatbelt and reach down towards the floor of the back seat behind my dad, when I hear my mom shout my dad’s name. I look up to see a pair of headlights directly in front of us; yards… no… feet away, and coming at us quick! Crash. 

It all went dark. This was the only time in my life I’ve ever been KOed. I came to looking at the ceiling of the car. I’m lying between my parents. The deployed airbags to both sides of my head. My back achy as I peel myself off the decimated center console between the front seats. We were all alive, but we weren’t safe and we weren’t alright by any means.
This was the first time I’ve ever been hit so hard… undoubtably concussed. I ask my parents if they’re okay. 
My mom had suffered some pretty bad whiplash (and had more medical issues later that most likely resulted from this accident), but otherwise, my mom was the same, sharp witted and even sharper tongued hardass she’s always been. Just rattled. 
My dad wasn’t doing well. The car had been smashed in pretty badly on his side and his L leg was trapped inside the crushed front of the car. Piecing together the events that’d just unfolded while calling emergency services, my dad had swerved in the attempt to avoid a direct collision and was consequently trapped within the vehicle. He’s always been my best friend and my hero, but he’s the bravest and kindest person I’ve ever met in my life. Replaying the scene in my head… I should’ve been ejected from the car. We were going around 45mph and I assume the other car was going about the same. I have no doubt that my dad’s evasive maneuvers are what saved my family that night. 

After being struck head on, we were struck on the side of our car and pushed up the road 30 yards or so. Witnesses behind our car, including the second car that’s struck us said that our vehicle was launched into the air slightly before being hit again and pushed down the road instead of into the nearby ditch. We somehow all survived. 
The emergency responders wanted to Mercy flight my dad to the nearest intensive care hospital after cut him out of the car. My mom and I were injured but not even close to the degree my dad was, so we took a very brief ambulance ride to our nearby hospital. Remember the slushy weather? Yeahhh... My dad had to get driven to that hospital an hour away because the conditions weren't great for flying. Tough as nails, that guy. 

I remember this night so vividly. I remember the sound of me resetting my nose after I came to and the intense odor of airbag dust and my own blood. I remember my dad's scream as it still brings me to tears nearly an entire lifetime later. I remember the faces of the first responders who're there and helping my family get the medical attention we needed following the accident. A few of them were classmates of mine (shout out to you, Nick and Steph; thank you so much again and wishing you guys the happiest of lives full of meaning and purpose). I remember the paramedics that brought us to the hospital and how my mom told me to be quiet after the sixth time I thanked them for their assistance with this whole situation and accident.

Now for the other drivers...
The second car to strike us had a few people in it that immediately sprung to action. The driver almost made a crucial error when he approached our car and admitted to my dad (who is in agony and actively being skewered) that he's the one who struck us. My dad in almost swung at him when he admitted to that before realizing that he was too put together to've been the driver of the car who stuck us head on. Thank you to those in the second car and for your assistance in trying to clear up any confusion following the events of that evening. l
Finally... The gentleman who was driving the car, driving on the wrong side of the median and going east on the westbound lane. That gentleman was a father of two young children who he left behind that night when he decided to drive home after spending a little too much time at the bar. His BAC was over 3 times the legal limit, so color me impressed that he even managed to find his keys, his car, get the car started and keeping it between the lines... Just unfortunately going the wrong way. He made a mistake that night and he paid the ultimate price with his life. 

Since then, my family has gotten stronger and closer, although it took some time and maturing from multiple parties. My guilt is still something I deal with to this day. I felt responsible for why my parents had suffered and were even in that situation that night. If I hadn't pestered them then we wouldn't've ever been on the road that evening. I felt unworthy of life for some time. I wasn't looking at my glass as half full at all. I had a lot of issues before the accident, and a sure as hell had a lot more afterwards. I suffered from chronic pain, which didn't help my mental health, making me more miserable. How could I even begin to see my glass as anything but half empty? I convinced myself I was a victim and I wasn't going to be anything other than that. It was my identity. I would introduce myself to people and then cringily tell them about my heavy baggage and how I live with chronic pain following my accident. 16 y/o had a lot of annoying tendencies (shoot, present me has a lot of annoying tendencies). Present me wishes I could've given past me some tough love or some words of encouragement, but they probably would've been wasted on me. 

I was lost but was college bound but had no idea what I wanted to do... so I settled on a hobby/skill I was gifted at; Art and Design. This is the part of the story where I find my passion for art and how I become the greatest modern day artist known globally, right? No. I immediately realized that I hated having to do designs for work. It wasn't fun for me and I was lacking purpose and meaning. 
It wasn't too far into my freshman year when I met a Dr. who was a guest lecturer at my college. His message was captivating and his energy was palpable. Here's this guy who is making a difference in people's lives and helping them pursue healthier lifestyles. He and his wife run this wellness clinic and I started taking control of my health and committed myself to getting better. For the first time in a long time, I didn't hurt constantly. I didn't have constant headaches. I no longer needed to cycle between Advil and Tums to try and manage my pain levels but also the ulcers I was forming due to the obscene amounts of Ibuprofen I was taking. My Dr.s would eventually become my mentors when I decided to switch my major and start pursuing a career in healthcare. 

Graduate school is no joke. Something I learned is that this story I'm [REDACTED_NAME] here isn't original. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the only person who's life got turned upside down by a car accident. I felt as though a third of my class had similar stories to why they're pursuing a career in healthcare. It was quite the wake-up call when you've always seen yourself as a Bruce Wayne or Harry Potter type character; a protagonist created from tragedy. There were a lot of Batmans in my grad school. 

While I was at grad school, I was in a class called General Diagnosis. This class is a fairly sizable class where you learn all about pathologies and different clinical diagnoses that you could encounter varying from trauma to the most obscure of tapeworms. It was a really cool class and we had this really fun professor. She had attitude, but it was that cool kind of attitude. Calling it sassy would be an insult to her... Regardless, she's a genuinely wonderful professor and amazing human-being. I know this because fate works in amazing ways. It was the weekend before Canadian Thanksgiving (a decent number or students at my school were Canadian, so a lot of them were traveling and absent from class this day). Our Professor, we'll call her Dr. FJ, was telling a story about alcoholism and how she'd been witness to a lot of accidents during her time as a EMT... 
I imagine a lot of readers are starting to figure it out. Dr. FJ was one of the EMTs who rode with my mom and I to the hospital 6 years earlier. 
As she's telling the story, recalling one of the worst accidents she'd ever seen and describing it in vivid details, every hair on my body stood up as I started realizing that she's telling my story. The punchline to her story is that there was a young kid who survived the accident in the back seat of the car that was struck. I was biting my tongue up until this point. I knew I had to tell her and come clean. I was the kid in the back seat of that car. 
""December 26th. I was that kid.""
Here stood before me one of my favorite teachers who coincidentally helped save my family that night. She came up to me on our mid class break (2 hour long courses), and we caught up and discussed my parents. My parents eventually got the opportunity to meet Dr. FJ at my White Coat Ceremony and my Graduation. It was surreal and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it was a little awkward in all reality, but it was truly one of my fondest memories from those years. This interaction just further assured me that I was on the right path and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to be able to help others like I was helped those many years prior. 

Fast-forward to today - I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a practicing Dr. and have my own wellness clinic now. Inside my office I have a painting I did when we first had our accident. It's nothing special but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] biased. I think it's a beautiful amateur painting that really helped me understand not just myself but the man who nearly took everything from me that slushy night. The painting is of an angel with one golden, angelic wing, and one dark and bat/dragon-like wing. Behind the angel is a Taoist yin-yang symbol with the central dots being eyes that look back at the viewer. It serves as a mirror and a reminder that everyone is capable of great good and great evil. Just because someone did something evil (whether subjectively or objectively), doesn't mean that they're unredeemable. 

The man who struck us that night did something irresponsible and wrong. He left behind two kids who're now likely full grown and/or entering adulthood. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a father yet, but I hope to be someday, but I know it'd tear me apart if I couldn't see my kids grow old and get the chance to celebrate life with them. To say he really screwed up with his decision-making that night would be an understatement, however, I pity the man and have a small... ever so slight... appreciation and compassion for him. He, unknowingly, propelled me down this path that's lead me to find purpose and to be extremely happy, healthy, as well as a much more mature and patient person. I have healthier relationships now, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] so many people cope and overcome their obstacles in life. Thank you, sir, for you helped me grow and I hope your spirit can rest well knowing that I will do my best and continue to try and enrich the lives of those I interact with. I will live my life for the both of us. 

Thank you, Redditors, for staying with me this long and I hope y'all got something from this too.",12

I still had mine on, and I definitely felt like the odd man out, but when I turned down an aisle, I saw a mom and her son (probably about 10 years old) wearing their masks. I could tell the kid felt uncomfortable wearing his, but when he saw me (I’m 27, have some tattoos, weird hair, etc) wearing mine, I think it made him feel better! Any time I saw them around the store after that, he had some pep in his step and was striding around helping his mom get groceries. 

Not a big “off my chest”, but I almost felt like I was the weird one wearing the mask today, and it just made me feel better having a little solidarity with someone that was just as uncomfortable as I was.

Edit: Thanks for all the kind words and awards! And I hope some of you don’t feel too oppressed by people being safe around you.",20177
1lfqw7h,1750380439.0,2025-06-20 00:47:19,TrueOffMyChest,I did not realize that rehoming a dog was so horrible,"I didn't realize rehoming a dog was so horrible

My parents bought a dog years ago that they didn't want after a week. They typically get a dog, its too much effort, then they let it go somewhere or give it someone and rinse and repeat. I get that that is messed up.

However, I made the mistake of making a post talking about how I want to rehome the dog because I work 2-3 jobs and I am [REDACTED_NAME] school. I'm 21. Did not buy the dog. But I kept it around because I didn't want to her to be just thrown away and I take care of her. But now I've grown up and I am [REDACTED_NAME] 12 anymore with unlimited free time and patience. Its already a struggle just to find time to take care of myself and my mental health issues are getting really bad with the stress of everything. 

I wanted to find a family who has time and resources to spoil and love the dog. Yes I still love the dog so I wrote in the post I would like to visit her occasionally and would like frequent pictures. I thought it was the okay mature thing to do to admit that I have too much on my plate. She is also getting older and someone with better resources can help her in old age life.

My parents are not at all interested in taking care of her. I have never rehomed a dog before. This is my first time inquiring about it. I wouldn't buy and adopt a dog and then throw it away instantly.

They tore me apart. Accused me of not loving her, being a terrible horrible person, morally wrong, made assumptions about me and my life. One person said I should hire someone (with my broke self in debt) to live in the home (parents home) to take care of her? Umm. They think I should see it through and keep her forever, and put the dog before myself. 

I had no idea rehoming to a stable and loving environment was so horrible. I think another trigger word was the word free, but I didn't realize the normal process should be to charge because its my first time. I didn't think about charging for her. People pointed out her potentially being used as bait or food which is valid and I would obviously meet the people and do a background check. 

Now I feel like a garbage person 

Edit: I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and didn't realize it was entitled to want pictures or to visit. I am [REDACTED_NAME] the choice to rehome and I might continue to keep her, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] completely sure at the moment and need time.

Edit 2: I don't have any children, and it became being about having children and how I shouldn't have kids as well. I don't have any and I am [REDACTED_NAME] planning on that any time soon. It’s all my fault even though I didn't adopt it so I think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to keep the dog then. I don't want to be bad or feel guilty. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to have to keep trying harder. I understand that it is my fault. I am [REDACTED_NAME]. Thanks for the comments.",755

My stepdad physically abused me when I was 16. I called the cops and my mom literally abandoned me after that. I went through so many years alone struggling to even buy food. I feel so much emotions. Makes me feel relieved she’s about to cry every day and suffer exactly Like i Did. 

I feel sorry for her as well, as I know she really loved him. 

She will never know I feel sorry though! She will never get my sympathy, i have no intentions of connecting with her again. 
So now she has to really sit and live with what she did. Shits crazy


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kind words I appreciate it so much. I really don’t have anyone to talk to about this and it’s making me go nuts.

EDIT 2: I wanted to add something more freaky.  Well for the last year or so before he died, I was having nightmares of ME being MURDERED.

We grew up in a really small neighborhood next to a religious school and college so everyone knew each other but we made sure we kept all of our friendship a secret.
When I went to college (away from home) I stopped talking to everyone including him so we just started talking again this year after I saw him on the park and asked him to walk me home, after hanging out every day for 4 months we got together.
Yesterday we were talking about how dumb we were for taking so long to realise we liked each other and he admitted that he liked me for many years but couldn't say anything because he was ashamed of it and the things we did while I was underage.
He has apologized for the way he treated me when I was younger, he was a bit of a bully, even though I had completely forgotten about it. 
Recently, we've been frequenting friends and acquaintances from my highschool years and he has said things that remind me of the way he used to treat me and I feel so small and unwanted all over again, I don't know how to move past it, it's not who he is now, the way we are is way different than before, but now I see pictures or friends remind us of things we did back then and all the memories come back and it's kind of painful having to pretend everything was different back then.",5105

Hi friends, gay M(32) reflecting on a very toxic and emotionally heavy relationship that I've worked (and am working) hard to move on from. I wanted to process an old relationship in a public forum--not for advice, but for my own reflection and perspectives that aren't my own. I'm [REDACTED_NAME], this is a HUGE post.

This is a long story that needs good background, and I don't perceive it as being polarized; I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to do my best to present how I messed up and how they messed up. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to be splitting it into sections for reading comfort, and numbering the referenced exes:

# Important background information on me:

For the first 18 years of my life I lived with sexually abusive parents in a reclusive island and in a remote home in the woods that had no gay culture to speak of. My early friendships and relationships were generally online with adults who would ask for pictures of me, demand my time, have me write smut for them, etc. In fact, the only way I left this was by hopping into a relationship with a stranger online, with whom I'd actually entered a similar long-term relationship. Upon moving there, I found that he'd been talking online with another woman while we were in a monogamous relationship. ***This is not the relationship I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about.*** We broke up 6 years later in 2014. However, Ex #1 will become important later. (Note, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] using #s for the exes because the timeline is convoluted, and not ranking or disrespect meant to them as people.)



So it should be pretty obvious at this point that I didn't get out of all that unscathed. In the years following I'd been diagnosed with PTSD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder which had become so bad that I couldn't go to public places alone, I cannot drive, and am essentially motivated by fear and anger. As such, I've lost plenty of friends and burnt many bridges because while I could hold my mental health intact for months at a time, something would inevitably provoke me--and like emotional constipation, I'd eventually shit out my anger in some stupid way. This never manifested in physical anger, and *rarely* yelling. I've been told I can be pleasant and friendly and fun, but there's no doubt that I've done gone and fucked it up when I felt hurt.

Over the years I've attempted to enter into therapy with mixed and sometimes deeply uncomfortable results. Medication routines hadn't been well set, and because my attention was already so messy I wasn't consistent with keeping up with mental health issues. These were the shaky foundations on which I shouldn't have entered into another long-term relationship.

# The Beginning: 2016

I did not move out with Ex #1, and in fact we moved into (and were living) in the same room together. At this point, I couldn't afford to live alone and so I roomed with him and my best friend at the time; but we didn't have sex and I actually managed to live my own life for the most part. My mental health wasn't great but I was doing my best with what I had; I'd gotten into graduate school for Clinical Psychology and was very excited about my future. Hell, I even found a new boyfriend who knew and was okay with the situation I was in with #1. Unfortunately, that new boyfriend ended up getting intimate with his ex, and we broke up in 2016 after only 6 months of dating. (I can't believe I *just* realized these three relationships are '666'.)

After ex #2 broke up with me, my confidence was pretty shattered. Ex #1 and my best friend who I was living with were growing really distant from me, and my mental health was turning me back into a resentful, paranoid, and fearful person who was bottling up all my lovely little emotions. That's when I met Ex #3, only a *month* after I'd broken up with #2.

=

Ex #3, who takes the center of this story, seemed so perfect when I met him. We were both extremely nerdy, and he took great notice of anything I did--when I pulled out a chair, his gratitude was radiant. He'd say nice things about how I looked, and while he was certainly the more passive of the two of us, it was all that little validation that I'd been craving. #3 hooked me. But I also told him I didn't want him to be a rebound; I didn't want to enter into a relationship with him at first, and only keep it in the dating phase; he was okay, but visibly a little disappointed about it. He knew about #1 and was just fine with it.

Just as we'd begun this new relationship, I started a new medication routine, which made me lose my sense of propriety. This came to a head when I gave #3 head in my workplace's office after-hours, where I'd gotten caught on security cameras. I was promptly fired; my fault, no question. Shaken, I decided to go home to visit family for the summer to try and collect myself for a bit. #3 was supportive and even cooked me cupcakes to send me off in a loving manner.

=

During that trip, one of my sisters (the only one I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to) and I got quite drunk, and she opened up to me: Our father had sexually abused her. I had no idea, because I thought I'd been the only one who was sexually abused, and I didn't think I was worth the effort of telling people. But when I learned this about my sister, we made the choice to tell our mother about what had occurred.

=

So, when I returned from family I was a complete wreck. The night I returned, I slept with Ex #1 for the first time in 2 years. Here's a bullet list of what happened next:

* The next day I broke down to my best friend during a brunch and told them what I'd done, sobbing--there was a very odd silence and I chose to leave
* I told #3 two days after I'd done it, and repeatedly apologized; he was upset and cried on the phone
* Became increasingly despondent during my classes and had to leave my clinical psych program, only a semester away from graduating
* Entered into an official relationship with #3 after some space with the #1 incident (yes, we still lived in the same room)
* We chose to move in together after *only 4 months total* of dating.

Come to find, #3 underestimated his finances by about $5,000 a month. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not sure how that happened, but it left me scrambling to find work and us unable to stay in the property. I decided I had to move back home with family across the country. He said he wanted to come with me, and I was hesitant. Still, we eventually decided ""f\*ck it, we're in love"" and went to move in with my family.

# The ""F*ck it, we're in love"" Years: 2017 - 2018

We moved in initially with the sister mentioned above. I was very lethargic to this point, to the point of anhedonia. I wasn't cleaning their mom-in-law suite to the degree I should have been and spilled red wine on the carpet, which I'd put soda water on and tried to soak up, but to no avail. My sister was getting so upset, I asked her if we needed to leave and she said ""yes"", so we took up the offer to move into a very tiny apartment where my mother was.

My mom is not a sane person--the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. She would make frequent micro-aggressive comments toward #3 (African-American) which #3 and I agreed were really off-color. She told me I needed to get back into therapy, and so decided to hire a personal trainer to get my body back into shape under the guise of mental health, when she was actually ashamed of how much weight I'd gained in the last half year.

#3 and I didn't find jobs, and my mental health was getting worse; to the point where #3 burst into the bathroom to jumpscare me as a joke, and I snapped at him in response. Additionally, when he came to hug me, I pushed him off in mid-episode. I was getting very distant, using video games and my computer to disassociate. Additionally, my mother was asking #3 to get things down the street repeatedly, to the point where #3 was saying he felt he was being treated ""like a slave"" by myself and my mother. I don't remember my actions coming to this kind of level, but I immediately did my best to take responsibility and respond to his needs in the way #3 needed.

=

After 9 months of struggling, #3 and I *finally* moved into our own studio apt, and we had our own jobs. But a lot of the damage was done. We weren't really having sex, which I was okay with; we didn't have much sex to begin with. I was craving validation, and so I repeated what I'd done after I found out #1 had been cheating: I asked #3 if he wanted to open the relationship. He initially said ""no"" and I was fine with it.

One week later, he tells me he's been sexting his coworker and flirting with him, and so asked if we could open it back up. I said yes, and we set some basic ground rules (STD testing, communicating about partners, etc), and he slept with his coworker the next day. When I asked how it was, he told me about this partner's attractiveness and that's when that awful sting of jealousy and envy began to grow in my gut. Topping it off, my isolationism had grown to the point where I didn't have a therapist, and he and I had gained a friend group who self-medicated with weed and alcohol.

=

It's important I take responsibility for how bad I'd gotten at this point:

Firstly, I had been writing erotica with Ex #1 (with #3's permission) while I was gaming and zoning out. I felt like it was fair, and additionally, I felt like I owed it to #3 because of all the drama, all the tumultuousness we'd been through. I was see-sawing between ""this son of a bitch"" and ""what the fuck am I doing, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] him miserable"". When I got extremely stressed, I would start physically beating myself and screaming; not at #3, but I would get rageful if I lost at a video game or got furious doing dishes.

#3 told me he was doing the majority of the chores at this point. I believed him. I didn't even remember how much I was or was not doing because my brain was so foggy between shitty health and drugs to drown it out. Attempts to quit would be quickly drowned out by a ""fuck-it"" mode that would happen because #3 and our friend group were such heavy users.

The open relationship was distinctly one-sided; we had an occasional 3-way, but the majority of the time #3 was meeting the majority of men. This really nailed down my jealousy and envy; not just that he wasn't giving attention to me, but that he was getting it so easily and effortlessly, and loving it. This is where my see-sawing got very bad. When I was sober, I would say that I couldn't keep the open relationship open, and we'd agree to close it--but #3 would get very emotionally put-out. So, the moment I wasn't sober I would essentially say that it was okay and that I needed to work harder on getting over my hurt.

#3 got his hookups through Grindr. It got to the point that hearing the Grindr sounds began to trigger me, and I began to spy on his phone. I would repeatedly tell him when I did, and asked him to set up passwords so that I couldn't access his information; but then I would see-saw back into wanting to look at the home notifications. It was getting bad.

# And Then it Got Worse: 2019

I couldn't hold down a job. I was beginning to get my rage and self-harms somewhat more under control, but I was having panic attacks and sobbing whenever my partner would go and sleep with others. He'd told me that at one point, while we were high, that I'd said ""you don't have to tell me who you sleep with"". At one point, in the span of a month, he'd slept with 4 men in public areas and revealed that he hadn't told me about any of them or gotten STD testing. I was furious and hurt and got tested myself out of fear, but it didn't matter because (when I counted) we'd had sex somewhere around 3 times that entire year.

=

This came to a head when #3 told me that ""S"" had told him 'I love you' during one of their sessions. #3 and S had been sleeping together for nearly 2 years at this point in our relationship, and I was particularly sensitive about S because #3 had made very positive comments about his body and personality. I think S was an oasis away from our small apartment and my shitty mental health, which is understandable, but my see-sawing insecurity kept #3 on-edge and pushed him towards this hookup.

We broke up, while still living together. The night we broke up, #3 invited S over to have sex in our apartment. I went to the roof of our place (because at this point public places still terrified me) and stayed in the greenhouse up there. It was February and cold, and so he texted me that I could come down 2 hours later. S was still there on the couch, and #3 wanted to watch movies like nothing had happened. The air was tense, and S could definitely sense it.

Two weeks passed and I was paranoid. I couldn't stop hearing Grindr notifications, and I was absolutely in a wreck about whether #3 and S were actually going to become a couple. #3 was seeing people constantly, and telling me I needed to get out of the apartment more.

=

Things came to a head when #3 had a date with S in our apartment building's rec room. He asked me to hook up the video games for him and S, and I said ""no"". I was standing between him and the exit of the room, and #3 walked toward me and pushed me out of the way, making me hit the wall and drop to my knees. At this point I couldn't fight back--not just against him and S, but what I wasn't able to provide. I reached out to our friend group to help, but those I opened to either didn't respond or made subsequent hang-out plans with #3.

After another two weeks, #3 told me S had clarified that he *hadn't* actually said 'I love you' and that #3 had misheard him.

I tried to get out, and for 3 days I did. My mother picked me up, and on the ride to her home she realized that this might be longer-term. So she took a detour to drop me off at my other sister's house (not the one from earlier in the story). After three days there, #3 texted that he missed me and that I should come home. This was the validation my crappy brain was clawing at the bit for, and so I moved back in.

=

One of the first things #3 said when I moved back in was: ""I got used to you being away"". I didn't really know how to react. I was numb at this point.

# Pandemic Years: 2020 - 2021

January of 2020 was particularly strange. I'd mentioned above that I reached out to mutual friends of mine and #3. Only two of them responded:

One of whom had been saying rather nasty things to #3 about me during their cocktail hangouts. I confronted her via text, and she threatened to track me down and beat me. There was no reaction from #3 so I defended myself by saying I would rise to her challenge; she did not respond and that friendship was over.

The other friend messaged me at the end of January on FB (2 months after I'd messaged) to ask if I ""needed a place to stay"" because she needed a catsitter for a few days while she and her boyfriend were out of town. I essentially messaged back to say I didn't appreciate her reaching out when it was convenient, and that friendship was also over.

=

#3 and I decided to get back together after a couple lukewarm-nice evenings of smoking up and drinking. I felt trapped. Then the Pandy hit, and we were quarantined together. #3 was growing increasingly frustrated that I was around the apartment all the time. 2020 was a very silent year; he still went and slept with people, I still cried myself to sleep and had panic attacks at phone notifications, and was just becoming more of a wreck to be trapped in a room with.

There's not much more to say about the year. We only had sex with one another 4 times that year (an improvement!), and we were generally so stoned that it's hard to even remember. I was a wreck and couldn't find any work, and #3 was hooking up in Grindr guys' cars.

In 2021 our fights were escalating. When I was going through an episode and I said I wanted to unalive myself, #3 quipped: ""Well, why don't you?"" while glaring at me. At this point I had a Google Doc labeled ""Anti-Gaslighting"" because I was doubting my own memory between himself, my lack of a friend group, and my strange family.

Finally, during one very bad fight, he snapped a pencil in half and jabbed himself in the cheek with it. I don't know why this was the straw that broke me, but it was. I left for the first sister's house after I called her to tell her the situation.

# Leaving: 2021 - Present

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] ending my 2nd year of law school in a city across the country. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a medication routine that's been working well for (specifically) my PTSD symptoms. I've been no-contact with my mother and from #3 for three years now. My mental health is far from perfect, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] cloying for validation--but I have a friend group who hears me and understands me. I haven't self-harmed or had a rage-out in three years either.

It's not perfect now. I just left a landlord (who was also my roommate) situation last Nov where they ended up stealing money, grabbing my arm, and shoving me against a wall. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a new apartment that's falling to pieces.

But I'm [REDACTED_NAME] like hell to move on. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] like hell to become a lawyer to be there for people the way I think they need. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] perfect, I never will be, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] happy to at least have a sliver of independence and feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my way to personal freedom.

I did CPR for around 15-20 minutes and when the paramedics arrived, one of them told me she choked on her vomit and it was my fault.","My grandma was 83 and had many medical conditions but had seen a geriatrician a couple of days before. I was 24 and had received first aid training a couple of years ago in my University.
There was my grandma, my mom, my aunt, (her daughters) my sister, my uncle and 2 cousins in High School.

She said she wasn't feeling well and went to lie down. My aunt went to check on her like 3-5 minutes later and started screaming. We all ran to the bedroom and she wasn't breathing. My grandma was like 1.75 (5.7 feet) and very overweight, I was 1.65 and 54 kilos. I couldn't move her from her bed to the floor. Her bed was very hard. So I put her as straight as I could, remove pillows, started CPR and scream to call an ambulance.

I told my cousins to go outside and wave at the ambulance (it's not an easy place to find). My mom and aunt stayed with me and everyone else was out of the room.

I did CPR for 15-20 minutes and what they don't tell you is that it is EXHAUSTING. I felt she came back for a minute, kept going and I felt when she was gone. I don't know how to explain this.

Near the end I felt a sour air/taste and I knew something was wrong and I stopped. I was sobbing, my aunt had been watching and she kept going. Like 3 minutes later the paramedics arrived.

They put her on the ground but stopped CPR a little later. One of them asked why I didn't put her on the floor and that I caused a bronchial aspiration (english is not my first language so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure about this word). She said it right in front of my mom and aunt. I just left the room and went outside to weep. I loved my grandma and to this day I don't know if I killed her.

Specially, physicians, nurses, Emts, first reponders, paramedics and whoever I'm [REDACTED_NAME] out by mistake. This huge weight in my heart is gone and I can breath better.

I wanted to point out all my love to paramedics (and such you have so many acronyms I'm [REDACTED_NAME] familiar with). I have always know you're the best and I just got the bad apple.

17hcgw5,1698370882.0,2023-10-27 01:41:22,TrueOffMyChest,I just realized my wife doesn’t love me,"Today I came to the realization that my wife doesn’t love me. She said she does but her actions over the years, show that she doesn’t. She loves the life that I have given her but not necessarily me. My wife is a lovely person, whom I adore and treat like a queen. She had been working up until about 3 years ago when she was diagnosed with a disease. She would at times help with household chores when we first were married but doesn’t help with any daily housekeeping. She doesn’t clean, vacuum, wash clothes, do yard work, she pretty much just does the dishes and that’s it. She doesn’t make much money now that she is on disability. She contributes little monetarily. The amount she contributes basically covers her cellphone bill and cable TV bill. I pay everything else each month. She does treatments every night but goes to bed around 2:00am and wakes up anywhere between noon and 1 pm.

There were many times where she wouldn’t do anything for my birthday or Father’s Day. I am [REDACTED_NAME] and shower her with nice gifts for special occasions and gifts just because I love her. I mean I’m talking Louis Vuitton purses, bags, diamonds and nice shoes.

Sex is none existent and I’ve always had to initiate it. She would almost always have an orgasm and if I shot it too quickly, she would get bitter and I better recover quickly. She said she doesn’t have sex drive but to be honest she doesn’t have drive for anything that requires effort. 

A lot of those things I could probably overlook. 

The thing that really has been in the back of my mind is something that happened last year. Last August I had a heart attack.  I was feeling bad when I went to bed and woke up at 4am with really bad chest pain. I went down stairs to find the blood pressure cup to see what was going on. It’s was really high. I started sweating, had a hard time breathing and sick to my stomach. I sat down for a few minutes. I looked up signs of a heart attack and I had them all. I drank some water and felt a tiny bit better. I decided to drive to the hospital. I know it was stupid but it’s a fairly straight shot and it was early in the morning. I got to the hospital and they fast tracked me through and started running tests. 

My wife woke up at 11 and noticed I wasn’t home and tracked me on the find my iPhone app. She texted me and I told her I was in the ER and they thought I had a heart attack and I had all the markers. I was taking nitro and they gave me bunch of other things, which helped She came up to pick up the car and dropped off a couple of things. She then left and went to dinner with her friend. The next day I’m still in the hospital and I was hurt she went to dinner when I’m in the ER. I told her not to come up and well she didn’t. She only came up to pick me up to go home. She’s been in the hospital about 6 or 7 times. I would visit her every day when she was in the hospital. I would bring her flower and treats. I would wait in the ER every time to keep her company. I only missed 1 day and that was because she was supposed to be released and I was waiting till she was sprung. 

This has been sitting on me for the last year, it’s not getting better. We had a fight that I instigated today. I told her how hurt I was and she said my feelings always get hurt. I asked her if her mother, sister or grandfather was in the ER with a heart attack would she go back home to be with them and she said yes. After that answer, I knew she isn’t in love with me, just loves what I give her. She doesn’t understand that she isn’t giving any back in return. She is like a roommate at this point. A roommate that doesn’t pay rent or help take care of the house or do much of anything to make my life better.",2776

No-one knows that I did it on purpose.","I already know that everyone on this subreddit is judging me hardcore but please read this entire post before commenting (lol).  
I am [REDACTED_NAME] to give some context for my non-Australian friends out there. In Australia, in grade 3, 5, 7 and 9, all students are required to complete something called NAPLAN testing. NAPLAN testing consists of group of standardised tests that is similar to the SATs in the US, and are done over roughly 2-4 days. The results of NAPLAN testing is sent to the Bureau of Statistics, and are then used to alter education curriculums and identify what areas in reading, writing, spelling and numeracy that the kids in that year group are struggling with. These are tests that you CANNOT study for or cheat on in any way, and the material on the tests are kept top secret until the day of the test (this piece of information is important for this story, don't worry).

I did my first test, like many others, in grade 3. I was 7 years old at the time. During this exam, however, instead of having our regular teacher supervising us, we had a lady from the government office looking over us. This woman was SCARY. She was like that one gym coach that took everything way too seriously and was overly strict with rules. One of the weird rules that this lady put in place was that during the test (roughly two hours long), we were not permitted to leave the room at any time. This included getting a drink of water, stretching your legs, and going to the bathroom. To make sure of this, she locked the front door with a key. Looking back, this is an insane thing to ask of a classroom of 7 and 8 year old kids who have no control of when they need to go to the bathroom.

The test began as usual, and around 20 minutes in, I felt the need to use the bathroom. However, I was a very shy kid who never asked adults anything, and always kept to myself, so due to my fear of this lady and my fear of confrontation, I held it.

Around 10 minutes go by, and I decide to ask if I can use the bathroom. I raise my hand, the lady comes over to my desk, I ask to go to the bathroom, and she refuses. I simply say 'okay, miss' and continue to hold it.

Another 5 minutes go by, and I raise my hand again to use the bathroom, as I was getting desperate and couldn't focus on my test. She came over and refuses. I said 'okay, miss', and try to get by while holding it. This went on another two times.

At this point, it was roughly 45 minutes into the two hour test, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] struggling to hold it. I am [REDACTED_NAME], I am [REDACTED_NAME], and could not focus at all on the material in front of me. I decide to ask this lady for a fifth time to use the bathroom. She STILL didn't get the hint that I genuinely needed to go. When I raised my hand for the fifth time, she glared at me and stormed over to my desk. She tells me that she 'knows that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to leave so I can cheat on the test' and that she 'doesn't like naughty little fakers like me'. My blood was beginning to boil at this point, as I had followed the rules the whole time, there was no way for a 7 year old to cheat on a test where no-one had the answers and that it was very obvious that I genuinely needed to use the bathroom. This lady looked at me dead in the eyes and scolded at me to sit down and be quiet. I simply said, 'okay, miss'. And stayed silent. She walked back up to the front of the classroom and sat back at her desk to supervise. At this point all of the other kids in my class knew that I was essentially being picked on by this teacher, and began to visibly feel bad for me. My frequent hand-raising was distracted them, as well, as it isn't often that a kid raises their hand that much during a test.

I knew that there was no way for me to complete this test while badly needing the bathroom. Everyone knows the feeling of needing the bathroom so bad that it's all they can think about. I was raging at this, as I had lost my focus and that this lady was being mean to me for absolutely no reason at all. So I decided to have a bit of fun.

I raised my hand for the sixth time. I waited for this lady to notice my raised hand. When she did, she looked INFURIATED and simply HORRIFYING. She had had enough of my 'shenanigans' and actually lost her temper. 

""WHAT?! What is it now?""

I locked eyes with this woman and stared at her. Everyone else in the classroom snapped their heads up, as their focus was now broken by her yelling. I stared. And then I let it loose.

I peed. On purpose. All over the chair. In a silent classroom. All while making direct eye contact with the woman who refused to let me go.

Because I was so mad, and now immediately regretting my decision, I began to cry of embarrassment. I was so pissed off at this lady that I physically couldn't hold my bladder and RAGE PEED IN THE CLASSROOM to prove a point.

It took this lady about two seconds to realise what was happening, and her anger turned to shock. Wow, a grown woman \*shocked\* that refusing a 7 year old to use the bathroom would result in them being unable to hold it. 

She ran over to me, while I was still crying of embarrassment, covered in pee, grabbed me by the wrist, and rushed me out of the classroom and to the school office. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sobbing while I was given a change of clothes and got permission to skip the rest of the test. 

When I got back to class, everyone asked me if I was okay, since they heard me crying during the test, and how I accidentally wet myself during the test. I went along with the accusation and told them that it was an accident.

It wasn't. I was a petty little girl, with no social confidence, who raged peed during a test at the age of 7. 

The reason that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this now is because NAPLAN testing has commenced for the year in Australia as of this week, and talking about it as an adult now reminded me of this incident, and how I never told anyone that it was on purpose.

Feel free to judge me now. I needed to get this off my chest (hence why I posted this on this subreddit), and I can think of this story when I need to channel some petty energy and confidence to do daring shit.

Before I have to begin, I have to say that unfortunately, English is not my first language, but I will do the effort to write good so all of you can still understand. I wrote that in English because I hope that using another language than my mother tongue will be easier for me, as if I am [REDACTED_NAME] a barrier...

It's the first time I write my ""story"". Each time I tried - because one of my hobbies is to write and draw - I never suceeded. I would always rip the paper, write something else, etc. But my situation is tormenting me, and I think it is time to write. I think I need other people to see it, so they can see that they are not alone, so I can see that I am [REDACTED_NAME] crazy. This post will be very long, as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] away all that I kept in myself... I cannot speak to anyone else. I cannot speak alone no more.

&#x200B;

\------------

&#x200B;

I am [REDACTED_NAME] 19 years old.

It happened to me from my 6 years to my 13 years old.

&#x200B;

When I was young, my family had a **friend**, who was very respected in the community. He was an old man - maybe in the 70s, he was wise and nice, and everybody liked him.

I come from an immigrant family. Why I am [REDACTED_NAME] this ? Because this old man always tried to include the immigrants family who arrived in the country. At that time, the country where I live currently had an immigration vague and most people were not happy about that. Much of immigrants here suffered of racism, me included. OR, this man was so nice, so delicate. Always tried to understand us, poor immigrants, with our problems. He didn't have any problem with helping the parents, baby-sitting the kids, etc. He was so happy to do it ! and all the kids loved him ! Sometimes, me too, I would go with him. He was a very funny man.

&#x200B;

However, one day, when I was 13 years old, my mom didn't let me approach him, and it lasted like that for years. She sensed something weird.

&#x200B;

It was already too late.

&#x200B;

At the time. I don't even know how to write this. When I arrive at this part,  I physically cannot write this, even in another language. I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. My hands shake. I don't even know why. I censor myself, as if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to escape something.

But i have to do it. At the time, this man already did it. he already did the thing. He did not rape me, but he did... things. He touched my breast, he touched my clitoris. When we were alone, he would do comments on my body. He was saying things like ""You grew up so much !"" while touching my breast ; ""It's true that Africans grew up faster."" while looking at me.  It was between my 7 years old and 11 years old. One day, I was in his car, and he stopped the car. I was 11. He touched my hands, kissed it... he did comments too. He told me how I was beautiful, how I should not be afraid of him, how I always be your friend. i am [REDACTED_NAME] nauseated as I write this. This same day, he dropped me off to a friend of his, an old lady. THe old lady touched my breasts, looked at him, said ""She looks like a woman! These black girls have always good bodies. Look at her breast, and her hips!"" and he agreed and touched me where I didn't want.

I was so uncomfortable. I sensed that what this man and this old lady were doing was not right... But I couldn't say anything. My mouth was attached. I remember that I even put my hands in front of my breasts, as an act of defense, but the man pushed my hands away. Maybe was I scared. I don't know.

&#x200B;

He did all these things, always, always, when we were alone, sometimes even in the church where I was seeing him sometimes. I want to cry. How could he do that in God's house ? A saint house ? Even if you are not religious, you have to respect a sacred place, right ? An old man, wise like him, respected like him, appreciated like him. Why would he do that ? *Please, I am [REDACTED_NAME] of all of you, do not create in the comments a debate as if God exists or not, if christianity is good or not... Please. It's not what I want...*

&#x200B;

**But do you know the real irony ? The real reason I am [REDACTED_NAME] this post ?**

&#x200B;

As this man was doing these despicable things, you have to know that me, a young girl, was very much aware as what was a pedophile. I came from a country where children were disappearing all the times, where wanted poster were EVERYWHERE. I saw essays, documentaries, tons of them, of kidnapped children because it was the reality of my country. My parents educated me on how to recognize when an adult tried to make on me inappropriate things, and how I have to absolutely tell them if it happens... even if it was a friend.

&#x200B;

But... when this man did these things to me, it's like I couldn't recognize the patterns anymore. I couldn't. He was a friend ! MY friend ! Why would he do that ? how could he be a pedophile ? ""*Pedophile*"" was a terrifying word, a word that was for the ""rapists"", the strange-looking men in the streets, these people that I saw in documentaries. ""*Pedophile*"" was a long word, it could not apply to me. Oh, no ! It couldn't happen. Me ? A pedophile victim ?  And he, a pedophile ? this sweet old men ?

No, I did not recognize him as a pedophile. Even as today, I have trouble to say it. I want to vomit when I say it. I knew that the way he looked at me, the way he touched me was not correct at all. But... He couldn't do consciously these bad things, right ? A respected man like him. No, he couldn't. He was a man with principles, values, advices. No. no. no.

&#x200B;

When my mom prohibited me from seeing him, i was 13 years old. And because I had internalized, normalized, almost trivialized his attitude for years, yes, trivialized the wrong ; or maybe because it was more traumatizing that I wanted to admit... I **forgot**.

&#x200B;

Literally. Maybe my brain tried to protect me... I don't know. I forgot. All the things that he had done, I forgot. I was always seeing him, I was always a bit tense around him by this day, but I genuinely forgot. It's like all my memories had been suppressed in one day ; I couldn't remember anything !!So the weeks passed by, the months passed by. I don't recall any attempts from his part - maybe he did, but I do not remember, and the prohibition of my mother certainly restricted his range of actions. *I have to insist that my mother told me later that she didn't knew anything about his actions, but she had a weird feeling, like something was off.*

&#x200B;

So weeks passed by, months passed by, years passed by, and suddenly, I was in high school. I was still a minor.

And then, the man died. Had a blood disease. I think it was in 2021.

I cried very hard when I learned his death. Didn't come to school for two days. I was so sad. Genuinely. The community, the village, was very sad. All his friends, his wife mostly... All sad. I was at his funerals.

&#x200B;

The week following his death, I was scrolling on Twitter, and I saw a post about sexual assaults.

&#x200B;

Would you believe me if I tell you that suddenly, ALL of my memories came up ? ALL OF THEM. ALL. THe breasts, the comments, his attitude, his eyes, his hands, my panties, my clitoris. All... If I was writing in French, my feelings would be much better translated. As I realized the horror of the situation, I felt a devastating wave of disgust, sadness, and anger. I was disgusted at him ; disgusted that this jerk was DEAD ; disgusted at my breasts. I hated my breasts. I hated myself. In the shower, I hit myself. I hit myself a lot. I loathed myself. Those breasts, I saw the marks of those hands. Horrible. Gross. Those breasts couldn't belong to me. Neither did my body. I didn't like anything. Not a single thing. I wanted to cut all of these things. They weren't part of my body nor they were my body... It was his body. And he was dead, so my body was dead too. Realizing that was horrifying : he mocked me !

&#x200B;

This night when I discovered that, I did tons of nightmares. And it continue for the weeks, months after : nightmares, nightmares, nightmares. Even when I eventually told my mother. And even when I said it, I couldn't bring myself around the fact that I was... you know. Writing the *word* is impossible, but saying it out-loud is unachievable, insurmountable. Saying the name of the man was a difficulty that I never knew I could achieve... I tried to write it... I couldn't. My mom had to guess... I cried a lot. Very much. Even today, hearing is name makes me want to vomit.

&#x200B;

\--------

&#x200B;

I hate myself because there's nothing that I can do now. He is dead. I promised myself to not tell his wife - the situation is already complicated, and I don't know if she would survive this. I don't have anything against her.

&#x200B;

Yes, I hate myself for being so dumb, idiot, DUMB. All the signs were right in front of me, and I never said anything. Why ? Only because he was ""sweet"", he was my substitute grandpa. I want to cry. I don't understand how I COULDN'T notice anything... I was reading books about how, as a child, I can protect myself from pedophiles ! Why ????? Why couldn't I notice ?? I blame myself. I am [REDACTED_NAME] IDIOT. IDIOT. I hate  hate hate. He is dead ! And I noticed only AFTER his death ? What can I do... Nothing. He owes me an apology that I will never had. It's ok. I promised myself that I will forgive him, because I know that either way, I will never have the peace that I am [REDACTED_NAME] for. But I hate myself so, so much.

***Sometimes, I even have the impression that my brain is inventing all those memories. That I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to myself, that what happened is not true.***

&#x200B;

When I told my mom this story, she comforted me. With all her heart. Later, when i tried to speak once again about it, she told me that I should never talk again about it, because I will only suffer more ; that I must forgot or it will be too damaging for me. I understood where she was going for, and I tried... But now, I am [REDACTED_NAME] very sad. I don't want to die or something, quite the contrary, in reality... But I am [REDACTED_NAME], so sad. An haunting sadness, who goes and comes. Sometimes, I hate my body , next day, I don't mind.

I can't even talk to somebody, because either they won't believe me, either they will share the ""news"" to somebody else. I don't want that. As from my mother, she clearly told me to not speak about it again. My father doesn't even know about it.. It was already difficult to narrates one first time this traumatizing event, so once again...

&#x200B;

I continue to have some nightmares. It's been now 2 or 3 years. This story will never leave me, I fear. That's so dumb. I wasn't even raped, I should be thankful... I can't continue to complain when other people have it worst than me. But I am [REDACTED_NAME] desperate : it has been so long that I didn't speak about it, I have all my sadness contained in me... I hope that one day, I will be much happier.

&#x200B;

I am [REDACTED_NAME] sorry for the grammar, syntax, orthographic mistakes. I just wanted to ""throw off my chest"". I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. It was tiring to write in another language, and furthermore remembering all of these things for the second time... Writing for the first time. But I think I had to do it.

&#x200B;

My love/prayers go for all of the ones that are suffering.

Thank you to you all. Have a nice day. Best kisses.

n69hzq,1620313848.0,2021-05-06 15:10:48,TrueOffMyChest,Today my best friend had a mental breakdown. He is my best friend but I realized I was never his best friend.,"I have known Gary since my sophomore year, we have been best friends since then. He was always there for me no matter of the situation. When my ex cheated on me and dumped me, I was completely lost and had gone into depression because I loved her with my whole heart and never expected her to do that. After that I just spent my whole days in my room either playing games or masturbating. He saw this and came to my rescue, got me a gym membership, deleted every single porn video from my laptop and also got me into therapy. He even helped me preparing for my job interview because of which I have such a good job today.

He is the guy that everyone wants to be around, he is smart, charismatic, always smiling, funny and very down to earth. Many of our friends come to take advice from him because he gives good advice to everyone, he is a pure soul. Whenever I have a problem I go to him to talk about it. There are times I have cried in front of him. But today something different happened, we both were hanging out as usual and just having fun when suddenly out of nowhere he started crying and then he started hitting himself and acting wild. I went and hold him and tried to calm him down. I was just shocked I have never ever seen this man crying in my entire life, he is always smiling and laughing. He told me he cant handle it anymore, he is just exhausted and cant do it anymore. He kept repeating the same thing. I think he was referring to his job because. He asked me to drop him at his parents house and thats what I did.

While I was returning home I realized that he knows everything about me and my problems and I don't know nothing. He would always ask me about my problems but I never asked him about his. Every one came to talk to him about their problems but he had nobody to talk to. Right now I feel so disgusted at myself because the whole time I was selfish and thinking about myself. But I have decided that I will do anything in my power to get him out of this.",20512

I’m from a fairly dysfunctional family, that honestly seems like the poster for “generational trauma, the musical: on ice”, meaning we’ve always been a messy spectacle behind closed doors and picture-perfect from the outside. It would take way too long to explain how or why we ended up like this, so for the sake of brevity (this post will be long enough on its own): \*almost\* everyone means well in their own way, but the execution is a horror to behold, and somewhere in the middle of this mess I was born attached to it all.

 I’m currently in therapy for a long list of things, trying to work out my general resentment but so that you don’t have to bring this up to YOUR shrink, TW: CSA, Abuse, Probably Neglect, and maybe Narcissists? Also sorry about spelling/grammar/formatting, I’m emotional and if I stop typing I’ll psych myself out and take this to the graved take this to the grave. I’ll add a TLDR for those that don’t like reading but this post will be long because I honestly don’t feel like writing multiple parts. Also throwaway for obvious reasons.

When I was born, my uncle Mark (fake name) had already been questionable concerning being around children, or at least, a sane functioning family would have raised some concerns. You see his violent actions towards his own infant daughter my late cousin N, landed her to be wheelchair ridden, and physically and mentally disabled for the rest of her natural life, which was cut short because of these same lingering consequences of his actions at only 33 years old. Child protective services sniffed around but apparently didn’t find anything to take the other three children over, he claimed that he shook her because she wasn’t breathing, and it seemed that by the time I came along everyone was over it. If that’s all he’s done during his life maybe I’d shrug it off too like them, but I’ve got my own grudges against this guy.

So after absolutely no repercussions for his actions, my uncle Mark frequented every single large family gathering and had blended in as the devoted father and uncle, so the first ten years of my life he was exactly that. Now info about 10-year-old me: I was a small ball of energy, obsessed with the ninja turtles, and wanted to constantly play fight me saving the day. Now I’m a bit of a diehard punk, so I guess I never grew out of that. One evening, at my grandparents' house, I was with my parents attending a family function, and it was very much like any other night.

My dad ruffled my hair and asked me to fetch him a soda from my grandfather’s stash in his garage and I complied. I had almost completed my mission when I was intercepted by my uncle Mark coming out from the guest bathroom, and immediately I wanted to spice up my covert operation with a round of play fighting. I didn’t know something was off. I couldn’t have known. So I’m being silly and throwing fake punches with my tiny arms and ducking at random times even though he wasn’t engaging me at all. I still couldn’t tell that something was wrong.

I must have said something to egg him on, maybe like “C’mon Uncle Mark, you’re no fun” but I can’t remember exactly. That’s when he grabbed my wrist really hard and didn’t let go. I was startled, but I wasn’t scared until his pocket knife came out. He always carried that damn pocket knife around. He put it to my throat, and I froze. I looked at him and I finally realized his eyes were glazed, and that he didn’t look at all like my uncle right then. He smelled like booze.

That’s when he said something I’ll probably always carry with me. He told me “I could kill you right now. I could slit your little throat and no one would notice. I could put you under the floorboards, and no one would look for you. No one will miss you “

I cried. Like scream cried. My mom came running. I don’t remember what everyone else did but my mother says she made everyone aware of the situation. I never told her what he said until my 20s, though. For the longest time, I believed him.

&#x200B;

Sometimes as a grown-ass woman, I still believe him, because those thoughts were left to fester for way too long, and some circumstances further strengthened his words. For starters, nothing changed after the incident.

My mother says she tried to make sure I was never alone with him again, but honestly, she didn’t have to work very hard on that because I didn’t want to be alone with him either. I still had to hug him at social gatherings. I still had to see him every time someone had a birthday, a holiday, or other important family events. I did not handle this well, and sought comfort in a friend at school because I thought she really cared for me, though in retrospect we were ten, and a subject like that would have been heavy for any ten-year-old, so I cannot fully blame her for her subsequent reaction, but she decided to spread it around the school and disassociate herself from me, and I got kinda shunned at school for the situation, on top of my already being shy and socially awkward.

Now some people may think “so? Your uncle says something bad and you’re scared for life?” And to tell you the truth, yes. In fact, I’m traumatized.

But I feel the need to fully vent about my life and how this moment weighed on me when things continued to get worse.

My overall mental health plummeted and so did my physical health, as I ended up with a nasty abscess in my lymph nodes that very year, and ended up being hospitalized for months because it got infected. At this time, I didn’t get daytime visitors, and the hospital, which has since been investigated for multiple malpractice violations, had me significantly more medicated than what was appropriate to keep me civil. I didn’t fully blame them, nurses were overworked back then and it’s only gotten worse, but there are still better ways of dealing with, a hysterical 10-year-old constantly throwing up fits in pediatrics because she’s afraid, than a little extra morphine. As a result of this decision, I spent months of my days alone, trying not to wonder why no one would come to see me. One of the few people who did, were my grandparents, and while they have their problems too, the stuffed rabbit I got from them is my most important comfort item to this day. (His name is bunbun, he’s a chad.)

&#x200B;

I was unfortunately not the only one who had noticed that I had lots of alone time during my stay, as during this time I also was molested by this guy who’s kid was also in the same wing as me, and had even been my roommate during the beginning of my stay before the infection set in and I needed more urgent care.

I wrote it off in my memory for so long. I’d forgotten about the worst of it and told myself that the reoccurring dreams I’d have of this man were only nightmares. But one day in my 20’s my mother mentions to me about the time she “chased some weirdo in his underwear out of my room one night “ and I had to deal with the shock of having to admit it was real. When I recovered, it was business as usual, back to gatherings, back to pretending my uncle Mark didn’t do anything.

On occasion he’d whip out his pocket knife and play with it, like an absolute psychopath, like he was taunting me, but I continued to say nothing.

I began to deeply resent my family, for not protecting me, for not doing more to fix this, for covering up and carrying on. And I started dreaming of an escape, where one day I’d get married one day, and I’d personally send a letter to my uncle explaining what he’s done and why he’ll never get to be in my adult life, and anyone who tried to counter my decision or defend him wouldn’t get to either. It’d be my first proper boundary and I’d stand firm on it for the sake of my future family, and I could finally have a space where the word family doesn’t make me feel cynical.

I will never get the pleasure of orchestrating that moment.

I thought I got my break when COVID hit and he turned into a radical anti-vaxer, and was told he couldn’t be in our bubble unless he was vaccinated, but my grandparents later recalled that decision.

Things really came to a head when I was 23, and suddenly felt as if I were having a stroke, only to learn that that was a panic attack, and I was suddenly admitted into the psych ward for what I now call “grippy socks vacations”. I got on medication for my crippling anxiety and I was assigned a temporary therapist to help me transition back to normal life. It’s there where I got the inspiration that, I indeed could set a boundary that I didn’t have to see him anymore.

That’s easier said than done though. Remember “generational trauma on ice”? Yeah that comes in to play here, because my grandparents put lots of pressure on my father for me to continue my charade, and while I didn’t want to be NC with all my family it was the only opportunity I had to exist without seeing this man, because no one else wanted to eliminate the problem person from the equation, and everyone refused to acknowledge why I really wasn’t there.

Things came to a head last year, during the holidays. The pressure to be present with family was immense on all sides, and I ended up fighting with my parents a lot. Ultimately I wanted this season to be peaceful for both myself and my family so I removed myself from the equation and spent Christmas and new years at a friends place on their couch while I was trying to decide what I was going to do.

&#x200B;

My mother kept trying to convince me to compromise, trying to hold financial aid that I needed at the time very badly (which is a totally different story) over my head at the cost of going to a gathering once a year. I was desperate enough that I agreed last week, because despite all my hard work I realized how important this was, and that the sacrifice was worth the prospect of a better future.

If it weren’t for a few days ago, that’d be the end of my story. But suddenly, and with no warning, my Uncle Mark died. He had an infection in his pancreas, and apparently, there was nothing the doctors could really do. And I’m still stunned. I know it's kinda messed up, but I couldn't help but feel a little happy when I heard. But then I felt guilty for feeling happy about it. Like, I know I shouldn't wish bad things on anyone, but it's hard not to when someone's been so terrible. It's a weird mix of emotions, for sure, knowing that because he's not around anymore I’m free. I won’t ever have to miss Christmas, or my own birthday party, or Thanksgiving, anything, ever again. I have little cousins who I’ve never actually met since they were born during the pandemic. I have younger cousins who have graduated recently, and I lament not being around for much of their teen years. I feel like that man has taken so much from me and finally, I have my family back again. We’re still “generational trauma, on ice, the musical “ but it’s what I have and when you’ve spent five years without seeing them even this messy dysfunctional family feels better than nothing at all. I still have loads of work to do and I don’t know how I’m going to get over the lasting effect this all has had on me, but I’ll maybe get there one day. For those of you who read through my summary of my own series of unfortunate events, thank you! I’m sure it hasn’t been easy. TLDR: my uncle assaulted me when I was ten, bad shit happened and I’m primed to get my therapist a therapist of their own, I’m conflicted but ultimately happier he’s dead.

12h06t3,1681084068.0,2023-04-09 23:47:48,TrueOffMyChest,I Saw a Ghost and my Life is Ruined (Update),"I hadn't planned on updating. The original post got so little traction I didn't think there was much point. But someone requested it. I tried to post this earlier and it was removed. I don't know why. 

Assuming this works, for whatever it's worth, here it is.

Summary: I saw the ghost of my father about six months ago. The experience was terrifying, obtuse and confusing. The combination of feeling like no one believed me and having to re-think my entire view of the universe made me feel like my life was falling apart.

Where to start.

1. A couple of people suggested that I had just fallen asleep. But I don't think so. I have, at various times in my life, been so tired I've hallucinated, fallen asleep with my eyes open (and had dream that happened in the room I was staring at) and been so sick I was delirious. None of that felt like this. Dreams feel real when you're having them but seldom afterward. My experience was very clear and very lucid. I was sitting, I was reading, I remember what I was reading, there was no break in consciousness. And then my father's ghost appeared. And then he went away. Absolutely no indication that my state of mind was altered at any point.

2. Someone suggested CO monitors. I also didn't think it was likely that I had just enough CO in the apartment to cause a single hallucination but not enough to cause any other symptoms, but since it was an easy one to cross off the list, I got a couple. Nothing.

3. Some people questioned why I needed so badly to be believed. And wondered why I couldn't just accept it and move forward. And that's fair enough. But I kept thinking about the kids in the Narnia stories. They went to Narnia and were kings and queens there for decades before finding the door back and being teleported to the moment they left. So what do they do now? The rest of their lives, they either need to lie to anyone close to them or be thought insane. Imagine if you're dating someone and they sit you down and say, ""I have you tell you something. When I was nine years old I found a magic door in a dresser that lead to another world where my siblings and I fought a witch, saved a talking lion, and ruled as king for fifty years before being sent back in time to when I left. And it's important to me that you believe me.""

Maybe some of you would believe that. I suspect most people wouldn't. Imagine that was you. How isolating it would be. I know it's not exactly the same, but that's how I felt. This thing had happened to me, this thing that felt huge and powerful and central to who I was, and I couldn't TALK about it because any time I tried I was either believed-that-I-believed it or was told I was just dreaming. And the fact that it was my father I saw made it worse, because then my relationship with him became the story when it really wasn't.

Anyway. So then what happened?

I had a very hard few weeks after my first post. Still barely slept, barely ate. Hung up on by such a thread at work that my boss's boss gave me some ""bonus"" vacation so I could ""rest up"" after a recent successful project and ""come back fresh."" Which was (and is) humiliating, but survivable. I have a good relationship with my boss(es) and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] good at a job that's very hard to do well.

My fiancée was worried but supportive. She could see that I was under severe (and uncharacteristic) distress. I tried talking to her again. Tried explaining how much her lack of belief hurt me. How isolated and distant I felt as a result. How I needed her to believe me, to really, really believe me that I saw the ghost of my father. She gave me what she could. She asked me to tell her the story again. And then asked me a bunch of pointed questions about it. Not in a ""and how does that make you feel"" sort of way like a therapist. More like a police interrogation. Which sounds horrible, but honestly my fiancée is by far the smartest person I've ever met (and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] dummy) and having her sit down and focus and apply the full force of her considerable intellect to my story made me feel better all on its own.

At the end, she said ""Assuming you're remembering it all clearly, it doesn't sound like there's a simple explanation. It doesn't sound like anything else. I still don't know if I believe in ghosts in any real sense, but I do believe something very significant happened to you, and if you say it was a ghost then I have to accept that.""

Which wasn't what I was hoping for, but it was something. At the very least it opened the lines of communication between us so I talk about the difficulty I was having and why. And it gave her the opportunity to suggest that seeing a doctor was a good next step. Which I agreed to.

I did all I could to keep my increasing desperation away from my kids. I was mostly successful but they noticed. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] very positive and upbeat and very little bothers me for long. Seeing me so stressed and haggard and grim really worried them. I eventually told them I was having a problem sleeping (which was true enough). And my oldest (17F) said I should just get some sleeping pills. And we laughed. But then realized she was right.

Sleeping pills hadn't even occurred to me. I had been so focused on solving 'the problem' that I gave hardly a thought to treating the symptoms. So I talked to my GP got prescribed something and it made a world of difference. I was still struggling with feelings of isolation, still anxious and nervous all the time, still picking away at the memories like a scab, but my most immediate problem was that it had been three months since I'd slept more than two hours at a stretch and I was at the raggedy edge of my physical, mental, and emotional resources. After a few days' real sleep I was no longer feeling like I was at the very edge of drowning every second of every day. Nothing was fixed at this point, but I found I could mostly make it through the day without looking like I was dying.

And I went to see a neurologist. My father's side of the family has some history of early-onset Alzeimer's so it was easy enough to get a referral. The original appointment was nine months out but I called every Monday around the same time and politely asked about cancellations (""I'll take anything, even on short notice""). And sure enough after about a month of this I got a call asking if I could be there in an hour. I told them I could (if there's one universal, ironclad rule for living it's this: always be nice to receptionists).

And I got a full neurological work-up. During the course of the exam I told the doctor I'd had one ""hallucination"" and I told him the story. The exam did not turn up anything concerning or unusual. I asked the doctor about my ""hallucination"" (and admitted that's really why I was there). And he said, quite calmly ""Well have you considered the possibility that you actually saw a ghost?"" Which completely rocked me back. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] easily made speechless, but that did it.

He said, ""I've been doing this for 35 years and usually when someone complains about hallucinations it's because their great-aunt Phyllis appeared to them in a dream and told them to blow up a community centre or they're noticing that the government is sending them coded messages in their alphabet soup. And so we deal with that. But sometimes someone like you comes in who's otherwise healthy and in command of their faculties, and a very strange thing happened to them. And they, like you, jump to the conclusion that something is wrong with them. But I think some of the time, probably whatever they think happened to them has just actually happened to them.""

And I just broke. I broke. Almost six months of stress and anxiety and terror and holding everything in and not giving myself even the tiniest bit of slack to loosen up and I just broke. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] usually a crying person but I sat in that nice old doctor's nice old office and I put my face in my hands and I wept for what felt like hours.

The nice old doctor gave me some tissue and waiting until I started getting hold of myself. And he said, ""The world is wide. Maybe understanding everything is not only impossible, but undesirable. Sometimes the greatest gift we can give ourselves is learning to live in mystery.""

Which wasn't exactly revolutionary advice, but his casual, off-hand acceptance that I did see a ghost felt like having an infected boil lanced. The event, and the pain and confusion it caused, was all still there, but all of the horrid painful beating pulsing hot ragged suffering has bled out of it.

After that, I found that I was able to accept, and tale comfort from,  my fiancée's care and concern. I found that was able to hear (and access) my therapist's empathy and advice. I found I was able to take her advice and consider the event in terms of what I needed from people and figure out how to ask for it without everything just spiraling down into the howling frustration of being utterly alone.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] wrestling over what it all means (if anything) and what I do about it (if anything).

Sleep is still harder to find, and bad dreams often close by whenever I do. And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] very anxious and jumpy in the dark, or when I feel a cold draft, or smell roses.

But I seem to be on the mend.

I doubt I'll do any more updates on this. Thank you to all those who tried to help.",28
ljde3n,1613263262.0,2021-02-14 00:41:02,TrueOffMyChest,"I had to put my elderly dog down, and I just want to tell someone about him so he doesn't just disappear without being remembered.","My dog Phoenix (Feenie) had to cross the rainbow bridge this past Wednesday. He made it to 17. I've been trying to post about him on Facebook as a tribute, and to let people know that I've had to say goodbye to him, but every time I start, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] crying and can't bear looking through his photos and can't find the right words to describe in a few sentences what a great dog he was. So this is probably going to be a longer, rambly post, to people who don't even know me nor Feenie, but I feel like he deserves to be remembered by the world somehow. 

I've moved from Germany to New Zealand in 2003, and got him in my first year here, when he was just 4 months old. I wasn't even looking for a dog at the time. He was sitting in a pet shop window when I walked past. He had a blue eye and a brown eye and all black fur. Husky cross. I went inside just to look at him. They told me he's for free and he acted like ""pick me up"" (while all the other puppies ignored me) - so I did. 
He's been ""my family replacement"" all this time. He also was my friend, my baby, my child, my protector, my teddy bear and the guy who made me smile every single day for nearly 17 years. He wasn't the smartest dog (would always tangle himself up on his leash), or the bravest (he was terrified of thunder and fireworks and ate half my car, a small tree, and a garage door due to loud sounds that he wanted to escape from). But he was the kindest, happiest dog I've ever met. Never even growled at anyone. I had to teach him how to bark. He would always want to meet every person and dog when we were out, just to say hello. He got bitten for it a few times, but never fought back. He never flinched at the vet when he got injections. In fact he loved going to the vet, because he got a treat at the end. One time the vet forgot to give him a treat and when we got to the car, Feenie looked so sad! I went to the nearest shop and bought a bag of treats. 
He also had the softest fur, and it would take on the smell of freshly washed sheets when he was lying on them. Everyone was always amazed how soft he was when they touched him. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] scared that I'll forget how soft he felt because it was unreal. Our favourite way to cuddle was by him lying on top of me on the couch or bed. Not easy to balance a large 23kg dog flat on top of you. But he'd just lay all still like that for ages while I would rub his chest and sniff his ears (they also smelled amazing). He could make one sound, that sounded like he was saying the word ""Who"". And he had the best comedy timing. Each time my partner and I would argue, and one of us would say for example ""I can't believe you forgot to lock the car again"", Feenie would make this huffing sound as if he was saying ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] disappointed in you"" and it would make us laugh every time. 
He was amazing at getting the ball. And I mean amazing. He made it his life mission to catch balls mid-air before they got near the ground. He'd outrun any other dog to get to that ball first. And his jumps looked so artistic and skilled. Then he'd bring the ball back to you and place it in your hand or on the tennis racket for you to throw again. 
With all that jumping he did, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that he lived this long. Dogs his size are only meant to get to 12 or 13. I was so lucky to have him until 17. But that makes it harder somehow because you get so used to him always being there. And now he's gone. We had one last trip to the beach in early December (my birthday), and after that he just went downhill. He'd have one good day and one bad day. He wasn't eating much, had trouble walking. I carried him to the lawn. He drank heaps and kept me up every night needing to pee. But, whenever I thought ok this is the end, the next day he was fine again. This went on for the last two months.  Until the bad days stayed and no more good days came, and I had to make that final appointment at the vet, but it was so hard. It felt like he just refused to die so I had to arrange that for him. I know it was the right decision but I hated having to pick a ""time of death"" for him and I had this stupid countdown in my head, how many hours he's got left.  That was Wednesday at 4pm. It was like he knew because this time he didn't seem keen to go into the vet's. But that could also be because I couldn't stop crying all day. I got him chicken nuggets, and then we had to say goodbye. It was quick and I know he's pain free now. That evening, when I was cooking, his food bowl fell over twice. It might have been because I was shifting something on the bench nearby, but I'd like to think it was him saying he's still around. I miss him. And I want to tell the world that he was so good for me in so many ways. He unexpectedly came into my life, made it better every single day, and now he's gone. I'll never forget him.

PS: There's a birthday pic of him from 2 years ago in my post history. 
PPS: Thank you guys for your kind comments. I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] emotional blob right now anyway but it really helps that I was able to share this here.

One more edit: Bed time for me here in NZ now. I tried to reply to as many of you as I could - sorry if I missed anyone.  Earlier today I was amazed when 189 people had upvoted this. Now we're at 7.5k. I thank each and every one of you reading this. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] touched that all of you now know that Feenie existed,  Feens himself would have been so thrilled because he loved getting attention from strangers. Thank you again, and good night.",11388
sjv14e,1643924059.0,2022-02-03 21:34:19,TrueOffMyChest,"My ex called to let me know, the guy she left me for is going to release her nudes unless she sends him more. And I realized I don’t care.","So as the title says, my ex called me out of the blue a few nights ago to let me know this. 

We were together for over 5 years. She left me over a year ago because she said our relationship went in a different direction then she liked. I got a better job making more money so we can get married. But even before I got that job she still seemed attention for over 3 years in the relationship. I guess she really liked one guy because she wound up sexting with him for over 2 years. She would always talk about him, take his recommendations for restaurant picks or movies and would just be happy when he talked to her. Basically she said I shouldn’t worry about him. I always knew something was wrong but couldn’t really prove it. This guy convinced her (not sure if that’s the right word) but more or less said that he would be able to make her happy all the time but the only way is if she left me.

When she said she was leaving me I was heartbroken. She said, “her and this guy were just “friends” at first but soon she realized the feelings she had for him. he will make her happier than she’s ever been and she’s going to move in with him.” The only reason why I know the timeline is because we had a family plan and the phone was in my name, so I did see the text when she said happy 2nd anniversary. I was even more heartbroken. Reading some of what she wrote was more heartbreaking. I erased everything on the phone. 

She never told her family and friends the real reason as to why. Just said we “drifted apart”. She did tell her best friend sometime later the real reason as to why. Her best friend then told me, “my ex did go to move in with the guy but found out he was married with 2 kids and not ready to commit just yet but it should be soon.” So my ex moved back in with her parents. So basically my ex was a side chick for this guy. Her best friend told me this because it would be better for me to heal. Her best friend was right I went to therapy cut down on drinking and stopped praying for death. Got reconnected with my best friend and me and her have been happy ever since. 

A few nights ago I kept getting a call from this number. I did reverse number search and nothing would appear. No voicemail, no nothing. So I happen to answer the call and it was my ex. I have one word responses to her small talk and asked her as to why she’s been trying to get in touch with me. My ex basically confessed about lying to me about the timeline of events. I told her I know. She then said nothing got physical after we broke up(it was her idea to get physical after she left me apparently ). I told her I don’t care. After a long pause I said, “you didn’t all of a sudden call to confess about this, what’s really wrong, please be truthful.” My ex then said, “well she gave the guy the same ultimatum about being happy but the guy said he couldn’t do that.” Well my ex said she would stop seeing him and stop sending nudes. The guy said the physical part wasn’t what he was after, he had other girls for that but the nudes is what he wants. I guess that crushed my ex and she said no. He said he would leak her nudes if she didn’t send more (apparently they’re a lot). After another long pause all I said is, “that’s it?” I guess it wasn’t the response my ex was expecting from me. She said this was serious, I told her, “is it, so what are you going to do?” My ex said she needed advice. I gave it to her, I said, “go to the police, get a lawyer, gather all evidence.” She said, “well this was all done through phone call, she always deleted nudes (now, but not before) if I still have the texts on her old phone.” I said well it’s a case of you said he said and no I removed them as I didn’t want the reminder of your betrayal. She asked if I can file the police report on her behalf and go to the lawyer on her behalf or with her. I said, “you must be joking.” “You’re very well capable of doing all of this.” “Just search on google for a lawyer and go to the police in the morning.” Then I said, “I don’t know what this has to do with me.” Her reply was, “well I thought you were my friend and you would help me, I’m your ex doesn’t this make you upset, why am I not supporting her.” “If it gets out I don’t want to make you look bad”. It took my a while but I did say, “we haven’t talked in over year, removed and blocked each other from social media, me being your ex has nothing to do with a situation you got yourself in or about me being upset, were you upset when you left me? “How would your nudes leaking make me look bad, you didn’t care about making me look bad in the relationship no need to start now. ”What about your friends and family?” “You must’ve hit the bottom of the barrel in trying to get me to help you.”Her family is extremely conservative, so she said, “if they found out about my situation they would probably disown her and her friends wouldn’t talk to her again.” My ex admits to being the one that messed up in this situation and doesn’t want others to know. I said, “that has nothing to do with me.” “It sucks you’re in this situation but nothing to do with me.” I do wish you the best in this situation. She said, “can you at least talk to him and reason with him to not release anything?” I once said, “you must be fucking with me, talk to the same guy who you had an affair with. “The same guy who was just a friend and nothing to worry about, the guy who was going to make you happy, that same guy?” “Sorry that’s not going to happen.” After her crying, I said, “well good luck in your situation and hung up.” Then I blocked her number afterwards. 

My girlfriend who heard this conversation said it sounded like you didn’t care and that’s not me And I told her, I didn’t. I care about family and friends, my ex isn’t either. The choices she mad during our relationship and after, lead her to the path that she’s on now. I don’t want anything to do with this situation. That’s her mess that she has to clean up. Don’t get me wrong, no one deserves to be in that situation that she is. Probably a month after breaking up knowing me I would’ve rushed to help. But I realized I don’t have to do this. I don’t have the time nor do I have the energy to get caught up in this. If the situation was reversed she wouldn’t help me. So I refuse to get caught up in that mess. I just don’t care. Saying I just don’t care makes it feel good to get it off my chest.",7383
12q6ano,1681783533.0,2023-04-18 02:05:33,TrueOffMyChest,Found a video online of my dad who abandoned us when I was 6...,"I found a video of my dad online. He's been out of our lives since I was 6 so I haven't seen him in 20 yrs. I know he loves/loved dancing and used to bring a ton of women home. He used to get mad at my mom for not dancing with him bc she was raising the family and running the family business alone. He also would get mad at her for not being as ""hot"" as the other women he was seeing. He even tried to make a deal with her once where he agreed to help with the family two days of the week and go out with other women all the other days. Eventually he moved across the country to pursue his dreams of being a free man to fuck other women. Lmfao. 

WELL.... Recently I got curious and searched his name and I found this video of him posted within the last month on YouTube dancing and doing tango with his new wife or whoever she is. Lemme just say... My eyes have been assaulted. He sucks in many ways and his dancing probably sucks more than he sucked as a dad... Which is really saying something. ANYWAY...just wanted to tell strangers anonymously bc I can't tell this sorta private personal stuff to people in my life.

Edit: Woah I wasn't expecting this to blow up. Thank you for all the support and kind words. It is really depressing to hear that so many people found this post relatable. My heart goes out to you all. Big hugs. And for those of you who want to send nasty comments on his YouTube that seriously made me laugh out loud.

She did give me some advice and told me that I have been in an abusive relationship all my life and that in order to heal whatever is broken in me that I should cut out my father as he sets the tone for my treatment by the rest of my family(she had pointed out the many ways my father has hurt me or had encouraged my family to mistreat me). She said I’d always be stagnated and unhappy if I continued to associate myself with my family and former friends. I told her that I cut them out of my life and that I’ve got my first therapy session scheduled in a few days. She said she was proud of me for taking my first step into healing.

&#x200B;

Story time!

It’s been a few months since the last shitty climax to the last year of my life.

To start, I lost my father a little over a year ago. It was sudden, and it wrecked my whole world. My dad was not perfect, but I grew up a daddy’s girl. He wasn’t the most healthy, but I never imagined he would die at 60 years old. 8 months following this, I was hit with another bombshell. One of my best friends, we’ll call him Jake, passed away. He was a perfectly healthy, and allegedly it was pneumonia. I say allegedly, simply because his parents chose not to dig deeper into the cause of his death. I respect this choice, of course, as knowing exactly how he passed wouldn’t make it any more painful. I won’t lie, when I was awoken the next morning to the news, the first thought that crossed my mind was suicide. He was physically healthy, but I know that he was having a really rough time mentally. He lost who he thought was the love of his life and struggled with alcohol problems as well. I feel guilty thinking that he would do that to himself.

Anyway, Jake was like a brother to my partner, we’ll call him Tom. They had such a massive bond. Jake came on every family vacation we would have with Tom’s family. He would occasionally sleep in bed with Tom and I on these vacations, totally platonically, watching shows and just talking about life and everything really. Jake was like an adopted son to Tom’s parents, so needless to say this loss really shook all of our worlds. The grief was immense, and as Jake was one of my best friends, I understood that the bond he had with my partner was different, deeper in a sense. We tried to recover best we could and make it through each day with out his goofy laugh or infectious smile.

Well, fast forward 3-4 months, Tom got hit with a terrible stomach flu. We slept in different rooms so that I might not catch it. Once Tom recovered, I then got the stomach flu, so we continued to sleep apart. It was hard, because it was such a bad sickness that all I wanted to do was crawl up in Tom’s arms. But, because of how bad the flu was, I understood that Tom was afraid of catching it again (even though it’s very rare to catch the same sickness twice, I tried to understand the distance). One night, I was having a really hard time grief wise. I missed my dad so much, which I assume was brought up by the fact that growing up when I was sick my dad did not care whether or not he caught it, he would hold me through each and every night. Even in adulthood, if I called my dad sick he would always offer to come pick me up and bring me to my mom and dads to recover so they could take care of me. This grief being brought up also flooded the loss of Jake up too. When Tom came to get something from the bedroom, I broke and told him I was having a really hard time. I told him that I wish he could sleep with me tonight and he just said he doesn’t want to get sick again. All while I was balling about my dad and Jake. He said sorry and then just stood at the edge of the bed and watched as I cried hysterically in so much emotional pain. I finally got fed up and asked him if he could at least come comfort me and hug me or something instead of just staring at me. He finally hesitantly approached me and came over and gave me a one armed hug. I asked if he was mad at me for yelling at him to come hug me and he said no. Then through all the emotion I said you still want to be with me right? Even though I’m a mess. He didn’t respond, and my heart sank. I told him he couldn’t just not say anything to that. He just said “I don’t know”. Quickly my tears faded and my emotions turned into heartbreak and fear. I have been with Tom for nearly 7 years. I know that grief can really fuck you up and put a lot of things in perspective. When I lost my dad my grief counselor told me doubt and wanting to change your life afterward was normal, so I tried to remain calm and supportive with his feelings, even though that I don’t know cut like a blade. I told him that he couldn’t just go to bed on that and we atleast needed to talk through a little bit of it to ease my mind. So he sat and he said losing Jake has really fucked him up and made him unsure about everything. Holding back as many tears as I could, I told him I understood. I then asked what he needed to figure out what he wanted in life. We came to the conclusion of a little time apart. We then decided we needed sleep (we worked the next day) and he left. I spent the entire night crying my eyes out. Little to no sleep. We decided we would talk the next day after work. I got home from work around 430, he typically would get home at 5:15. Well, 6PM rolled around and he hadn’t reached out to update me, so I messaged him and asked when he would be home. No response. Frustrated I sent another message that stated if he wasn’t home in 30 minutes I wouldn’t be there. He responded then and said sorry work was busy. I told him that it would be nice if he had more of a sense of urgency when it came to my feelings and our relationship. He responded with I’ll be home soon. He finally made it home around 615, and we went on a walk. We talked about boundaries for this time apart, and we landed on me staying with my mom for a week. I was totally supportive and told him if he needed me at all I would be there for him. I then asked him if he wanted this time apart to be open, where we can explore our options. I am a pretty lax person when it comes to sex as long as it is discussed, although he never needed to use that because he always said he was monogamous. I offered this so that it might show him if he really wants to spend the rest of his life with me. I told him I was sure of him and sure that I saw a future with him, but if he wanted it to be open we could both explore that further so we both have the opportunity to test our doubts. Granted, were it to be open I might have gone out to a bar and MAYBE kissed someone, but deep down I know that I was attached to him and didn’t want anyone else. That being said, it would have been fair and given us both the opportunity to explore. He said no, he doesn’t want to see other people. He just needed space to think. I said ok and I went inside and packed up some of my essentials and left. This was a Friday.

I was alone at my moms from Friday-Thursday because she was out of town. On Tuesday Tom and I talked on the phone. I genuinely don’t remember what the reason was, because all I remember was this: he told me he did one of the worst things he has ever done. He cheated. The DAY after I left. He was at work on Saturday, went and got his hair cut, went to a bar, and fucked a girl in the parking lot in her car. I told him I had to go after asking him how he could do that to me, especially after I OFFERED for this to be an open break. He had never once in the 7 years of our relationship given me ANY reason to believe he would cheat. After this phone call I was a mess. I cried harder and felt more broken than ever. I just wanted to run to my dad and cry in his arms and I couldn’t. I wanted to call my best friend, as he had always been a great unbiased person to talk to about things, but I couldn’t. I felt so broken. Devastated. Part of me blamed myself for even bringing up the open break, thinking that was what led him to think that it would be ok. I don’t know.

Anyway, fast forward a couple days, he came over so we could talk. I told him I would be willing to try and see if I could forgive him, but told him that there was going to need to be a lot of effort on his part. I needed him to show me that he truly believed I was all he wanted and sleeping with someone else made him realize that, like he claimed. So, we planned a date. I told him things couldn’t go back to easy and comfortable, and we needed to rewind back to the dating stage. He agreed and planned a whole date. Pinball arcade and dinner. I was actually excited and it took a little of the pain away from the heartbreak. Seeing him actually try for once in years brought me a feeling I hadn’t felt in years of being together. We ended up having the greatest sex of our life that night, ngl. Assuming it was all of the emotions in the air. Well, day of the date he texts me at 12 and said he didn’t think it was going to work out because the brunch he was at was running late and he was relying on his parents for a ride home. I told him we could just do it later and he said he wouldn’t be hungry. I told him ok great then just don’t come I guess. I fell asleep on my moms bed at 1PM and slept until 9PM. Woke up with no texts from him, no calls, nothing. This infuriated me. This was his attempt at effort? I’m sorry but you cheated. I don’t care if I said don’t come, if you really wanted it to work out you should be worshipping the ground the person that is working to forgive you walks on. Something. Not even a big grand gesture. At the very least show up and apologize. Something. Anything. It was then I realized it wasn’t going to work out. I didn’t trust him enough to make any changes to the stagnant life we had been living together.

When I called him and explained all of this to him he basically said I make no sense cause I told him not to come. I said whatever. He said this isn’t gonna work out if any messed up date was gonna cause a fight. I told him he was right and we needed to meet up and talk again. So we did, and the conclusion was either we try for another month and see where it goes, or just break up. He said he wanted to try for another month. I told him that I thought that decision was a very unhealthy part of himself making that choice. I told him that I think that we needed to just break up, and if we find ourselves back together great, but it wasn’t something that could have been forced. I cried, and the only thing he cried about was losing our cat.

So, we broke up. I went that next weekend and packed all my stuff up with the help of my friends and moved out. My brother came by to take a load to my moms, and he very much wanted to go in and punch Tim. I jokingly told this to Tom’s mom, and all she said was “it takes two”. I’m sorry, what? It takes two for one of us to cheat???? Fuck that. His mom was never rooting for us. I tried with him, and even he admitted that. I tried to fix or communication problems we had before, tried to get him to go out with me, tried to encourage therapy…. I tried so hard to fix the problems we had for years. I put so much energy into making the relationship work. She thought we were toxic for each other which in many ways she was right, but that is no excuse to cheat. He was there while we were packing and didn’t lift a finger to help. When I went to say goodbye to him, he asked to fuck one last time. I told him I didn’t want that and I was sorry and he said it’s fine. As I sat in the driveway getting ready to leave he spam messaged me pushing the fact that he wanted to have sex again. I ignored it and drove away. That drive home was one of the hardest drives of my life. I wanted to turn around 30 times and go back to him. He was messaging me the entire way home pretty much making it that much harder, and every song that played on my Spotify was somehow perfect for the occasion. Oh and it was raining. A part that makes me laugh looking back was there was this cat toy that kept chirping every time my car jerked at all. In my head I was like bitch shut up I’m trying to be sad. Anyway, a month or so passed of us hardly talking, then we started trying to be friends.

During this time, I had a friend night labeled as hot girl/guy summer with my friend, Tyler, and my two oldest friends who were a couple Greg and John. We went to a gay bar and had a blast. It was fun. I got trashed, and we left, and Tyler drove me and him back to my place (he was staying at my place cause he was visiting from PA). I got in the bath when I got home and sobered up a bit just to come to a horrifying realization. Through all of this I had realized that through the numbness I felt for the passed few years of my life with Tom, I was in love with my best friend, Greg, who was engaged to my other friend, John. The irony of that is that I was the matchmaker there. It was a secret I wanted to take to my grave so as to not lose any more friends. They were engaged and happy and I didn’t plan on ruining that no matter what my feelings. So, after my bath I put clothes on and walked out to the porch where Tyler was chilling. I started sobbing and he hugged me and asked what was wrong and I told him that I think I am [REDACTED_NAME] love with Greg. (Greg is pansexual btw, where John is gay). Greg and I had a little crush on each other in high school but it never went anywhere, and shortly after this I introduced him to John and they’ve been together ever since. Tyler held me and apologized and asked if I was planning to do anything about it and I told him no.

Shortly after this, they chose to have a wedding just in case the laws get changed to make their marriage official before their bigger wedding. I was supposed to officiate their big wedding. I realized that I couldn’t do that anymore. I also didn’t ever fully support them being together as John went through a sex addiction (he was cheating on Greg for a long ass time) and caused Greg a lot of pain that I don’t think I ever fully forgive John for. Me and John had been friends longer than Greg and I, but honestly John and I went through a lot of stuff that strained that friendship, including the respect I lost for him with the cheating. Obviously, Greg moved past it considering it was an addiction and chose to stay with him. With this impromptu mini wedding, I worried because I had heard from John how excited he was, but Greg never confided in me once about how he felt. That worried me and made me think that he wasn’t thinking about if it was what he really wanted. So, stupidly I told them before the little wedding (I wasn’t officiating this one) that I couldn’t officiate their big wedding. Unfortunately, the only explanation I could offer was that I didn’t completely support the marriage. I told them that I felt like Greg didn’t think it through because he hadn’t come to me at all about his excitement, doubt, nothing.

Now, I know I was wrong to act that way. I should have made up some excuse about stage fright or something. I know a big part of me was being selfish and childish. I wish I could take back how I handled it. We talked about it a bit and cleared up some things, and I apologized for how I handled it, especially so close to their wedding. I think in reality it was a hail Mary to see if it was really what Greg wanted, without me having to tell him I was in love with him. After apologizing they told me that they forgave me and I thought we had moved on from that.

I was still invited to their small wedding and attended. It was nice. Very cute and very them.

Well, then for about a month I was ignored by them. I reached out many times, going through a lot of grief. I lost my dad, best friend, partner of 7 years and my second family. That stuff doesn’t just go away, and I get that people have lives… but I was like… fully ignored by them. No responses, no “sorry we are dealing with stuff, but we will reach out when we can”. Nothing. Then one night I went out to the bars (was basically sitting alone in a corner LMAO) and reached out to an old friend (Jane) to see if she wanted to hang the next day. She told me that she was going to the Ren Faire with a few friends including John, as Greg was babysitting family. I felt heartbreak. I assumed we were not friends anymore. I reached out to them and invited them to go to the bars with me that night, and they didn’t think of inviting a person they considered their best friend? Jane invited me to go, but I didn’t want to go at that point. I ended up ubering home early and just crying. The next day I sent them a text telling them I felt really neglected and asked if I did something to make them ignore me. Greg responded with apologies and basically just played the pity card. He said all this shit he was dealing with which I get, but it takes less than 30 seconds to tell me that you’re going through something, so I don’t think that they hate me or don’t want to be my friend anymore. An entire month of not receiving any responses to any of my messages. Then John responded and said he was still hurt with me not supporting their marriage. Which again, is completely valid, but to ignore someone you call your best friend for an entire month instead of just sending a quick, “hey I’m going through some stuff and will reach out as soon as I can”. Anything to show me that my friends since middle and high school weren’t ghosting me. So, we concluded that we needed to have another conversation to really clear the air a little better, which I agreed to and was fine with, but told them that I was really busy with school and work for the next month. They got mad at me for letting them know I was busy for a month, when they had just ghosted me for a month. I was just letting them know that I was busy, and they told me that they must not be a priority to me. After they ignored me for a month. OK. Sort of just left it t that and we stopped talking for a like a week.

So, I unfortunately trusted Tom’s intentions to want to be friends a little too much. We had been getting lunch here or there to update each other on our lives, and one night he invited me over and said that a couple of our mutuals might be there. In retrospect, I shouldn’t have gone. I have attachment issues though and didn’t want him out of my life completely. I got there and the mutuals didn’t end up coming. Tom bought tequila, which is my hoe drink, and he knows it. Being careless I got drunk, and it was a good time for a while, until I kissed him. I stopped myself immediately and said that I didn’t want that. He asked why and that was the last thing that I remember. Now if we were both totally trashed, it would have been one of those “it is what it is” incidents. But apparently, I called my Greg and John crying asking them to come pick me up because I was in an uncomfortable situation. Well, they showed up and came in, greeted Zac and then took me home. I don’t remember having sex with him, but after a while I know that we did. I could feel it. At first, I was like oh I’m dumb, but then my friends told me that he was not that drunk. After they told me that I felt very taken advantage of. I’m not usually one to say being drunk is an excuse, but I was blackout incoherent drunk. My friends told me it took a solid 2 hours until they could get anything coherent out of me and I was just crying the whole time. The gentlemanly thing to do in that situation was to put me to bed and separate himself from the situation. But he didn’t. Part of me doesn’t want to believe he planned the evening to end up just as it did, but a larger part of me doesn’t trust his intentions at all. I know I’m not totally innocent in that situation, though. When I tried to tell him how I felt, not just putting all the blame on him, all he did was get super defensive and mad. Didn’t even apologize. Just said I was being unfair.

After Greg and John came to my rescue, I was grateful, but when I got home, I realized that it is time for our friendship to fade out. In retrospect I’ve realized that this happens all the time with them. It isn’t that hard to maintain a friendship, all it takes is an occasional “miss you” text. It’s always me reaching out to them. Only energy comes from me, the only reason we would ever hang out was because I would reach out to them, well I’m done. I’m tired of being the person that puts in all the effort, and I plan to cut out every relationship in my life I have like.

Anyway, that was a month ago. I have essentially cut contact with all of them. Only contact Tom to finalize our loose ends.

I don’t know what I’m doing by posting this other than maybe getting it all out in text for therapeutic reasons? This year has been the hardest of my fucking life. I feel hopeless most days and am on a constant grief rollercoaster.

I miss my dad. I miss my best friend. I miss not feeling incredibly alone. Having attachment issues and cutting people off is incredibly hard. I want to continue to let them walk all over me just for the sake of not being alone. I refuse to let myself though. I know that I was not perfect in any of these scenarios, and I made mistakes with how I handled many things, but it doesn’t change the realization I have had about my worth.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] effort. I am [REDACTED_NAME] checking up on while going through MANY traumatic things. I deserve a love that doesn’t have to be told how to treat me. I deserve friends who don’t treat me as a convenience. I am [REDACTED_NAME] very hard with loneliness. I feel I have lost everything. I feel friendless, loveless, and just… alone. I have my family, but blood relations are different that the people you chose to surround yourself with. I’m not saying I don’t love my family, but they don’t fill the same kind of loneliness I have been left with.

Anyway, thanks for reading my story.

Hope you all are making it through your own struggles despite how hard it might be.

(PS- I realize how specific this situation is, but at this point I don’t really care who see’s what and what truth they get from it. I am [REDACTED_NAME], and I guess this is the one way I feel I can get it all off of my chest.)",8
1eb5d2p,1721837495.0,2024-07-24 16:11:35,TrueOffMyChest,I hated my parents because they sold their bodies and souls so I could enter a top school and years later I realize how worth it it was,"Im from a very poor and small third world country. My parents were both young when they had me and worked hard to afford a small house.  We lived there until I was 10 (4th grade) and I went to a public school 5 mins away walking. 

When I was 11 and supposed to enter 5th grade, shit started to get weird. They sold the house and we rented a room where the 3 of us lived. My dad started working two jobs and my mom started working longer hours as a domestic worker. 
The new school they enrolled me in, was so different I had a hard time adjusting. It screamed money everywhere, they gave us all laptops and ipads stuff I’d never touched in my life. 

At home we were so fucking poor most of the time my only meal for the day would be rice with eggs, and whatever they gave me at school. 

I didn’t understand what was going on  and resented my parents for putting us through that shit so i could go to a ‘better school’. But as the years passed I adapted and started making friends. 

As kids you don’t truly care about who the parents of your friends are, so every time they invited me to vacation with everything paid I was just happy. My parents usually were invited but only my mom could go. 

Only now I realize that it was me that allowed my parents to get close to all that important people. My mom became a close friend of my best friend’s and slowly our situation became better. My dad got in another business with them and my mom also started her own thanks to all the contacts I made in school. My group friend consisted of maria ( daughter of the top producers of rice and noodles), ricardo (the son of the richest doctor in the country), and lucia (the daughter of the biggest car seller lmao). 

Now I’m studying abroad with all the commodities I could only dream of when I was a child. We suffered a lot, and were judged even more but in the end it all paid off. ",5540
1h3vvlh,1733029775.0,2024-12-01 05:09:35,TrueOffMyChest,This single gal definitely made me realize why she’s single ," I was introduced to a girl by a friend. I got her number and picked her up from the airport to take her to a friend’s wedding. She seemed nice, and the weekend went well.

I sent her a message, and she responded. Then I wished her a Happy Thanksgiving. Somehow, two messages over the course of a week were “too much.”

What really irritated me was when she had her friend tell me to leave her alone.

All I said was, “Happy Thanksgiving,” to which she responded, “Thank you so much! I hope you had a great day.” I simply asked how her day was after that.

Long story short, this whole situation made me shake my head and think, Now I know why she’s single.

Edit: 

(I only say that because my friend told me she’s never had a boyfriend and we actually talked about that). 

Also, I was the photographer, so I wasn’t really as sociable with her due to being busy during the wedding. ",2725
zd8ryx,1670251766.0,2022-12-05 14:49:26,TrueOffMyChest,Gf being under anesthesia made me realize how lucky I am,"I (m23) never got taken seriously by women. I always ended up getting friend-zoned or got told “it's not you it's me”. I never thought I was ugly but being rejected did make me feel less attractive.  I feel like I have relatively nice facial features. I'm a chubbier guy, not obese or anything just got a bit of a dad bod going on. 

My girlfriend (f22) is so beautiful both inside and out she is honestly out of my league. We have been dating for a little over a year. She compliments me , I honestly sometimes feel like she’s just being nice and doesn’t truly feel that way even though it’s been over a year. 

Yesterday she had a surgery, it was 4 hours long and she got put under some pretty strong anesthesia. When gf was awake and I got to see her, she seen me and said, it’s my beautiful boyfriend and had a huge smile on her face. The nurse told me gf been taking about me since she first woke up. Then a little while later She was just staring at me with the cutest smile.I asked what are you thinking about, she said just appreciating how gorgeous you are. Throughout the day she would randomly say “I love you” or “you’re so handsome”. 

She doesn’t remember anything. I think this helped me realize that my gf does find me attractive which makes me feel so happy.",9270
10ayyib,1673627919.0,2023-01-13 16:38:39,TrueOffMyChest,I (25M) am afraid my discontinuation of the any sort of relationship with my mother (45F) will ultimately end in her suicide.,"Hello, everyone. I (25M) am at a loss for words after this recent holiday season, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if I should continue contact with my mother (45F). This will be a long one, so strap in, but I believe all the context I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to provide is relevant.

I was born out of wedlock to two 20 year old parents. Shortly after I was born, they broke up due to my father being violent and verbally abusive to my mother. For the duration of my adolescence, I lived with my mother and my father would make biweekly visits to see me and my half brother (same dad, different mom).

My mother dropped out of community college when she became pregnant with me. After I was born, she suffered severe post-partum depression which exacerbated a life long anxiety affliction. I don't believe I've ever seen her free of anxiety or depression since I've been alive. She managed to hold down several behavioral health jobs until I got to highschool, but never cleared more than $20k a year when she acted as head of household. She never remarried, and only had one significant romantic relationship that she ended around the time she got diagnosed with extreme liver failure when I was 7 years old.

Up until that age, I remember my mother mostly fondly. She would read to me often, and was the one who encouraged me to read on my own -- a habit I maintain today which I still attribute to her. I strongly recall the near constant tones of love in her voice, and those memories tug at my heartstrings very much now. I only seem to remember a few cracks of dysfunction showing through in my childhood: most of her free time was devoted to sleep, and all throughout elementary and middle school she would drop me off late to school or be late to pick me up nearly everyday. One morning, I got out of our bed to answer a knock at our door. It was two police officers with a warrant for her arrest for fighting with a coworker. There are a few long stays I remember taking with my aunt (father's sister) when I was very young -- I know now that was due to my mother being out of her mind on xanax and forgetting to retrieve me after a few days. Due to financial reasons, we stopped celebrating birthdays and Christmases when I was around 10 years old. Around this time, I vaguely remember my mother breaking down out of the blue one day, crying and admitting to me she had been using my dad's child support to buy herself clothes and furniture and likely cigarettes, and hadn't used much on me for some time. When I bring this up presently, she denies it.

Our relationship took a steep nosedive when I was in middle school, and has plummeted further still with no signs of recovery. Of course, I can only say so much about my attitude towards her as a hormonal middle schooler who desperately wanted friends but had no figure in life to model friendships after, as my mother never had many close friends. I distinctly remember getting invited over to a baseball friend's house and being in awe of the dynamic between parent and child -- snacks, fully cooked meals eaten at a dinner table together, toy rooms, allowances, movie and game nights, professional photos of the entire family hanging on the walls. Environments of love and support and -- which I'm [REDACTED_NAME] realizing now -- ultimately empowerment to become a fully fledged person with aspirations and desires, to hone empathy and relationships, and acquire a sense of accountability not only beholden to oneself. I only state these things to explain my feelings of deficiency towards my relationship with my mother.

So, all throughout middle school our relationship was defined by conflict. Arguments, screaming matches, her lambasting me for trying to act like her father and always wanting to argue, disrespecting her constantly, etc. This seemingly sudden shift from a sweet, loving, supportive mother to a volatile and nearly entirely combative mother instilled a deep sense of resentment in me that hasn't altogether left. Perhaps even grown.

When I was a freshman in high school, I developed a relationship with my first girlfriend. She and her parents had recently moved from Florida, built a large house on a nicely sized plot of land, and as such were disproportionately wealthy compared to anyone I'd ever known. They were the traditional conservative Christian type, with my girlfriend's father being the sole income winner and her mother being the sweet stay-at-home mom. After spending much time with them, and talking intimately with my girlfriend about her life, her relationship with both her parents, and about the things constantly on the forefront of my mind that she never had to worry about -- I felt deeply dissatisfied with the life my own parents had afforded me, and began to hold it against them. Although never overtly or disrespectfully.

When I would vocalize these things to my mother, she would disparage my girlfriend's family saying things like ""they only look happy from the outside"" and ""you don't know what skeletons they have in their closet"" and ""I've done everything for you, you are always so ungrateful"". My girlfriend's parents invited my mother over for dinner one time, and my mom took them up generously on their offer of wine. Before the night was over she had cried while they consoled her, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure of the details of their conversation. I remember feeling immensely guilty and sorry for my mother, for her to have finally seen with her eyes the impossible standard I had begun to hold her against.

By the time I was a sophomore in high school, my mother had held a job for 7 years working in-house with a mentally-retarded client. In this job she made $10/hr and worked 32 hours a week. In the latter half of the year, she decided to not attend a mandatory training and was promptly fired. There had been some drama prior to this, so I think the training was just the straw that broke the camel's back. Shortly after she was fired, I (mostly due to the encouragement of my girlfriend's father) began my first job at a fast food pizza joint. I made minimum wage ($7.25/hr) and averaged about 35 hours a week there for the remainder of the school year, and my mother took the odd job here and there cleaning houses. The rest of her time was spent existing on the living room couch, sleeping or browsing the internet. Before I knew it, she was asking me for money. At first it was for small things, cigarettes, soda... then the power bill and water bill. We needed rent money, money that I didn't have, so that summer I asked my manager to increase my hours. For the entire summer, I worked 50-60 hours a week. Thanks to a personal finance class, I was budgeting handsomely, but at the end of every month I never had more than a few $20s left over. Good thing we were at least making rent.

Into my junior year, I begrudgingly maintained a 40-50hr work week at the pizza shop while going to school and working out in the mornings. My mother quickly stopped looking for jobs, despite my increasingly frustrated insistence. Here's how the months went by: I would wake up at 5:30am to go for a run, mom would be asleep on the couch. I'd get back, go work out at the YMCA, return home and shower for school, mom would be asleep on the couch. School's out, home by 3:30, work at 4pm. Mom awake, lying on the couch. I was a closer every night, so I didn't get home until 10:30-11pm. Mom on the couch. Homework to do. Laundry piling up, dishes in the sink. My only day off was Sunday, so that day was for attempting to maintain a home. We'd fight every time we talked. My diet consisted of school lunch and incorrectly assembled pizzas.

One day, I return home from school to find an eviction notice posted on our door. We have an outstanding balance of $4,000; our rent was $550/month. How is this possible? Huge blowout with mom. She says she's entitled to live a comfortable life, so she spent my rent money on accessories, soda, cigarettes, and Xanax she was buying from a friend. I'm [REDACTED_NAME], and far beyond my ability to articulate my feelings or even grasp the situation. Our landlords had had it with us, although they gave us a 60-day notice instead of a 30-day one. I was gearing up to take the ACT in a few weeks; if I got a good enough score, I could go to a state school for free. I couldn't spend the time necessary to find us another home, so I suggested we may have to live in the projects. Mom indignant, ""that's not for us, no way in hell I'd live there.""

Surprisingly, we found a comparable house to rent across the street. Mom had two months to pack up our things, while I was doing all that I was doing. A week before our eviction date, I came home to mom painting her nails in the bathroom, on the phone with a friend. A few boxes packed, but the entire house a mess. I barged into the bathroom demanding her to get off the phone and help me clean and pack. An argument ensued, an ugly yelling match. She went to grab her keys to go for one of her drives, which usually meant she wouldn't be back for an hour or two. I got to the keys first and told her no, we have work to do. I remember her yelling so hard, the veins in her forehead were popping and her eyes became bloodshot, bulging. It's the worst memory I have of her, and unfortunately it's one of the strongest. She shoved me back, I took a step forward. She slapped me closed fist across the face. Hard. It wasn't the first time she'd hit me, but it was the first time it really hurt. I gave her the keys and she left.

Somehow, we managed to move everything across the street -- with the help of my dad. For my senior year of high school, my mother and I resumed our routine. I began waiting tables, which afforded me more take home money and only required five days of my week, with the trade-off being longer hours. Mom had a few stints working in factories, but they never lasted more than a week. Twice that year, she was admitted to an inpatient facility for Xanax dependence. The weeks I was alone at home were the most peaceful I'd had in a long time. I took the ACT that year twice, and I remember getting into a really heated argument early in the morning the night before my final one. Despite it all, I scored well enough for a full ride to state school. In my journal entries at the time, I noted: ""If she doesn't work with me on fixing our relationship, I might never come back. What kind of son would that make me?""

I would like to say I'm [REDACTED_NAME] done. If you've made it this far, I can only express my utmost gratitude.

I attended a state college for an engineering degree. I'd saved up enough money the summer prior from a fire hydrant painting job that I didn't have to work my freshman year. I wanted to focus on my grades. I'd return home nearly every weekend to see mom and friends. She'd often ask for a little bit of money, and I had a good chunk saved up, so I would give her a $20 when I saw her.

When I returned home for Christmas break, I only had $200 to my name. My plan was to wait tables at my old restaurant for two weeks, with the hope I could make it through another semester. As soon as I got home, mom asked for $70 for the water bill. The following day I knew I had an eye appointment, and contacts would cost me $100. I told her no, I didn't have enough money. She said she knew I had money, and threatened to take away my school laptop. I said go ahead. She was in a state that cycled between rage and crying, and she eventually broke down and said fuck it, nothing matters anymore. The way she said it, I knew she meant to kill herself. I had my first shift back at the restaurant in half an hour, and they were gracious to offer me a two-week position so I didn't want to appear ungrateful. When I walked out the door, mom had a pill bottle in her hands. I got down the street and realized I'd never be able to live with myself if I could have intervened. I called into work, and I couldn't outright say my mother was threatening to kill herself to the manager... so I got chewed out pretty good. I went and paid the water bill, and picked up a pizza and two liter of soda so mom and I could break bread and talk everything out. When I returned with the food, she was asleep on the couch, still alive. She asked me sarcastically where I got the money for the pizza when I couldn't pay the water bill. I told her it was paid, and we needed to talk. She was very reticent and passive aggressive, and of course everything devolved into an argument. She claimed I never loved her, which made me so mad I shattered a plate on the floor and went to walk out. She begged me not to go, cut her feet up on the glass. When I was out the door, I heard her say, ""Oh, I'll show you a real mess. I'll just grab one of these shards and slit my wrists! Would you like th--"". Again, up the street with my car idling. I went back and swept up the glass and she hit me. After that, I stayed with my roommate from college and his uncle in their tiny apartment. I'd drive by our house everyday after work, wondering if my mom's decaying corpse was on the couch. I'd been gone a week before getting the flu. His uncle was immuno-compromised and I had nowhere else to stay and work. So, I went back home to find my mom on the couch. Sleeping. Alive and certainly not well.

For the remainder of my freshman year, I scraped by and didn't return home on the weekends any longer. I didn't know if my mother was employed, or if the bills were getting paid. With the summer approaching, and the terrifying prospect of returning home looming over me, I asked my dad's sister (who lived in Colorado) if I could spend a summer with her. She was so excited to have me, and thus my plans for the summer were set.

I communicated these plans to my mom around a month before I was to leave. As always, she was jealous of the time I spent with my dad's family, but also excited for me to spend some time in another state. Three days before I was to leave, she informed me she was getting evicted from our house, and that I needed to stay and help her move everything. I was so mad at the lack of foresight she'd given me that I ignored her and left without saying so much as goodbye. I spent a wonderful summer in Colorado, and returned to college with more money than I'd saved up the summer prior. I got back in contact with my mom, who held a deep grudge against me for leaving her with all of our things to move out on her own. She'd moved back in with her parents -- kind, simple people who live in slight squalor in their very small home. She expressed how much she hated it there, and I listened, trying to be sympathetic. She'd begun working part time at a cigarette store.

We maintained this way throughout the rest of my undergrad. I'd come down for Thanksgiving and Easter to see her, but she'd never drive to my college town to see the life I'd made for myself. She'd hardly even ask about me and our relationship only existed due to the fact she grew me in her belly. One holiday, we got into a screaming match because she said it was my own choice to work so much through high school, that I never had to work at all. I'd spend the summers in Colorado, and was beginning to fall in love with the state and culture.

My senior year, I got into only my second long-term relationship with a really wonderful woman. My plan was always to move to Colorado after I'd graduated, and we began our relationship in acknowledgement of those plans. She met my mother once during Thanksgiving, and my mother didn't take too kindly to her. So, I didn't see much of my mom my senior year.

The pandemic hit in the spring semester, which threw everything in the air. I stayed a few months longer than I'd planned after graduating with my degree, notably the final month living with my girlfriend. It was quite idyllic. A few weeks before I planned to leave for Colorado, I told my mom I'd like to see her before I left. She agreed, and I planned to drive down to my hometown the weekend before I left. The day before I was going to see her, mom texted me saying she'd been exposed to COVID. Pretty heartbroken, I told her I wouldn't be able to see her in person, but to please call me soon. She didn't respond. The day I was leaving for Colorado, I had the most heartfelt goodbye with my girlfriend -- a feeling of loss I hadn't felt since my brother died filled me. I began to think I was making a mistake, but I was steadfast to my commitment to Colorado. A few hours on the road, I received a long text from my mom. She expressed how disappointed in me she'd become, how I never showed her anything but disrespect, how she'd raised me better than to abandon my mother, etc. All this really heavy bullshit that could have been avoided with a phone call and that I really didn't need at the time. She said she was cutting me out of her life, just like she'd done with her sister and aunt (people that had financially helped her until it became enabling). I just said okay, told her I loved her, and continued my drive away from one woman I'd loved with all my heart and another who was systematically breaking down our relationship with every chance she got.

My ex-girlfriend visited me in Colorado a few months later, and it was clear she'd lost much of the love she'd had for me. This realization took several weeks and I allowed my mental processes to really fuck me up. I had no friends, lived with my aunt and her boyfriend who worked 10hr+ days from home, and I was beginning to realize the coping mechanisms I'd developed against early trauma weren't coping mechanisms at all. I'd been numbing a lot of pain with marijuana, which only increased in Colorado -- also which I partially blamed myself for making me unworthy of my ex's love at the end of our relationship -- so I quit cold turkey and wrote down all of my thoughts. The job prospects in the city I was living in in Colorado were seemingly slim-to-none, the pandemic was raging, and I had no social support network for the first time in my life I ever felt like I really needed one. So, after a few cold, terribly lonely months, I convinced myself I had ultimately made a mistake by leaving the only friends I'd ever really known. I made the decision to return to my college town to reconcile with my ex-gf under the guise of better employment prospects. My birthday passed during this time, and I awoke on the day to see $1,000 deposited in my bank account, which I desperately needed. It was my mom. I called her and thanked her and told her the whole situation about my life at the moment... and she was sympathetic -- but only to a point. She would listen to me for a few minutes and then go off on a tangent about some cop she liked and how it related to my two-year relationship. I began to realize she'd never known the kind of romantic love I was suffering withdrawals from. But I was ultimately thankful to have her back in my life -- because it was the lowest point in my life, I needed my mom, and would take her in whatever capacity she could give.

I returned back to my college town, and stayed with my old roommate in his incredibly tiny apartment until I could find a job. I contracted COVID the day before Christmas, had an isolated Christmas and New Year, and I badgered my poor ex-gf to death about meeting up and talking so much so that she went no-contact with me. It was the lowest point in my life -- I was so incredibly distraught.

Thankfully, soon I was offered an engineering job, making more money than I'd ever dreamed. I got my own apartment, but couldn't allow myself to fully enjoy it because I didn't really feel like a real, tangible person at the time. Now, two years on, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] just getting that feeling back.

In the midst of this turmoil in my own life, my mother had been living at her parents for 5 years and was becoming increasingly depressed and restless. She reconciled with her sister, and moved in with her. I went to see her a few months after I'd returned home. Keep in mind I hadn't seen her in about 1.5 years at this time, and I was in the darkest spot of my life. She knew that. I met her as she was closing her store. She seemed frustrated that I dropped in without letting her know, wouldn't hug me due to believing she had a skin disease (Morgellan's I believe), and for the first 20 minutes I saw her she bitched and griped about workplace drama. She didn't ask me how I was doing, how I felt after graduating college, if I was disappointed in not being able to find work in Colorado, nor how I was feeling about the breakup. All in all, in no way was she there for me.

That really hurt me, and I didn't talk to her for a good while. Now, we're in Spring 2022. It's been an incredibly lonely and honestly devastating two years for me socially, with the only consolation being my financial security. One morning I wake up to several missed phonecalls from my mother. She'd fallen and broken her shoulder in the night. For context, the week prior my aunt (her sister) had been in the process of evicting her for not paying rent. So now she's unable to work, her sister's breathing down her neck, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in my dark night of the soul -- but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] good money. So, what does any good son do in my shoes? I throw money at her. I take her to her doctor's appointments, pay for her meds, buy her groceries, give her gas money, pay for car maintenance, etc. If I'm [REDACTED_NAME] such a place in my life where I can't help myself, I guess I'll help my mother.

Over the course of last year, I gave her around $6,000 while she recovered from her injury. I bought her books and clothes that she mentioned in passing, to surprise her and make her feel valued. She lost her job, then got it back. Things look up and then look down and then....

In November of this year, I began talking to a girl. To keep this brief (we're really almost done), I was able to relate to her the depth of my hurt and loneliness, and she told me hers. We promised to be there for one another in the next year, because my initial plan was to ""pull myself up by my bootstraps"" and get my life on track through sheer force of will. This girl said that wasn't a healthy thing to do, and said she'd be there for me to encourage me. Her presence empowered me to make changes for the better in my own life, and I was feeling significantly less depressed from having someone to go through life alongside me. A week before Christmas, she breaks things off and goes back to a guy she said multiple times she never had any feelings for. I returned her presents and tore up a sketch she asked me to do of her. So it goes.

All that to say, Christmas was approaching and I was heartbroken and painfully lonely once more. I decided to go down to my hometown and spend Christmas with my mother, her sister, and their family. Something I hadn't done in more than a decade. I told my mom this a week prior; she seemed very excited. I bought her some presents, books and clothing, and hoped to enjoy a good Christmas with family. I'd also given her $400 the week prior, because she wasn't getting many hours at work.

When I was driving down, my mother texted me and told me she hadn't been feeling very well all week and she thought she had the stomach flu, but made sure I was still going to come. Would have been a good thing to mention prior, but I understand her want to see me for the holidays. When I arrived, my mother was in her room in bed. The room was a mess and stank. She sat up in bed and told me she felt like shit. I told her ""Merry Christmas"" and followed her outside so she could smoke. Again, she immediately complained to me about all the drama at work. I listened, but it didn't matter whether I did or not because I began counting the minutes in my head and she didn't notice. Again, she didn't ask a thing about me or my life or if I was happy or why I was sad. We went inside and sat down, and she got into an argument with her sister. I was nearly on the verge of tears and very anxious. But no one took notice. Soon, my aunt's daughters and their children arrived with many presents and much loudness and bustle. I have a 12 year old cousin who I haven't seen in a few years, and she's always been my good buddy on holidays. As soon as she walked in, she looked at me and called me ugly. I get it, she's almost a teenager, but it wasn't quite what I was hoping to hear on Christmas Day. And so everyone gathers around, on their phones, making disparaging remarks to eachother -- it just felt like nothing I wanted from family on Christmas; there wasn't any feeling of love or true celebration.

Time to open presents! I give my mom hers, which weren't wrapped and she thanks me. And then she gets some more from others, everyone's passing them around. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on the couch, twiddling my thumbs. I watched the entire family open presents without me. What a feeling I never hoped to experience. My mom's stomach is upset, so I offer to go grab her some gingerale -- just for an excuse to be alone in the car and cry a bit. When I come back, she's in her room. And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about to get the hell out of there. I was being very curt with her, and eventually she notices. ""What's wrong?"" She asked. I told her. I went on and on and on, keeping my voice fairly level and calm. At the end of it, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] at her. And she says, ""well, I didn't expect you to get me any presents."" I stormed out. I got in my car. And she came out to smoke. I went to talk to her, because I know she's also in a dark place and I don't want to leave her on a bad note on the off chance she really will off herself soon. We talk for a bit, and I tell her she's not helping me at all. That she's actively hurting me. And of course, these big crocodile tears well up in her eyes, she says she's tried her best to be a good mother to me, yada yada. And I felt bad for her. Genuinely, truly I did and do. She told me I don't come down to see her enough. I expressed my frustration at the fact I've lived an hour away for nearly seven years and not once has she come up to see me in my life. She says her anxiety is too bad to drive on the interstate. Always an excuse for thee, not for me.

I feel she's in a cage of only somewhat her own making. That it's not necessarily her fault that her mental illness has led her to being a 45 year old woman with nothing to show for it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only son, she admitted she had two abortions after me. I have a feeling that if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] there for her, no one else will be. And again, the question is begged: what kind of son would that make me? But I do have to admit, she's never apologized for anything. When I bring up how confusing my adolescent experience was, she says it was never her fault and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to pin the blame on her. She says I deserved to get hit when she hit me, because I was disrespecting her. That I never had to sacrifice so much of my social life in high school to ensure we had a roof over our heads.

She called me the other day, and told me she'd once again lost her job. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] exasperated at this point. Initially, when she needed help after she injured her shoulder, I told myself I'd only give back the $1,000 she gave me when I was in Colorado. I exceeded that by $5,000. I can't bring myself to give her anymore, to fund her increasingly depressing lifestyle. Though I know she'll ask.

So here I am, 25 years old and finally in a secure enough place to realize how deficient I've become as a person -- a lot of the fault for that I do place on my mother. How is she to know the full extent of what she couldn't give me if she doesn't know a better life exists at all? I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to grow in so many ways, to hopefully be a father myself one day. To be a genuinely good friend to the people in my life. Most importantly, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to be good to myself.

I haven't texted her in a week, because I don't know what to do. I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] beyond a point where it would be acceptable to cut her out of my life entirely. I know I can't fix her problems, despite my best efforts, and I could continue to throw money at her for the rest of her life. I think the thing that frightens me the most is -- the rest of her life could very well be contingent on me continuing to help her. She's admitted to me multiple times in various phonecalls that she often thinks of killing herself. But she's just to chickenshit to go through with it. She's also said I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only thing that makes her life worth living, despite me not really even liking her as a person. I don't think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] enough at this point in my life to completely disregard the past in hopes of a better relationship. I don't know what a better relationship would look like, I don't enjoy or even hardly see my mom as her own person.

So, people of reddit, I thank you endlessly if you've taken the time out of your day to read my story. The question is: do I cut my mom out of my life, fully acknowledging the chance it would encourage her suicide -- or do I continue in vain trying to develop a relationship with her that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] even sure I want?

Thank you.

**tl;dr: My mother has always suffered from anxiety and depression. I supported us financially in highschool, but resent her for not taking any accountability for the sacrifices I made and continue to make. She's at a terrible place in her own life, and hasn't ever been able to be there for me. I've been financially assisting her these last couple of years, and she didn't think to show any appreciation for me this Christmas -- when I needed it the most. Do I cut her out entirely or continue trying to build a relationship that has never been there?**",10
15zu5yb,1692860281.0,2023-08-24 06:58:01,TrueOffMyChest,I am the reason why my father and uncle got into a fight,"Okay so before telling you my story, i (16m) )use my self for my bad language, english is not my native language and i am [REDACTED_NAME] using any translater, so sorry for any grammar mistake.

Okay this is one of my darkest secret i think i will bring with me in my future grave, lit's the first time i tell somebody this story.   


A little background, My Mother's brother John (fake names for privacy reason) has married Mia. Mia is one of the most cruel, horrible and fake person i've ever met in my life. when she met my family, she planned to turn John to hate us and seprate him to all my family (granfather and grandmother also). John has never been mentally strong, so he didn't make resistence and listened to all the bullshit Mia said.   


Mia was very abusive typwith me, i really think she was jealous because i was smarter, stronger and nicer to my grandpas than his son, and every time that was possible she would put hands on my mouth to shut me up, or to kick me or hurt me. I tried to talk with my parents but she corrupted me to gain my silence, and i was just a kid (8/9 years old) so nobody really believed me. 

The last straw was when i was playing with my friends at the ps3 system, and Mia was taking a coffee with my mother. I don't really remember, i said womething in the ear of my friend because something in the game happened and we started laughing loud. The next day, she invited me to her house (just to let you know, we live all in the same building, one house for my grandpas, one house for us and one house for them), and she made me sit on her chair. Then, he started accusing me and she said i insulted her when it was not true. I felt betrayed and i started crying, and after 2 hours of crying at her chair begging her to stop she gave me a slap.   


I am a resentful person, so when i got back home i said nothing and i faked a smile and pretended i got hurt on the soccer field. Then, i started to do every thing possible to make their life hell. At first it was nothing really serious, i was just putting piece of paper with ""fuck you"" typed in their mailbox, but when i got older (12 years old) i started doing really bad things. I faked an audio where my uncle John pretended to call my mother a B to trigger my father, then i Hacked Mia's laptop to try to activate a sound alert in the middle of the night. Then i hacked her facebook and posted something bad about my family, to make them angry and to cut off any contact with them.   


I have always been a great kid with technology since i was a newborn, so i used that to my advantage.   


The last straw for them was when i pierced all the four tires of their car, and then John came rang the our house's bell to redeem some money. My father is a gorgeous man, he trains and is really muscled, so he at first started laughing to John's request, because he had such an acute voice and was short and overwight, but John continued and pushed my dad. When my dad loses the patience, it's over for everybody, so he first called me to ask if i have ever done something like this. I lied and I said i didn't know anything and that i love John and Mia. So my dad went to the kitchen and grabbed me an icecream, he told me to go to my room and close the door, and i did it. I have seen John two weeks later and he didn't even talk to me, and i didn't either. Just some months after i realized that my dad got into a fight with him and won.

I feel really, really bad from one side, but from the other side i think they deserved it. In the end, i achieved my goal to separate them from my family, because also if we are neighbors, we don't ever look at each other in the face and don't talk since the incident. It's been 4 years and everything it's still so quiet and dead. 

 I am [REDACTED_NAME] nobody loves anymore john and mia, but at the same time i am [REDACTED_NAME] because my granpas ""lost"" a son and their grandchild. But hey, they deserved it, or at least i think, don't they?

125sodu,1680106459.0,2023-03-29 16:14:19,TrueOffMyChest,Lost girl,"Today 2023 I am 4 years into my recovery. I spent a lot of time covering and burying these feelings of neglect, hurt, loneliness, and hate for myself. I was addicted to crack/cocaine, I did cocaine before crack and almost hated it, it gave me the worst sinus infection and I eventually switched to meth. I was that kind of addict that could have died from the lifestyle alone. I traded my morals, self respect and care for anything I ever loved for one more hit. I failed rehab 3 times and did a little time in county. I was the only girl in county jail with the charge ""prostitution."" I look back now and I realize that the rehab time and all that bull shit was not for me to get better, if we are being honest if I recall one of the only reasons I went was to get out of the cold or because I had nowhere else to go. I wanted to get better but I knew deep down that I wasn't done with drugs, I admit everytime I walked into those doors of treatment my heart was not 100% on stopping drugs. I did try a few times to figure out why I turned to drugs and what was my deep core issue that I was covering up. This story explains finally why I am [REDACTED_NAME] way I am. Why I slept with over 20 guys by the time I was 15, including a married man. Now you can say what you want about me but I believe I was looking for love and affection. My innocence was taken from me at a very very young age and the influence I grew up around was not ideal for a kid. My mom and dad were young when they had me and now I know they got married because mom got pregnant, I think she was 19. My dad drank ALOT and he could get mentally, emotionally and physically abusive, if he got enough in him or drank whiskey.  Dad has a big heart and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only daughter, he is kind, generous, and a good dad. 

I took a lot of time in rehab to try to uncover my issues and try to heal but I got scared and ran every time. This time was different. In 2019 I was left by a guy I depended on, we were both homeless and my stuff was in his truck. One night he decided he wasn't gonna pick me up after work and it left me no choice but to do whatever I could to survive these streets. I needed to put my ducks in a row. By the time I realized he wasn't coming it was 10pm, I needed to find a bed, food, shower maybe, and more drugs to barter with. I ran the streets for almost 2 weeks alone with no help or someone to lean on. When I met Mel, I was looking rough, I had bruises all up and down my arms and legs, I was 90lbs, I haven't eaten in a day or two, and the best part I had the clothes on my back and maybe one more outfit in my bag. I had no underwear, one bra, like no socks, it was truly ridiculous. I lost everything I ever loved and owned 2ce over. I was Finally tired, finally just done. 

I met Mel in April of 2019, he was appalled when he realized how much I had lost and I still don't know what his true intentions were, maybe it was to help me or maybe it was to get in my pants, whatever it was I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it happened. I got clean with Mels love and support, no rehab, no NA or AA, I was done and I knew I had to stop or I was gonna die. 

These past 4 years I left state with Mel, we traveled for a bit and in this time I got to really think about what happened to me and why. It took some time for me to trust Mel and not think he was gonna leave in another state or somewhere stranded, he never did. I had nightmares, flashbacks, and bursts of anger for the first year. I really had to push through but I decided to write this story to maybe help someone that went through something similar. 

I was in a relationship with a 31 yr old when I was 12-13 years old.

A little back story: When I was growing up my dad was a carefree kind and just a free spirit. He was a functional alcoholic, he would get off work and drink anywhere from a half gallon to a whole gallon of vodka a night and get up at 6am and go to work. My mom and dad got divorced when I was young so I was passed back and forth but my dads was my favorite. I was allowed to do whatever I wanted and as a teenager I took advantage of that. Dad had a lot of friends and they drank too. Dad was close to his brother and he had a few real close friends who were around everyday of my childhood for as long as I can remember. The one in particular I will never forget. I was young, I mean like maybe 7-8 when (let's call him Jim) I met Jim. He was young, good looking and had been friends with dad from work. Jim and another one of dads friends lived together so they all started hanging out at my house. I had a friend over and she was a little older that day when Jim first came to my house. She was curious about him and I don't remember much about that day but I do recall Jim laying his head on her lap while she played with his hair. She gave him those flirty eyes and they sat there and talked. Remind you even though Jim was in his late 20s and my friend was maybe 12-13 at the time. Not long after I met Jim he got into some trouble and was sent to prison for a few years.

Fast Forward>>>>>

I was 11 when I found a letter from Jim to my dad. I wasn't sure if I was even allowed to read it but I opened it up and read it anyway. I will never forget the letters that formed the word ""tell wild child I said hi."" I don't know why I got curious, I actually don't even know what I was thinking. I spent days thinking of the letter, I guess I was lonely, I had to have felt some type of emptiness to write him back. I was 11 writing a grown ass man in prison for pulling out a gun on some guys who robbed him. Me and Jim talked about everything, he became my best friend really quick. I don't know why but I felt comfortable talking to him and telling him things that were happening with me, my friends, my boyfriend, and my family. He talked about his wife and 2 boys, he gave advice and was just very sweet, acted like he understood me and was very genuine. I now see as an adult he was manipulating me as a child but that little girl was craving for attention. We got to know each other, we talked all the way up to the day me and my dad and my friend were with us pulled up to the house after school and there Jim was sitting on our porch, just chilling. Thats when things got confusing and fucked up. I hate telling this story. It is so hard for me to realize what he was doing to me the whole time.. 

I don't really wanna get into the specifics. Um.. we Got close when he got out, He touched me multiple times, and also touched my friends. He gave me a ring at one point, Jim was 31 years old and I was 13 years old. It wasn't right and I hate that it went on as long as it did. He would kiss me when my dad wasn't around and tell me he loved me. Until the night it all ended. My friend came over while Jim was there I had a boyfriend over and supposedly Jim raped her when I wasnt in the room. There were hickeys on her neck and she was partying and drinking like a rockstar when I left her. I still have no idea what happened that night we even remained friends for a long time after and she never talked about it. I confessed to her that he was doing the same shit to me as he had been touching me for almost a year. She eventually did go to the police that night and she told them about me and everything that was happening. The police charged Jim with 2 counts of sexual imposition with a minor and 1 count rape he got 6 years. I always felt so guilty for sending him to prison, I hated that I had to tell I was ashamed of what he did to me but I was a child. When Jim had 6 months left in his sentence he killed himself in prison. I still don't know if that is true, how he died but I have had to go through years of trying to accept this in my past and live life to the fullest everyday without the reminder of what Jim did to me. I still can't tell you how it affected me, I guess it did in all kinds of ways and me wanting the attention in the first place makes me wonder. Growing up with my father letting me do whatever I wanted mainly because he only had my part time and I didnt think he ever wanted to be ""the bad guy"". He was more of a friend to me and when he drank too much it could turn bad quick. All of it is in the past and I have tried my whole life to forgive myself for my part in his death. I wanted to tell some of my story. it goes farther than this but i needed to get it out into the world.

I want to make this clear, my dad was an addict/alcoholic. He did the best he could with what he was given, even though he was asleep during this event and many others, he was clueless but now looking back as a recovering addict that it wasn't my dads fault. We trusted this man, he was a close family friend for many many years. We never thought that he would target 3 teenage girls. I thought the man really cared about me and I believed what he told me. 

Years later I changed schools my sophomore year and was in a small class with 2 girls and this geeky guy. (This was the year I found out Jim died) One of the girls, lets call her Ashley was telling our science teacher how her nephews dad was in prison and had just died, he was in the for 6 years for rape. She said that the girl lied and it was sad that her nephew had to lose his dad, she said that her Aunt Jims kids mom was distraught and in shock he could ever do the things he was accused of. I knew she was talking about me, I kept it to myself. What happened happened, I can't change a thing. 

This is me moving on and not being afraid to face any fear because I faced my biggest one. I will never stop healing but I can finally move on and let go. So Goodbye Jim.",2

\*\*\*TRIGGER WARNING: Detailed mentions of child abuse and sexual assault.\*\*\*

This account will be as objective as possible, telling my story as I remember it without exaggeration. As far as I remember, everything \*really\* started when I was 9 years old (I am [REDACTED_NAME], by the way). We moved around a lot, and I try to remember my age through events and where we lived, but I don't have the best recollection for that particular moment. I mean, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my own memory has distorted itself some because this really is not something people would want or even choose to remember. Honestly, I already know losing part of my memory would drive me crazy, but sometimes I wish I were one of those lucky people that could block out their memories.

I've made some poor decisions in my life, to include skipping class because I hadn't completed an assignment, and doing so little work in the seventh grade, that I had to do it all again. Only, this time, I would be sent back to live with my grandmother. She is a loving person, and the only reason I was sent to live with her was because I hated wearing uniforms in school, so going back to a school I hadn't been to since I finished the second grade was my punishment for the actions I regret while I was in school. If I had put even a little effort into school, my life would probably be several times better... But back to the important parts - I can rant about my failings to set up my future and my desires at some other time.

A little time had passed, since I had gone back to live with my grandmother, and two of my cousins had come to stay. We'll call them Jen (12f), and Andy (9f or 10f). I was 13 at this time. (I don't remember if they were just visiting, or if they had come back for school, too. They were moved around quite a bit like I was.) I know it had been at least a couple months because I had had my first boyfriend (Marty), gone through a breakup, and was with a second boyfriend (Art). For clarity, Marty and I didn't do anything but hang around each other all the time after we started dating, but we never even held hands. My grandmother worked at this Pre-K through eighth grade elementary school, and there was only one class' worth of students for each grade. Marty had broken up with me simply because he didn't want to get me into trouble, as the school was a small one where everybody knew everyone else, and word had already started to spread about us dating - which I was strictly not allowed to do at that age. A little while later, Art came along. All we did was hold hands when we walked around and pecked each other hello and goodbye and the beginning and end of the school days - nothing more.

My then stepfather, Uriel Antonio 'Tony' Juan Ramirez-Salazar (or any other combinations of this name, he has a couple 'unofficial' names due to his Mexican heritage but was going Tony Salazar last I saw), had been abusing me for some time now. Physical, mental, sexual - you name it, it happened. When I was away from home where he couldn't do anything, he would call once every day or every couple days. Even a state away, I couldn't be free of his perversion, and I just couldn't stay comfortable. He would ask gross things like ""Who is your husband? Who is your boyfriend? Who is your daddy?"" (and yes, he would say all those in the same call) expecting me to answer, ""You.""

After all this time, I finally had the gall to do something, anything, even if it was small. No one else was home, but e and my two cousins. I thought they might get a kick out of hearing how stupid the phone call with Tony was, if nothing else. However, once the phone call ended, Jen took a second to look at me and asked, ""Is your dad a molester?"" I had no words to confirm or deny anything. I just broke down crying. It was hard to come to terms with everything finally starting to happen, but my cousins were there comforting me, and that helped. With the two to back me up, I told my grandmother, and she called my mom in the state over. I don't remember at what point the police were called, but everything began to happen so quickly.

I was taken back home where my mom and Tony were to help in the investigation that were being conducted. I told the officers \*everything.\*

\- How he had been abusing me for years. I would do something he wouldn't like, and Tony was a big fan of corporal punishment. Sure, half of the time I was guilty, kids misbehave (especially if they don't trust adults to care for and protect them - big shocker), but the other half of the time, I did nothing wrong. Tony came into this marriage with 3 other kids (16f, 15f, and 8m) and 100% had the mindset of 'you're not my blood, so I won't treat you like my children deserve to be treated.' He never said that, but he never needed to for me to get it. I was always told ""no"" for everything I had to go to him to ask, too, so I always had my younger brother (the 8yo) ask him in my stead. It was mostly to play video games or go out and play, something like that. He would also make me look like a liar in front of my own mother. He would say things like ""turn off the TV, finish your food, etc."" Of course, I was a bit of a drama queen, so I would cry a bit which caused my mom to come over and ask what was wrong. When I told her, he would say things like, ""No, I said 'turn down the TV, you don't have to finish the food if you don't like it, etc.'"" saying that I just couldn't understand him because of his accent (native Mexican Spanish speaker, but knew conversational English well). He would also come after me for things he misplaced - his wallet/money, construction tools for home/work, and whatever else.

\- How the sexual abuse had started. Tony would often tell me that if my mother asked me to go to the store with her, to tell her no and stay home (I think there were other places, too, but I distinctly remember the times she went to the store). (And she still denies this to this day, saying that she would ""never leave me alone with a grown man,"" but maybe that's her way of blocking out her own memory and trying to convince herself she wasn't at fault in any part here.) He would take me into the closet in the master bedroom where he and my mom stayed and would play a weird ""game"" with me. He would put something over my eyes to blindfold me or just tell me to close my eyes so I couldn't see anything. The ""game"" was where he would put something in my mouth, which I was told would either be a carrot or a weenie/hot dog meat. If not one of those, he would put something disgusting in my mouth that would make me gag. (After a few times of this, I started to suspect what it was - his penis). I wouldn't guess at that, but I would ask what it was or say something about how gross or weird it tasted, and he would say something like it was the gum he was chewing around the hot dog or around his finger - which was not an option, by the way???

\- How it escalated. Eventually, he was like, alright you already know what it is, and I know you've figured it out. So he started making me perform oral sex on him. It was even worse because I have a sensitive gag reflex. It was so bad, I remember vomiting up ramen soup once, and once everything was out, he still made me keep going. Some time after that, he'd move on to rubbing his penis between my legs. It wasn't long until he had moved onto inserted himself in me and having vaginal sex. All of this was within the span of a year, so the rest of that time until I had said something would be him having vaginal sex with me. He also used it as his 'punishment' whenever I didn't do something he wanted or did anything I wanted without consulting him, all the while no one else in the family knew. He even made me listen in on him at the door of the master bedroom having sex with my mom once. (As if I didn't hear them enough times when I was sleeping in the room next to them, or the room next to that.) I became more petrified as time passed because I had started my period by the time I had reached age 12, and there was no form of contraception involved. I DID NOT want to become pregnant, and I was so scared because of the possibility. Thankfully, that sort of thing didn't happen.

She had also taken me to a doctor at some point - I don't really remember before or after which event, so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it in here. My own mother... had taken me to a specialist to get my hymen checked - to see if it was still there or not. We went back into the car, and I was nervous. My mother was furious, and she hadn't said anything to me just yet. Finally, she had told me that my hymen was still intact. To her, that meant I was still a virgin. To me, who didn't know anything either, that meant I was still a virgin. Upon hearing this news, something snapped inside me. I truly felt as if I was insane in that moment. I was questioning every aspect and every moment of my life then. Was I imagining everything in the past several years? Was my mind in a completely different space than my body was? Am I crazy? Where did the past few years of my life go? Where did these memories come from if they didn't really take place? Why is this happening to me? (I learned - maybe 3 years later when I was 16 - in my health class in summer school, two very distinct details I will never forget. 1 - Some people are actually born without hymens. 2 - Some people have what are called 'flexible' hymens, which means that they either break after multiple times, or could possibly never break. I was definitely very pissed when I found out about this, that I had been wronged by people - and a medical professional, no less - who didn't even know anything. Of course, I couldn't bring this up to my mother - the one person who was supposed to believe me but was so against me at the time I needed her most. How could I?)

What didn't help was my bit of excitement on the site about still dating Art, even though I had left. The 15f who was my sister (but she was a young girl from a broken family, so of course she wanted to try to find ways to defend her father) was the one I gushed to about it. Of course, she told my mother when this all broke out, and it made me look worse in the situation. I lied about it and denied it because I knew it wouldn't help to be truthful. Like it mattered anyway... Even when I was telling the truth, it was a lie...

Now, back to what was going on with Tony--

Unfortunately, although I had poured everything out to the investigators, they didn't have any physical evidence to use against Tony. He was already being held in prison/jail during this time, though, so I was thankful for that. I remember my mother being irate when she told me that Tony had been sent to the infirmary. I was a little scared because, of course, it was 'because of me' he had gotten beat up. I accused him of being what he was, and those people where he was didn't take too kindly to pedophiles, I suppose. Anyway, my mother was on the phone with him, telling me to talk to him, and to stop lying and to tell the truth (this from the person who always like to throw in my face the phrase ""the truth always comes out""; well, I guess it can go back in if you want to bury it so badly). So, Tony came up with this ruse while we were on the phone. He was telling me to just lie to the cops/detectives and to just say I did all this because I was jealous that my sister (his kid) had gotten so much attention for the quinceñera (Mexican/Hispanic culture sweet sixteen, but at 15) she had just had a few months back.

Side note, my mother also told me I needed to apologize to my grandmother and great-grandmother, who I was staying with when this all started. She said I needed to show that I was sorry for what I did and to explain why I did it to them. Of course, I never did. I never could. It was heartbreaking enough to have gone through all this, I couldn't lie about it more. I couldn't dig myself deeper into a hole of 'this never happened.' It did happen, and I couldn't figure out why I was the only one being punished. (I'll come back to this a bit later...)

So, that's what I did. I couldn't take anymore of no one finding evidence. I couldn't take anymore of feeling like my mother loved some man so much more than me that she would yell at me and fight with me to no end just to make it all stop. The one woman who was supposed to protect me, who should have believed me, was on his side... Honestly, I wished the cop that had spoken to me at the end would have fought a little more, but there probably wasn't anything else he COULD do. But he looked at me and asked if I was sure I wanted to take it all back. He said the details of my story were not like any story he had heard (mainly talking about that disgusting closet game), and that when they had called my cousins, they confirmed that the story I had told about the phone call with Tony saying that gross stuff to me was real. I just said that it was a joke we shared, and that I was just super creative, so I was able to come up with all those stories.

After that, he came back home. The investigation was over.Tony took me aside to be alone and begged me for forgiveness. He cried to me like he was the true victim in all this. Of course I didn't want to forgive him. I never have... But I knew if I didn't say what he wanted to hear that he wouldn't leave me alone. So I said I forgave him just to make him go away as quickly as I could.

The penetration had stopped, but he never ran out of ideas. After I took my showers, he would come to me and say that he needed to check to make sure I lotioned up my body well. He would even tell me that my mother had said this was okay or that she knew about it already - something to that effect. He would still touch me sensually all over my body, paying particular attention to the areas I wanted his attention the least. But what could I do? I had lost, and I felt I had no one that could \*or would\* save me from this. After several times of this, I finally broke down crying during one of those times. Again, he also began crying and trying to play the victim. However, I think he had become nervous that I might expose him again because he had finally stopped. I was either still 13 or had just turned 14, and it was finally over. Well, the physical part was...

Things I Learned About Tony's Past Long After...

\- Tony had a drug problem. Once he and my mom had my baby brother, who's 10 years younger than I am, Tony called him his ""little angel."" Because his son was his savior from drug use and abuse. (haha But apparently nothing could make him any less of a sick pig.)

\- Tony had already cheated on my mother (at least once from what I remember) with his ex-wife.

\- Tony had given my mother chlamydia (which really freaked me out because he could have given me that). However, when she told me it happened when I was a lot younger (than when everything with him happened), I felt a bit more relieved.

Tony's Aftermath...

Tony's job for as long as I had known him had been under-the-table construction work. So he went out of town quite a bit. When I was 15/16, my mother had discovered Tony had been cheating on her with some woman in a town about 4 hours away for 2 years. Interesting how the time lines up like that... There's also a bit of irony there because the entire time he was doing all that to me, he would constantly be yelling at home about her being late (she is still a workaholic who always works late) and that she's probably off cheating with some guy. Of course, everything blew up and they got a divorce.

The Aftermath with My Mother...

11 years. It took me 11 years after being shut down and thinking I had become psychotic to finally talk to my mother about this. I thought this would finally help with my mental health. Little did I know, it only became worse every time it happened.

I was home for a visit. I finally told her that everything that happened with Tony wasn't a lie, and that it actually happened. I kid you not, the words out of her mouth were, ""Oh, honey... You still think about that?""

I was stunned. She hugged me as I broke into tears, but I couldn't find anything in me to fight back or to say anything about it. Do I still think about that? The trauma over several years that was forced onto me? The trauma that I had to face \*alone\* for the majority of my life? Of course I still thought about it!

I was so angry when I went back home. I felt relieved to finally bring it up to her, but what she said and how she said it made me feel like she was dismissing the entire traumatic experience that I had to live through right under her nose. Dismissing that she left me to fend for myself against a predator who got away with everything and walked away without consequence. When I brought it up to her at home, she said she knew or she figured out over the years that it had happened because Tony kept bringing it up for some reason. (They were still in touch because my baby brother would go visit him every now and then. My mother was also the one who handled all the paperwork in the family. As a people-pleaser, I guess she still couldn't resist helping him with whatever paperwork and things he needed after everything Tony had done to her...)

She never reached out to apologize for doubting me or take accountability for not protecting me or taking my side like a parent should have. She never reached out to say I was right. She never reached out to apologize for the several times over the years that she would ask me ""why I did it"" or ""when was I going to apologize to my grandmothers..."" I guess when you're someone who always thinks you're right, even when you're wrong, you can't seem to admit when your at fault. But whatever, that's not my problem, I guess.

3 years later, still. Even after all that... I was still in turmoil. Why had my mother dismissed me? Why is she acting like I didn't go through something so terrible that it wouldn't leave a scar on my life. I was told I was a drama queen as a child, throwing tantrums at little things and what-not. Now, even as an adult, because of that, my emotions had never been taken seriously in my family. Every cry or outburst was seen as attention-seeking and dramatic. Even now, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] silenced because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and everyone in my family can't help but talk over the other. I get it. It's the way they learned to argue and talk growing up. I was always yelled at for ""talking back"" (you know, what it's always called whenever a child tries to defend themself) and taught that that was bad behavior. So, when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I don't want to talk anymore. If it's once, I might try again. If it's more than once, then what's the point? You're already showing me that you won't listen. You don't have the right to get mad just because I've chosen not to talk now. This is also part of what my mother would call my ""180s,"" where there would be a shift in my mood. I would be fine, and the next minute I wasn't. Well, okay. Did you ever think to ask why? Did you ever think that maybe something happened in that one minute that I was reacting to? No. I was just yelled at for making a scene or being a drama queen. It didn't matter that something happened. It felt more that it mattered that I ruined the mood.

So, I got drunk really drunk for the first time in my life back in February and called her around 3-5 in the morning. I had to spill my guts out to her. I keep trying to think of a way to properly explain everything to her to make her understand exactly what I went though but finally realized after the call ended that I probably never will be able to. She didn't go through everything I went through and nothing else will ever be able to make it clearer. I also felt guilty after the call. I woke her up in the middle of the night to dump everything on her. She told me she doesn't know how to help me, and I can't really think of anything. I think the only real thing I wanted from her was to admit she was wrong and that she should have prioritized my safety over everything else she was worried about then.

I was distraught. Since then, I had recorded so many videos and had tried to write this stuff out so many times. However, they were always during breakdowns and episodes, so I would delete or trash them after. I've been so anxious of the consequences and whatever will come from this. But you know what? That should have never been a problem I should've been made to face to begin with.

Why am I doing this? Why now?

I feel like I have suffered so much because of this. I never got to have a real childhood, and it's hard to grow up and act like an adult now because of it. No one takes me seriously because I can't help but act like a child, being meek and complaining about small things. That's fine. I understand it's not their fault, that's just how I have presented myself. But if I am [REDACTED_NAME] going to pass over this wall, I need to do what is going to help me first.

I've pulled at every last straw I possibly could, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] so utterly broken and may never be the better for it if I don't put this out there. I've confided in friends, I've talked to family about it, and I've seeked help from mental health professionals/therapists and life counselors on multiple occasions. I've used writing and music as an outlet. And as much as I love them all and truly appreciate that they're in my life, I've also used my friends and co-workers as distractions. Nothing seems to help...

I've only had one truly frightening PTSD experience that I never wish to have again. About a two/three months ago, I was lying down for sleep, and after a while, I felt like I could see Tony hovering over my body. I freaked out and left the room. It happened again the next night, and the second time, I could also feel sensations on my leg as if he were rubbing his hands all up and down them. Thankfully, nothing like that has happened since, but for the few nights following, I was terrified to go to sleep.

\- To you, specifically... I've never hated you, not once in my life. Yes, I told you I wanted to tell my baby brother about it. I wanted to wait until I was ready, yes, but I also wanted to wait until I felt \*he\* was ready. You told him what happened with Tony, without my knowledge or permission. How DARE you take that from me. You want to know how to help? Stop talking about it. Stop talking about me. Quit telling everyone about my life, especially the personal details that I might not want them to know. For such a people-pleaser, it feels like you never seem think how the things you do will affect my life. Stop helping. People want to ask about me? Send them to me, then.

\- Not only that; you're still not setting the story straight! You didn't tell him what his father did to me. You only told him that I \*accused\* Tony. Even to this very day, it still seems like you're defending him over me. And what really boggles my mind is that you are still friends with this man. What am I doing wrong? Why am I not enough?

\- And most of all, how dare you do that to my baby brother. He wasn't ready for that. You sent him out into the world with that when he's the most vulnerable. He just joined the military - who already have such high suicide rates. A Marine killed himself when we were in tech school, and I don't want that to be my brother. You never had the right to lay something so heavy on him like that while he is leaving home - \*as an 18-year-old,\* - to go out into the world on his own.

\- I will thank you, though. Thank you for removing the biggest hurdle I have had in recent years in exposing my rapist.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, the last time I checked, the statute of limitations was long up, so nothing of legal repercussion can be done anymore...

I am [REDACTED_NAME] this now because this is the only thing left I can think of to keep me from further disaster. I had to suffer for something that was done to me, and the perpetrator never had to face consequences. How does that seem right? I know this is going to blow up in my face. I know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to face backlash because that's what always happens. Only, now Tony can't escape. His name and face is all over the internet. I want everyone to know what he's done to me. This is his punishment.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] this now because my trauma and my unwellness bleeds into the relationships of those I grow close to. It has affected every aspect of how I react to things and it affects my relationships negatively. I feel like all I do is make those close to me miserable. Thankfully, I have someone who truly loves me and is willing to help me through the bad times. In exposing everything I have gone though, I am [REDACTED_NAME] that this weight will finally lift from my shoulders and bring me relief for once.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] it today because when everything came out, I was told I had ruined Christmas. Fine, then. How about I \*actually\* ruin it for you this year. And, yes, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] mad about it. I have every right to be upset about everything that happened.

I also have several beautiful nieces now and friends who have beautiful children. Take this as a lesson to listen to your kids when they tell you they are being abused. Sure, in some cases, a child might lie about something like that for some stupid reason. However, when they are telling the truth and truly need you to protect them, don't fail your children. This man has not even been registered as a sex offender from what I could find, so even as grown women, be careful around him. And protect your fucking children, for fuck's sake.

And for those of you who want to keep me silenced-- Go ahead. Report the post or do whatever else it is you feel you need to. This is not the only place I've spoken out. Welcome to the Digital Age.

...

I've said my piece, and this is all I want to talk about it. It's caused enough stress and anxiety on me finally deciding to put it all out there. I don't want to answer the same questions over and over and constantly think about everything once it's out. I just want this to finally be over and done with.

To anyone who may be worried, this is not a goodbye post or anything of that nature. No, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] fine, and I won't lie about it here, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] in danger. Unfortunately, I will still be here for some time to come.

You can comment or DM me all you want, but understand that I will not answer until I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. It might take any amount of time, or I may never answer. I am [REDACTED_NAME] obligated to answer.

I understand that some in my family may want to lash out for whatever their reasons may be. Say what you want, ask your questions, but I may not answer. Especially if I am [REDACTED_NAME] accused of things that are not true that you want to believe. I am [REDACTED_NAME] obligated to answer.

Hello, good afternoon. Before I begin to tell you my story, I must give you 3 important explanations about my life so that you understand what has brought me to this situation.

Explanation 1: I am [REDACTED_NAME] antisocial person since I was a child. I have never been bullied but in a way I bullied myself for as long as I can remember. I was nervous when people talked to me, I didn't know how to relate, I have always been disgusted by the way I look. I was always afraid of what others would think of me etc. I never knew if it was because of some nl diagnosed disorder but the point is that it made me anxious and depressed which necessitated prescription meds. But everything exploded when the pandemic started when I was 15 years old. I thought that thanks to virtuality I could overcome everything. Take advantage of this time to improve myself. But no, as I was going through this age, what happened to every kid happened. Acne came, but my case was an abnormal one. The hormonal imbalance of age, plus the genetic inheritance of two parents with sensitive and susceptible skins, plus a constant stress that agorated me mentally made my acne so abnormal that specialists had to see it. My face was full, unrecognizable. And my self-esteem was at rock bottom. I wouldn't leave my room, I wouldn't turn on the cameras for virtual classes. I was in a constant hole and it was getting worse. I weighed 100 kilos when I was 15 years old and I was 5'10"". This is just a context, you don't have to worry. At almost 18 years old I have lost almost 30 kilos and I am [REDACTED_NAME] little by little. I relate better, sometimes it is hard for me but I no longer think so much about what people think.

Explanation 2: During that time when I was in a deep depression hole, I started to frequent the Internet more. You know, forums, discord servers, apps to meet people. And it was on one of those servers that this all started.

Explanation 3: two months after joining a discord server and meeting new people I fell in love with a girl from another country who I called girl 1. I tried not to get my hopes up too high because she was from another country and was still young. We both knew we liked each other and were considering starting something. But, a week after we confessed she became a girlfriend of a guy in our group of friends. I knew I shouldn't get my hopes up but I think I fell into depression because of the shock that my first love would replace me like that. Anyway, five months later I met girl 2.  She was nice and I ended up falling in love with her. Her too, the problem? It seems she had a crush on me and a friend and didn't know what to do. Although in the end she chose me, eventually the thought that I might not be chosen began to haunt me. We ended things as friends and got along well even though we don't talk anymore. Anyway, 6 months later I fell in love. This time not spontaneously but with a girl (girl 3) who I had been friends with for 1 year. She felt different, we had the same tastes, same mood, same hobbies. We seemed perfect together. We both liked each other but didn't want to formalize. Me because I still had self-esteem issues and she because her mother was very strict and conservative. But I really liked her so I decided that as a first step in my personal improvement, I would go to her country to meet her and her mother. Talk to them and formalize with him permission from the mother. The old fashioned way I guess. Girl 3 was very happy. My dad supported me because he already knew her and had spoken to her before, we were making plans to go in two months. This happened around June 2022. By this point I had decided to leave the Internet in general but I kept talking to her through WhatsApp. Everything was fine until suddenly for a week she stopped talking to me. Without warning, I thought something happened with her mother but thanks to my best friend I found out she became a girlfriend of a guy. I was devastated, I relapsed into self-harm. I had a severe anxiety attack that I hadn't had in 1 years. It was so bad that I had to call my dad to calm me down. It was horrible to go through that. Things got better, we talked months later, she accepted her mistake and I accepted that I got my hopes up too high. We ended well and we talk from time to time. Why I tell you all this. Because as you will see from past experiences I have developed a fear or trauma of being replaced. 

Now I do. The story of the title that brought you here. If you made it this far thank you. You are an empathetic person.

Two years ago at my lowest point, on one of these servers I met my best friend who we'll just call (BF) to differentiate from the other girls. We were both mods on a server and we became friends. I liked her but at this time I didn't develop love for her I was in transition from what happened with girl 1. But we became pretty close when I helped her deal with a problem with her lunatic ex. About this guy I'll just say that idiot was a manipulative creep.

 Anyway, within 2 months of this she became friends with a guy from her town that I met on discord as well. He was a nice guy and we became close friends. By this point I was already friends with girl 3 and was about to start something with girl 2. Little by little I made him closer to BF, she was nice to me and we trusted each other. We each had our problems and we would tell each other and help each other. I would tell her about my insecurities and she would tell me about her problems with her alcoholic father. 

Just as we both talked about our partners asking for advice. By this point we became best friends. We would tell each other everything, so it went on until we reached June 2022. I had decided to leave the internet to concentrate on my development and school altogether. But I had not stopped talking to her as we had our numbers. By this point we had had some problems as in the year of friendship it had become recurrent that I would give her advice and she would ignore me and it would backfire precisely because she ignored me.



 This did not matter to me. After all I wasn't her boss or anything. So every time it happened we would laugh at the irony. Anyway, a month goes by since I left and we find out that her boyfriend has been cheating on her for 2 months. Yes, it was ugly. We found the girls and they apologized because they didn't know. While he was upset because he felt that they were manipulating everything against him. Yes, as you can see this guy who we will call (Ex1) was a manipulator. I guess we should have seen him before but he seemed nice. He was my friend and I had his number, I didn't insult him. I just told him if he cared about her not to talk to her until she calmed down. I spent the next 3 months helping BF get over this, get her to open up and accept her problems as the issue with her father was getting worse. It was a difficult time but I made sure I was there for her just as she was there for me 3 months ago when girl 3 broke my heart. 

Now comes something that continues to make me feel guilty. In these 3 months, I don't know why. I fell in love with her, maybe it was the closeness that was generated based on her breakup that happened. The fact that we were constantly talking to help her or just because. All that added to the fact that she has always been nice nice plus she is pretty cute made me have romantic feelings towards them. I don't know what I said at the moment. I felt like I was taking advantage of her. That everything I did helping her was for this and I didn't like it. I felt like I took advantage of the trust and closeness she gave me. So I decided not to say anything. To wait for it to pass or to feel that I was no longer taking advantage of the situation. Well, things got better. November 2022 and she was mostly over it. She was doing better and that made me happy, so I felt it was time to tell her how I felt. Not looking to be reciprocated, but to let her know and relieve me of that burden. But, a week before the beginning of December and, she tells me that she has a new boyfriend who we will call EX2.

Because of our closeness I knew that she was not in a position to have a new relationship. Sure, she had improved but I could tell that what happened to her before was still bothering her and prevented her from being good with her new boyfriend.

Now, what I am [REDACTED_NAME] to say will sound like jealousy but I ask for a vote of confidence because later on my words will become true. I already knew about this guy. I didn't trust him, I knew him from discord and everything I knew about him made it clear to me that I didn't trust him. 

And I told my friend this when she gave me hints that they were getting along. I told her that someone like that would do her no good in her recovery process. But as you can see she didn't listen to me. This happened again as with EX1 two months before the infidelity was discovered they were having problems and I advised BF to end the relationship as she felt distrustful of him and he was starting to be distant. I told them that this was not healthy but they did not listen to me. 



Then the cheating happened. I used to laugh at this type of situation, but now it hurt me that he didn't even seem to take my advice into account. I didn't expect her to do everything I told her, just to take into account the opinion of the person she said was her best friend. Well the month of December 2022 became hard. She started talking to me less. 



I thought it was because of problems but it started to become clear to me that she just liked to spend time with her boyfriend. Which wasn't bad I mean, he was her boyfriend. But of the few times she talked to me it was her asking for advice or just telling me about her boyfriend.  This. I didn't like it, since I liked her I felt like I was in the anti imposed friendzone and again I felt replaced. But it wasn't her fault in a way. She didn't owe me love, I did everything because I loved her and wanted to help her. So before I developed hatred for her I decided to put a stop to it. A few days before Christmas I told her that I liked her. And I told her that it would be good to take some time out of our friendship to improve both of us. Because she was leaving me aside. And it was wrong for me to feel uncomfortable in the face of her happiness because even though she started talking to me more again I still felt uncomfortable and that wasn't fair to her. So I told her that when she thinks we can get better she should talk to me again. And so it happened, two months passed, I turned 17, moved out and entered this phase where I no longer have the same fears as before. 



We got to February 2023. As I said I was already better. And that's when BF came back, we talked. She said she missed me and that she felt things could get better. That she would try to be a better friend but I made it clear to her that that was not the point but to communicate better because she was a great friend and emotional support for me. I thought that after two months my feelings of love were over but they were not. After a few weeks of talking I understood that they were still there. But I made up my mind, I wasn't going to let this ruin our friendship again so I decided to kill them little by little. It didn't work for the most part but I made sure this wasn't a drag between us. It worked and we went back to being great friends.



We went back to the way things used to be, we would tell each other everything, help each other and talk about her life. My family was aware of her and sometimes she would greet them when we video called. Because she still had family problems only her mother was aware of me and seemed to have a good impression. 

Well, as time went on I realized that she was having distrust issues again with her boyfriend EX2. Just like she had with EX1, I told her it was normal because of what happened to her before. I stopped thinking of EX2 as a bad person and focused more on helping her and gave her advice. But she wouldn't listen to me and had problems because of that. Sometimes she would stop talking to me because she would get discouraged and come back like new. Back to this again. It wasn't wrong for her to ask me for advice but I felt like that friend who is always there for you to ask for things. And that added to the fact that most of the time she would ask me for advice and then seem to disregard it. I know that this issue of the advice I give her doesn't sound so important and big but believe me, it became a strong issue between us because she told me that she was aware but sometimes she felt that I had her in a bubble always taking care of her. This bothered me because I always helped her when she asked me to. So that she didn't feel that I was overwhelming her. 



She just didn't want to do what I told her to do, which wouldn't be bad but when it became constant and always with serious issues it started to affect me. Now comes a plot twist that I think was already coming because of the name I gave it.



That's right. She and EX2 broke up. Not because he was unfaithful but because well, he was a psycho. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] kidding. We found out that he kept threatening any guy she knew and felt was a threat. How? The fucker was in the military and had access to that kind of thing to track people. So we also found out that he was older than he said he was. Plus he revealed that when BF and EX1 broke up. EX2 was already after my friend, asking people what she liked and approaching her with bad intentions. Yeah. That was all pretty fucked up. I had to counsel her and mediate between them to get things over with. 



Here comes something that fucked me up. This guy, EX2 despite being a diagnosed psychopath,(we found out later) despite being a freeloader and all. He took my advice more than she did. BF would ask me my opinion on the subject and when I would tell her how it would be good to end things she would ignore me and do as she saw fit. In the end things ended, I didn't even find out from her that they had ended. I found out from a mutual friend. 



I decided not to bother or express my annoyance that she never seemed to take my opinion into account. After all I had just gone through a relationship full of problems and lies so I thought it was understandable.



Now in the present. July 2023, 4 months since she and EX2 broke up and things are worse. It should be noted that in the middle of these months I told her that I have liked her for a while now because we were better off. I made it clear to her that I didn't want a relationship and I knew she wasn't ready either. She understood and actually told me that before she became EX1's partner she liked me. I won't lie, this made me happy for a few seconds but then I thought. ""That means she chose someone else instead of me"" I tried not to think about that since after all it's only because of my trauma of being replaced. Now, she meets yet another guy from her town who is quite nice. Esteluevo tells her that he is in love with her. BFF seriously thinks about it. I tell her it's not a good idea. That she's still upset about what happened and it would only hurt the guy. She didn't listen to me but at the same time she did. In a way they actually cut friendship because he became something weird and insistent. Which I warned myself about. 



And well. You may wonder what is the current situation that has led me to this. I will tell you dear reader. Actually in the last two months he has only called me twice. And both were to ask me for advice and then not to call me back. Despite the fact that I have been asking him for a while now if he has time to watch movies together or things about things in general. 



Our chats turned into Deserts. He talks to me often every other day where it's just me wishing him a good day. And when those two days pass he replies me with an ""xd"" to some nice message I leave him. And he talks to me like it's nothing for a few hours and then back to the same thing. There are times when we chat for two days but it's because he has problems and asks me for advice. And then he leaves. 



This is what led me to post this. I feel like she takes it for granted that I will always be here for her to give her advice. Even though she usually doesn't listen to me. So I feel there is less value in her asking me for advice. She only calls me when there are problems. When I tell her I feel bad she just says ""I hope it passes"" and when she tells me I make sure she knows I am [REDACTED_NAME] to help her etc. Don't get me wrong. I don't want and never wanted anything in return for helping her. She just doesn't feel resipocro.and here comes what hurt me the most. 



BF and EX1 are back to being friends. I told her it was a bad idea as it gives me hints that it is with ulterior motives but hey. It is his decision and I respect it. What hurts me the most is that on those days when she doesn't talk to me I see her online and uploading to her WhatsApp and instagram statuses as she talks and has a good time with him. How they both make it clear they are great friends. I felt replaced again. But ne I told myself that she has never owed me anything, that she is in her right to have friends and if she wants someone more than me no problem. But two days ago everything got worse because of one stupid thing. Alfin talked to me after two days and we talked well, I noticed she had a match icon on WhatsApp and I asked her with whom. He told me with EX1. I don't know what happened at that moment that I couldn't hold back the tears and he started crying sitting on my chair. I didn't understand why. These match icons were things I had never cared too much about. I only did it once in a while for memes. So, why am I crying? Because I can't hold back the tears when I see his profile picture. Because I care so much about something so stupidThat's when I remembered, I asked for a funny one a month ago. It wasn't something as basic as photo sharing. It meant she didn't think as much of me as she did of him. 



If I was her normal friend this would pass as nothing or I would laugh but for months she has assured me that I am [REDACTED_NAME] best friend. That she appreciates me etc. But nowadays he doesn't talk to me and EX1 is a problem. It has already happened more than once that he tells me something taking for h3cho that it is something he has already told me but it turns out that I am [REDACTED_NAME] aware of it and it is the first time he tells me. We pretend it's just me being forgetful but I know for a fact that he hasn't told me those things. He doesn't take me into account. Which hurts me.



Now comes something that is not his fault as it is because of my issues, since I left the internet and moved I only talk to 3 people. BFF and my best friends from my previous city who I see every weekend. But they and I don't like to chat, we like to let it all out in person. So by chat I only talk to her . So with how little she talks to me I practically don't talk to anyone. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] getting better at socializing but I feel alone. I feel abandoned. 



All this with all the times I've been replaced are tearing me apart. All the time I think maybe it's just me being paranoid. Or maybe all the times it was because there is a constant in my acting that I still don't notice that makes them walk away from me for someone else. 



That's why I did this, I need help and I don't know who to ask for it. I don't want to tell my parents yet for fear. And I don't know if maybe I am [REDACTED_NAME] one who is behaving badly in all this. After all she had already told me that she has an avoidant disorder. When we come from talking to each other a lot it's hard to believe. I want to cut our friendship at once because more and more I start to generate bad ideas about her, I think that maybe she is aware of the harm she is doing to me and it amuses her. Even if this were true I would rather leave with the idea of the great friendship we had. But, leaving would mean being alone for a while again and losing a friendship of 2 years that has helped me improve. I owe much of my personal development to her and I don't know if maybe I should fight for this friendship. But it seems like she doesn't even try to have a friendship at this point.



This post is me asking. I am [REDACTED_NAME], afraid of being wrong. Afraid of being manipulated. Afraid of being paranoid. Afraid of being alone again. Afraid of being replaced for the fourth time. If you are reading this. If you have the slightest bit of advice or words of encouragement please leave them. I don't know what to do at this point and I feel nervous.

m310x5,1615497495.0,2021-03-11 21:18:15,TrueOffMyChest,I didn’t realize how it feels to not see your sexuality represented until today,"I’m straight — my friends even call me the “straightest straight girl” because I fit all the stereotypes (make of that what you will).  I also write online.  Recently, one of the sites I write for used a photo of a lesbian couple as a feature photo for one of my pieces, and I thought that was really cool because most sites use straight couples for all general love pieces that aren’t LGBTQ+ specific.  I definitely had a moment of, “This doesn’t represent my sexuality,” but then I realized that this is the *first* and possibly *only* time this has happened to me, while people in the LGBTQ+ community face this every day.  That single moment of, “Huh, this is different than usual” is worth having if it means that LGBTQ+ people get to see their love stories represented photographically or otherwise in the media.

To anyone reading this... I hate that our society shoves heterosexuality down our throats.  If you’ve felt underrepresented, I hope we as a society can practice more inclusive imaging so that everyone can see themselves represented and know that their stories are valid.

EDIT: I think this is the most awards I’ve ever gotten!  Thanks, all! 😭",4263
wrdoaq,1660809991.0,2022-08-18 08:06:31,TrueOffMyChest,My awful ex is a child predator,"Idk where to even start this... I originally told my story on a different subreddit under a anonymous account, but I don't really care anymore.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if it's even technically r*pe... I've been told by several people that it was, and other people that it wasn't.  I will try not to go into too much detail but let's just say when I was in high school I had a year-long relationship with somebody that I loved and it ended on bad terms so I became very desperate and I went to the first person I could just to fill the hole in my heart. This kid was the same age as me and in the same grade so it kind of worked out perfectly he was a little shy as was I and our relationship was pretty awkward just because of that... he was a furry, just like I am (technically I'm a scalie, cuz my sona is a dragon, but same thing). He did a lot of dubstep and made and sold fidget spinners and he was a little weird I'll admit but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] too, so I didn't mind it, lol. The first day we said anything to each other we exchanged numbers and he immediately asked me out and because I was so desperate I said yes because I just wanted to fill the hole in my heart which I know was very stupid... and then it only took a week before he started asking me for more than just dating...

He bought me gifts and he bought me food when he knew I didn't have money to afford lunches otherwise and he guilt tripped me into saying yes to s*x. I can't remember if I gave him written or verbal or maybe both consent but I know I at least gave him some kind of consent before doing it... the school we went to had a wooded area nearby so we went there after school one day and did it and before and while we did it I tried everything to give off the impression that I was uncomfortable with what we were doing... I wanted to tell him no but while we were in there all alone I was honestly scared that he would hurt me because he was bigger and stronger than me... I didn't say anything but I know for a fact that as far as almost anybody could tell I was uncomfortable and not okay with what was happening but he kept going..

Afterwards it took me a few years to finally break contact with him because he kept making new accounts to try to get in contact with me and it took my current boyfriend messaging him and telling him to leave me alone for him to finally stop... after us doing it, he went around the school saying he ""fulfilled his fantsdy of f*cking like a wolf."" That was never evem discussed and I felt gross af after that, although luckily he never told others it wa sme he did it with. And after that, he tried shipping his sona with a friend of mine's sona and tried getting them to draw furry p*rn of it. They hardly knew each other. I realized he was pretty disturbed at that point.

And then today I found out that he has been taken into custody for having child p*rnography on his phone... and while during our relationship even though we were minor is he didn't show me any kind of signs of being that kind of a creep I feel disgusting as of today even though I haven't talked to him in quite a few years... I don't know how to explain how I feel right now I just feel like I should have known the signs even though he might not have done this stuff until after I talk to him... none of my family and only a few of my friends know what he did to me... My bf knows... I hate calling it r*pe because I feel like it doesn't count because I technically gave consent.... I didn't really know where else to post this and I just needed to get it off my chest... I know this is a pretty heavy subject and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to anyone I may have offended or hurt in any way, shape, or form..

I don't know if his trial is going to be public but part of me wants to go to it if it is and I have a letter written to him to send him through his Facebook, I just am not sure if I should send it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure how to feel or what to do. I feel pretty disgusted that I dated a future child predator and I don't really know how to cope with the fact that that's what he turned into even though it has nothing to do with me now?? Do I even have a right to feel this way?",3
162nzsj,1693135916.0,2023-08-27 11:31:56,TrueOffMyChest,I’m fairly certain I’m the fat woman in this video. This is my story.,"Link to the video: https://youtu.be/DRKcclNq02k?si=6Swv7yBX-7pd725K  
I haven’t seen any information about this video, but it’s the earliest instance I could find of this video, or GIF, in some places.   
To recap for those people who aren’t wanting to navigate a YouTube link or can’t watch it for whatever reason: there’s a very popular GIF out there of a fat woman climbing up an inflatable water slide, struggling, and eventually wiping out the kids in line.  
I’m fairly certain it’s me—the dates line up, the location looks about the same, the person in the black shirt absolutely looks like someone I know that was there when it happened. I would say that it is me, but I’m skeptical—I don’t exactly have any reference pictures to check, but I don’t think my ass was that big. At least, it’s not now. The body shape is a bit different, but I don’t have any images of myself from this time period to compare it to.  
  
First thing’s first—when this happened, I wasn’t a woman. I was fourteen years old. I’m twenty-five now. I’ve always struggled with my weight. I’m actually in the process of getting gastric bypass surgery now—I need 6 months of medically supervised weight loss. I’m on month 2, and have lost 30 of the 70 pounds I was told I needed to lose before I had surgery. I’ve seen some horrifically unkind comments about this, and, since I’ve always struggled with my weight. I haven’t been in the mental spot to come out and tell my story until now—I’m not even really sure I am, still, but I think a good sign is that I’m willing to talk about it, at least.  
Second off, this happened at a 4th of July employee/family celebration for the city we lived in at the time, and myself, the person in the black t-shirt and wet hair at the bottom, and a few other people who weren’t there in the frame were living in a group home. I spent the entire summer between 8th grade and my freshman year of high school in this group home.  
The reason I was in the group home was because at the time, I was still in the foster care system. My caseworker put me in a group home because I had a nervous breakdown seeing my abusive father at the last family review hearing—this was just after the trial for his abuse towards me, and no one informed me my father would be at the review hearing. I wanted to go to the review hearing because I kept hearing different stories between my GAL, my caseworker, and my mother, and I wanted to hear the truth for myself. They never told me why I couldn’t go, and I didn’t know my father would be there. If I had known, I wouldn’t have gone. I didn’t, I saw him, and this was just after I thought I would never have to see my abuser ever again. My caseworker took that as me being unruly and out of control, and she placed me in a group home for it—without the judge’s approval. When the next review hearing happened three months later, I was allowed to go to that, and I was told up front my father would be there. I didn’t have such a visceral reaction that time. The judge chewed the caseworker a new one and I was sent home immediately.   
We were there at the party not to celebrate, but to clean up after the BBQ that had just wrapped up. Once we were done, we were allowed to play around and hang out. I happen to love the water, and I knew I was too old and too big to go down those water slides, but I did it anyway because why not? That happened, no one was hurt, but people were pissed, I was embarrassed, and even moreso when I found the video a few years later. I’ve never talked about it until now.

143fn05,1686150196.0,2023-06-07 15:03:16,TrueOffMyChest,My ex ruined my mental health,"I don’t know why Im posting this, probably just to vent. 

The cast of my story:
Hunter: Me/Op
Ava: My ex
Thomas: My other ex
Carl: Third ex

For context Im a 18 year old guy and my relationship with my ex was polyamorous for the last two years of the relationship.

I met Ava trough Instagram in 2019, we became friends quickly and I didn’t think much of her at the time.

Things quickly changed after I had my first break up and she had hers. We became a couple that summer.
At first things were great! I was super into her, she was super into me & I was on cloud 9 at that point.

Then I moved cities and lost my social life. I became very depressed and isolated but she was there for me. She was my only social life for months and I became very dependent on her.

Now she had this group of friends that she introduced me to, I was a little hesitant at first, but managed to chat with some of them. I wouldn’t have called them friends back then but I digress. Ava had a tendency to push me to do things I wasn’t comfortable with but back then I tought it was just to get me to come out of my shell.

Now, I don’t exactly remember when we decided that we would have a third in our relationship, but eventually she introduced me to Carl. Carl was admittedly a very handsome and nice guy. I fell for him pretty easily.

I noticed that Carl was a bit more distant to me then he was with Ava. This led to him admitting to lying about being attracted to me. I was obviously hurt and pissed, I basically told him that he was awful for lying to me to get into Avas pants. The motherfucker had the nerve to call me childish.

Afterwards me and Ava stayed toghter even when I was hurt, she helped me. Little did I know that she was still buddy buddy with Carl afterwards.

Fast forward to when I got accepted into my dream school in 2021, Ava introduced me to Thomas. I was very hesitant at first and nearly refused to talk to him, but I decided to give it a shot.
Thomas was kind, funny, nerdy and overall pretty wonderful. It took one phonecall with him and I was head over heels in love with Thomas.

During this time me and Ava began to bicker, a lot. We made up in the end but it was beginning to be exhausting mentally.

I eventually came out as Asexual and they seemed cool with it. But at one point Ava began telling me about HER FRIENDS sex life, when I told her that I was uncomfortable and to please stop, She wouldn’t stop so I ended up raising my voice in the middle of the street to tell her to stop. People were looking at me and I felt humiliated.

After this things were ok(?) for a while before I ended up having a mental breakdown a few days before our anniversary, I spent a few days recovering but on our anniversary, She was pissed that I didnt make her a gift, that really made me angry and we ended up fighting. 
She knew that I was feeling unwell, but she had the gull to accuse me of putting no effort in.

During all of theese events she had on and off drama with her friends, she vented to me about it quite a lot and I tried my best to give advice and support.
She was often in the wrong so I gave her advice, but she rarely took it.

After one of theese ”Dramas” she gave me the impression that one of our mutual friends had extorted nudes out of her. I was furious and cut contact with this friend.
(Keep this in mind)

After this Ava during calls with me and Thomas began to push Thomases buttons so he would get angry and argue with her.
Now I did tell her to stop doing that, even when she claimed that it was ”playful” and ”just banter”, it was extremely uncomfortable because I was in the middle of it + I have childhood trauma about this kind of thing and she knows.
She basically told me that ”I need to learn to get over it”

This happened a lot.

I began to stop feeling the butterflies anymore in the relationship but I was so scared to be alone and too stubborn to end it and stayed anyway.

Over time I began to have a very uncomfortable realization about myself that I had been supressing for a while.
I had identified as Bisexual for a long time before, but I ended up coming out as gay.

I explained this to Ava and told her that she was my exeption and that I wouldn’t leave her.
During this she told me that ”That doesent sound like being gay to me” and ended up getting a gay mutual friend to come into the call to convince me that I wasn’t gay.

And for some reason that wasn’t a dealbreaker for me.

After that ordeal, things seemed to go back to normal.
But I began to notice something, Whenever Thomas showed any signs of being attracted to me at all, Ava started to show off.
I didn’t say anything but it began to make me uncomfortable.

Time passed and eventually I needed a break from the relationship, we talked about it and I was gone for like a few days.
After the break ended I was in a groupchat with Ava and her friendgroup, she decided to joke about me needing a break and humiliated me in front of a lot of people.

Im gonna skip over 2 months.

During this time, I didn’t want to lie to her and myself anymore. I wasn’t in love with her anymore. I decided to break up with her.

So I did.

Afterwards she began yelling at me, accusing me & over all being very nasty towards me.
Then after like a day, she had the nerve to ask if I still wanted to be friends. I blocked her.

A few weeks after the break up I began to talk with one of her former friends and got to know some extremely awful shit.

Here we go:

That friend that ”extorted nudes” from her, never fucking wanted those nudes and told her as much! 
She nearly destroyed his social life just because he didn’t return her feelings.

Next one really pissed me off

She was actively trying to cheat and ended up punching a guy just because he wasn’t attracted to her!

Im so glad Im no longer in contact with her.

FUCK YOU AVA.


Anyhow, If you read to the end, thank you for listening and letting me vent

She'd been having issues with the battery and asked for a jump. I was parked closest and actually had cables so I jumped the car. The other 2 people we leave with stuck around just in case things didn't work. Got her started and on her way and we all left. Quick, easy, done.

Come in today and get greeted by an email to stop by HR. 2 people filed complaints and apparently HR agrees that the whole thing was ""An inappropriate interaction between coworkers."". I was given a warning and sent home for the day. Tomorrow I'll be moved to a different work group. Texted everyone from last night and we had dinner tonight to talk, all claim not to have filed a complaint. 
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] really mad, just confused. Didn't mean to harass anyone, not sure how I did. At least it's an easy problem to avoid in the future. Probably gonna look for another job.

111gaca,1676313210.0,2023-02-13 18:33:30,TrueOffMyChest,Being a dad is making me realize how fucked up my parents were,"When I was 14, I mouthed off to my dad and he held my head under the water of our pool until I thought I was going to die. He let me up so I could gasp in a few breaths, then shoved me down again. I don't remember how many times he let me up and pushed me down, but it felt like forever. My mom just watched, like she always did. It's not like I didn't know my parents were abusive, even when I was a kid, I realized that none of my friends had parents like mine, but I was also a pain in the ass as a teenager and I thought that excused it somewhat. 

Now I look at my daughter and I can't imagine wanting to hurt her or scare her or make her cry, not ever. She turned 15 last week. She's older than I was when my dad almost drowned me. She drives me crazy sometimes, sometimes she can be annoying and selfish and bratty and spoiled, and there is nothing she could ever, ever do that would make me do that to her. My mom never actually hurt me herself, and I used to think that made a difference, but now I imagine seeing someone hurt my daughter the way my dad hurt me and not stopping it or protecting her, or even going to her afterwards to comfort her, and it's almost as unthinkable.

Whatever it was that made my parents hate me, it must not have been my fault because there's nothing that could have made me deserve that. My dad wasn't good to my brothers, but he was better to them than he was to me, and I thought that meant that I was worse than they were, but that's not it. Sure, I tried to provoke him on purpose sometimes when I was mad, but that doesn't matter. I didn't really, fully get it before I was a parent, but now I look at my daughter, and the love is overwhelming. No matter how obnoxious she can be sometimes, I love her more than anything in the world. I can't understand anyone could look at their kid and not feel the way I feel.",4764

She would go weeks in-between washing her hair but she would always just say ""it's not healthy to wash your hair often"". But then her head was a literal grease ball. 

After spending some time with new ladies via bumble + tinder, it's like the most magnificent revelation: That women CAN have proper hygiene and their hair can smell AMAZING. My mind is simply blown, and it makes me so very grateful for following through with getting a divorce. 

To all the women out there with hair that smells like berries and other tantalizing scents, I salute you. That is all.",3758
cgf9of,1563812266.0,2019-07-22 16:17:46,TrueOffMyChest,"Between the ages of twelve and fifteen I was absent from school more often than not. I tell people it was from illness, but that isn't the entire truth of it.","This isn't something I talk about a lot in my life. When I do talk about it, I try to be as brief as possible, skipping over the more uncomfortable details of my adolescent years. Today I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to do that, so it might get a bit long. 

When I was one year old, my parents noticed that when I walked around the house, I often mumbled ‘ow’ as I made my clumsy steps. They looked at my knees and noticed that they were swollen. The image of this always makes me think about ancient Sparta, and how if I’d been born there, I’d likely have been tossed over a cliff like in the movie 300. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to be born in the 20th century into a country with a great healthcare system, so there my story doesn’t involved any infanticide. It didn’t take long before I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and prescribed anti-inflammatory medication to treat it. 

If you don’t know what rheumatoid arthritis is, you might be wondering how a one-year-old could get the same condition as your grandmother. Well I do have arthritis, but unlike osteoarthritis which is brought about by age, my rheumatoid arthritis was essentially the result of my immune system attacking itself. 

The medication was very successful in treating the disease, and eventually my symptoms all died down. I was left with a few slightly swollen finger and knee joints but was otherwise no worse for wear. The unfortunate part of rheumatoid arthritis though, is that once you have it, you have it. The symptoms can go away, but there’s no guarantee that they won’t flair up again later on in life. That’s exactly what happened when I was twelve. 

I was a bit of a goofy kid. I hadn’t started going through puberty yet, and was very unsure of myself. I liked making dumb jokes (I still do), I was terrible at sports and I absolutely loved history, likely engendered from playing countless hours of Age of Empires II. All things considered, a pretty normal twelve-year-old. 

It was about two weeks into the beginning of middle school when it started. I woke up with my hands and knees feeling very stiff and in quite a bit of pain. I told my parents about it that morning. Mom was concerned. Dad brushed it off as nerves over my school’s camping trip. A couple weeks later I woke up almost unable to get out of bed or go down the stairs from the pain. That marked when I started regularly going to the hospital. 

Over the next couple of months, I missed a lot of school. My symptoms would improve, and I would go back to school for a few days; then my symptoms would worsen, and I’d spend a few days at home. The medication I was taking had the side effect of wearing down the lining of my stomach, giving me stomach aches as well as joint pain. The days started running into weeks away from school. 

The timing couldn’t have been worse. When it started, I was *beginning to* make friends but hadn’t yet *made* friends. I hadn’t kept in close touch with any of my friends from elementary school either, and the arthritis had made it impossible to keep playing soccer or hockey. I was beginning the loneliest period of my life. 

I don’t know when exactly it was that I stopped missing school because I was sick and started missing school because of anxiety. I don’t think there was an exact moment in time when that happened. Over time my symptoms improved. The stomach pain went away, and the arthritis got better. By the time I was fifteen it was mostly a nuisance, by the time I was around seventeen, it was more-or-less gone. But as my symptoms got better my anxiety got worse. 

It’s hard for me to accurately describe the anxiety I felt at school. There were a number of times when I came back after missing a few weeks in a row, but those days were very difficult. The friends who I’d started making at the beginning of the year had by that point formed their own friend groups. I tried joining them but felt very much an outsider. In my mind, they were normal, and I was the “kid who got sick”. This wasn’t helped by a student at my high school spreading the rumour that I was dead and a number of my peers approaching me to tell me they thought I had died (I hadn’t). Added to that was that I’d missed the better part of four months of class, and my school was less than accommodating of that fact (to put it mildly). They wanted to me to complete all of the assignments I’d missed in short order. On top of all of that was my brother, six years older than me, who was determined to make my life at home into a real hell on earth. 

Over the course of my time staying home, my brother hit me, threatened me, degraded me, insulted me, destroyed my entire room, and pressured me to start smoking marijuana (I did), by telling me I’d “be really cool if I smoked pot before getting to high school” (I wasn’t). When he got really violent, I would lock myself in the bathroom. 

So I retreated. I began staying home on days when I wasn’t sick, because it just felt too hard to climb the mountain of catch-up work the school gave me and to make friends with a bunch of kids who knew me as the. I slowly but surely stopped going to school altogether, regardless of how I was feeling. I told my parents that my joints were hurting, or that my stomach was hurting, regardless of whether or not it was true. Eventually, my parents transferred me to a more understanding school, but my attendance didn’t improve much. I would end up being absent for about half of seventh grade, more than half of eighth grade, nearly all of ninth grade and probably around half of tenth grade. 

The time I spent at home was miserable and incredibly lonely. I watched TV, quoting episodes of Corner Gas in the evenings to my parents. My mom feigned interest, my dad didn’t. I played video games, eventually graduating from Age of Empires II to Medieval II: Total War and then eventually to Starcraft II (I was ranked top 1000 in North America at my peak). Some days my brother would torment me. Others, he would leave me alone. My physical health quickly led to the deterioration of my mental health, and I became very depressed. 

For a while I thought about killing myself. I was deeply unhappy, and I felt like I was in such a hole that I didn’t know how to begin digging myself out, even if my symptoms did improve. I felt like I was trapped, without any way out. I was miserable at home, and I was miserable at school. I had missed so much school that I didn’t know how I was ever going to make it up. Even if I did manage to make it up, I had fallen irrecoverably behind my peers at a very young age. And I didn’t have anyone to talk about it with either. For a long time, the only people I really interacted with were doctors and my family. Between the ages of around 12 and 15, I didn’t have a single friend. 
I thought that maybe my depression was just a phase, and that a lot of kids felt this way during puberty. I distinctly remember googling suicide rates among youth, expecting to see a peak among children my age and then a decline as they got older. The actual result of course, is that suicide among children is very rare, and rates go up with age. My heart sank with the realization that this wasn’t just a phase but that I was only beginning my battle with mental illness. 

My parents did their best to help me through it. In some ways, they helped a lot. They talked with my middle schools to get me to pass, even though I’d been absent more than half the time and even came to an agreement with my high school to reduce the number of credits I’d have to make up. When it came to dealing with me though, they didn’t really know what to do. My dad clearly wanted me back at school. He would tell me that the medication would “make me a normal kid again”, adding to my feeling of alienation. There were a lot of days when I was feeling fine physically, but couldn’t bring myself to go to school, and I’m sure my parents could tell. My mom would usually let it be, but my dad always made me feel terrible about myself on those days. When I tried to tell him about my day after he got home from work, he would reply that he’d listen once I was back at school. 

My mom was trying her best, but when I was around 13, my brother’s behaviour started taking up the lion’s share of her attention. She could tell something was wrong but didn’t seem to know what to do about it. She once told me she didn’t know what to do and asked if I wanted her to get me a psychiatrist. I desperately wanted her to but didn’t know how to tell her that. I looked at my feet and quietly replied “I don’t know”. She dropped it and never brought it up again.  

I’m not really sure what it was that prompted me to start going to school again regularly. I think it was a number of factors. A big one was that my symptoms had largely gotten better by the time I was fifteen. I still had pain in high humidity, but it was nothing compared to how it had been at 12. The physical symptoms were largely gone, and I knew I had to stop using them as excuses. An even bigger factor was that after three years of repeating grade 12, my brother eventually graduated and moved out of the house. I finally felt like I had a place where I could be safe. Moreover, my parents’ attention to me changed. My mom was trying to work around my staying home by arranging home instruction for me, and my dad stopped berating me when I told him I couldn’t go to school. All-in-all, my mental health started slowly getting better. 

Starting back at school was very challenging. My peers had spent the past four years of their lives making and enjoying friendships, playing sports, learning new things, and having their first kisses. I’d spent the past four years of mine watching Oscar call Hank a jackass on Corner Gas, and learning how to defend against a four-gate rush in Starcraft. It took me a very long time to make friends and get back into the rhythm of going to classes and playing sports. 

By the time I was around eighteen, I was starting to feel ‘normal’ again. The social anxiety and depression I’d faced had gotten drastically better. I had real friends, I’d had my first kiss, and I was on track to finish high school with decent grades and only a semester behind the other kids my own age. I began telling myself that I was finally getting over what had happened to me. In some ways it was true. The time of troubles was finally over. I’d been through the worst of it, and things could only get better. 

The reality is though, I don’t think I’m ever going to fully get over what happened to me. I still struggle with mental health issues. The anxiety’s gotten much better, but I still feel nervous in large groups. The depression comes and goes, but it’s much less of a toxic living situation, and more of an annoying mother-in-law who stays over for a month without any notice. Lying to my parents about being sick so many times has given me the unshakable feeling that I’m something of a fraud. Even when I’m telling the truth, and I know that there’d be no reason to lie, I still feel like people are doubting me. This is to say nothing of the fact that my arthritis flared up again in university. 

I recently talked to someone who’d had the misfortune of getting a serious disease at around the same age I did. What she told me was that her illness shaped her, but it doesn’t define her. I found a lot of wisdom in that. As I’ve grown up, I’ve stared to realize that I can’t forget that experience, or pretend it never happened to me. Like any experience, I’ve tried to learn from it. To simply block it out is to deny myself the achievement of getting past it. In order to grow, I’ve had to realize that I am [REDACTED_NAME] defined by my illness, but I was shaped by it. 

This ended up being a lot longer than I anticipated. If anyone read all the way through, I just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate it!",51

1c7c5cg,1713468495.0,2024-04-18 19:28:15,TrueOffMyChest,Therapy made me realize what an awful person I was to my ex and it cost me what could have been a happy marriage,"I finally broke down and decided to go to therapy despite my ex (we'll get more into him later) heavily suggesting it over the course of my relationship. I wanted to know why I was attracted to men that mistreated me so much but she dragged me down to earth with my most recent ex. She basically laid out what I did wrong, asked why I did what I did and described my actions as abusive and how I should approach the same situation going forward.

I met my ex through a friend. He was a couple of years older than me and he graduated in the early stages of our relationship. He was so caring (coming to stay with me in the library after work just to be with me), bringing me take out during stressful study periods and just being there.

In retrospect, I treated him like garbage. After being with so many bad exes (we have a cheater, some guys who lied about wanting a relationship with me just to get sex, etc.), I kind of compartmentalized my feelings and would often box out the offending party. With the first couple of arguments, I would box out my ex for a couple of days to cool off and he'd text a couple of times of me boxing him out to ask when I'd be ready to talk and we would and things would be fine.

I guess because he was so great, I unconsciously held him to a much higher standard. We were supposed to watch a movie together after my exam period but he went with his friends instead. He offered to go again with me and wouldn't spoil it nor give his opinions so it would be like we were watching it the first time and I boxed him out for five days. He would do his texting apologizing and I would lash out at him. I never took any accountability for my actions. It seemed like even the smallest thing that I perceived was ""wrong"" resulted in me boxing him out. It all came to a head when he said that my boxing him out was stressing him out and that if I was so unhappy, I was free to leave, he wasn't going to force me to change. I promised to change.

For a time, things did change. I went on an internship so the stress of studying and tests were gone and we had the best year of our relationship. We communicated at even the smallest things and he got even more romantic with me. Even the most trivial events (like simple grocery shopping) ended up being a great date and I was truly happy. We'd even discussed getting married when my career was stable and he got me a silver ring that was engraved with our initials and my graduation date for my left ring finger. He called it a placeholder for the real thing when the time was right.

Then I went back to school. The last year of school was so bad. My lab partners were just mean or lazy. The instructors were brutal and I struggled with the material. My ex tried to help but, as my therapist showed me, that I lash out more when stressed. He came over and did the dishes but forgot to wash the pans. I screamed at him and boxed him out for a week. I noticed a change because he only texted once during the boxing out period. In hindsight, I realized that he was preparing to leave. After the week was up, he brought up our previous discussion about me boxing him out. I was stressed and he didn't seem to care (my therapist said that he was likely beyond pissed) so I gave him lip service.

At this point during our session, my therapist was blunt and told me ""you are \*very\* lucky he didn't leave you then and there"". The straw that broke his back was my birthday. He'd been skimping and saving for the last 6 months or so (like we'd go to cheaper restaurants and he dialed back his nights out with his friends, like swapping bar nights to take out and video games) but I didn't think he'd skimp on my birthday. He took me to a cheaper place (instead of our usual steakhouse visit) and his gift was bath-bombs and a basket of my favorite snacks and chocolates. I was pissed and snapped at him that he could be frugal with himself or his friends but I thought I was more important. Time flew by and I'd boxed him out for two weeks. He did not text once. When I called to ask him to come over and talk all he said was ""I made the mistake of trying to change you. You should be with someone who will take you ask you are. I'm [REDACTED_NAME]"" and I fired back with ""well I won't wait for you to come back"". Lo and behold, he (and all his friends and family) blocked me the minute the call ended. Luckily the friend that introduced us did not block me so we could stay friends.

When I finished that part of the story, my therapist did not hold back. She told me that I need to work on my self-importance, be more reflective on my actions and how they impact other people, how to manage my disappointment better and communicate with him better (like ask why he was being so frugal). I've done that and I came to a horrible realization that I was awful to him. My therapist made me write all the things he did for me and a list of how he wronged me and got boxed out (along with the length of boxing out). The wrong part of the list was longer than the good part but the good parts seemed to outweigh the bad. Then my therapist asked if I had ever considered that I was getting mad about the small things and using my ex as a whipping boy for my disappointment and frustration. At first I thought she didn't understand and as I think more, it sinks in and I feel sick.

I guess my ex got his revenge. I met with the friend that introduced us (we're quite close) and I cried and vented about what I told my therapist and asked her if I appeared to be controlling and abusive. She was silent for a minute and said ""yes. He told us everything and the others all dislike you for what you did.""  
She was a little angry too and said ""well, you know why he was being frugal?"" It was his IG showing a brand new iPhone, AirPod Pros and a few video games with the caption ""was saving up for a ring but guess I don't need that anymore. Dodged a bullet and got an iPhone out of the deal!""

It really did hurt. If I listened to him and sought out therapy sooner, maybe I would be engaged to that wonderful man. Apparently he was planning to do it at the convocation.

I just don't know what to do now. I threw this all away. I asked my friend not to inform me of his life anymore. It just hurts to think that another girl will get to experience the happiness he brought me. I pissed away the lottery winnings because I didn't know how to control my temper.

I deserve this.

E: I want to thank everyone who commented and provided insight. Honestly, as I typed my responses, I realized how much my friend did for me, I should thank her for not leaving me at this trying time.

I *suspect* that my ex deliberately did not give her the instructions to cut me out nor force her to choose between us. I don't have a lot of friends (well, she's like my only friend left) and he probably didn't want me to be alone. I guess that was his one last act of kindness.

I wish I could go back in time and cherish that man. Sadly he's gone.

  
**Update**

Since there was so much support, I guess I owe you all an update. I reached out to my friend to grab dinner and chat so I could thank her for her support. 

We had a nice chat and she said what you guys said- she was happy that I was getting help. I read a lot of your responses and quite a few of you emphasized with my ex. Honestly, I never really thought about what he went through during my boxing out. I just knew it triggered his anxiety and he didn't like it. So I did a stupid thing and decided to ask her.

First, I asked how he was doing. She asked if I really wanted to know. I did. You all said that being boxed out for periods of time caused trauma, I just wanted to see if he was ok. She just showed me a group photo of them. I couldn't recognize him at all. He lost so much weight and looked fit. We were overweight while dating but he shed his cheek fat and more tight fitting clothes. Apparently, during the last box out, the guys got him a gym membership and he really dove in after leaving me and has been religiously going since.

I decided to ask about what I did to him. I told my friend that my therapist wants me to understand how my actions (in this case, my boxing out) affected him. What I heard made me feel even worse. Apparently, he started getting more apologetic over the smallest things (one example she gave was that he brought less food to a potluck than the others and started apologizing over and over). Then he started binge drinking sporadically. He told his friends that it was to ""cope with work stress"" but I really know (and they all know now) that we had been fighting. One night of binge drinking, one of the other guys was commenting how he had a minor squabble with his girlfriend over not liking The Notebook and that set my ex off. He had a full on mental breakdown and basically spilled out everything I had done to him at this point. 

That's when they turned on me. When I boxed him out, they would let him text me once and basically try to distract him while taking his phone away until he stopped trying to panic apologize. Then they started to tell him that he was being abused and to leave me. That was before the second time he asked me to change. They wanted him to leave me then but he insisted that I would change. Then the final time he agreed with them and gave them explicit instructions to block my number and delete my contact info when he gave the signal. However, he told my friend that she was free to do whatever she wanted. He said he wasn't going to kill a friendship over his problems.

Then he left and then the wall of silence came up.

I wish I'd never asked. I wish I thought about what he was going through. I had my head so far up my ass that I thought I was right and self-absorbed in my world where he was wrong and I was right and he deserved that punishment. 

Anyways, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] off now. I won't be using this account again. Thank you for all of your support and making me see the hard things. I'll continue with my therapy and hopefully find someone who treats me as well as my ex did.",1656
18y2m8e,1704337738.0,2024-01-04 03:08:58,self,My dad and I should have died yesterday.,"My dad was driving me to the airport yesterday around 4:30am. It takes about an hour for us to get there from our house. We were driving on the highway over a bridge and around 40mins in I looked to the right and see 5 police cars just sitting around an intersection by a gas station. My dad was driving in the passing lane because he’s a faster driver and because there were more cars around us from crossing 210. The road curved to the right ahead. He noticed a guy coming up behind him and he switched lanes. I thought about how he usually drives faster when it gets more busy and that this was uncharacteristic of him. I had another thought about the right lane and it was that if I was driving in this moment I would also move over. I then turned to look back at the flashing cop lights near the gas station that previously had my attention. Not even 2 seconds pass from changing lanes and there’s this really loud sound that zips by us from the left and then it’s followed by a big boom. I turn around to look at what has happened and as i’m starting to turn around my dad turns to me with the most distraught face I have ever seen. He said to me “Did you see that? Did you see that?” very quickly and loudly in a really high voice. His breathing was very fast and he seemed to be panicking. I could tell he was distressed but then I saw that his hand was holding his heart and that’s when I was starting to panic. I have never in my life seen my dad this shaken or distraught ever. I’m telling him that it’s alright, it’s ok, just keep driving and while i’m trying to calm him down I see police cars flying by on the other side of the highway. I was still confused but then what my dad said to me next made me come to a realization. He said very seriously, while staring right at me, “The person behind us just died.” 

What he said struck me to my core. I felt paralyzed and felt everything stop around me for a few seconds when he told me that. It was hard to look away from him because all I saw in his eyes was fear. In a weird way I felt safe while looking at him because it felt like it was only us in that moment with nothing going on around us. As soon as I look back I see the leftovers of fire and smoke from a collision that had just happened. That safety I felt was destroyed in a matter of seconds. The car that was right behind us was hit head on by someone who was driving the wrong way on the highway in the lane we were just in. If my dad hadn’t switched lanes at the time he did then we would have died immediately. After processing all of this, I started to cry. I didn’t know whether to feel lucky or grateful or guilty or sad. I didn’t know what I was feeling but it was all too overwhelming for me. All I could do was cry. It’s really scary to think that both of our lives could have been ended so quickly. It was a very humbling experience that I can’t stop thinking about. I keep feeling like it should have been us and that I don’t deserve this. I honestly still don’t know what to think about it but I can’t stop thinking about it. 

Also, I never remember my dreams but I do remember the occasional nightmares I have. Exactly 1 week before this, I had a nightmare where I ended up dying in a car crash from a head on collision. I’ve heard that you can’t die in your dreams but it really felt like I did. Everything went black as soon as I was hit. I woke up terrified covered in sweat and I couldn’t believe that I was still alive. I looked over at the clock and it was 4:29am. 

I feel like I was meant to die because I can totally see myself dying in that moment. I keep imagining me and my dad dying together and every detail of it. Even though I haven’t experienced getting married or having a family I feel satisfied with my life up to this point. I just feel like I should have died. I just don’t know what to think but I feel truly blessed. My dad told me after, that he heard a voice tell him to move lanes. My grandpa passed away a few months ago so I like to think that he protected us. I still cry anytime I am [REDACTED_NAME] of him because I’m really bad at saying goodbyes. They are always too hard for me and I always cry even if i’m just saying goodbye after visiting family on a road trip. I feel grateful for the time I got with him and for the opportunity I got today. I will not waste the chance I was given. 

I’m sorry if this is confusing I didn’t have anyone to talk to about this because I had to get on a plane after and I didn’t know what to do. I had to get it out somehow because I kept crying. Thank you for reading this and listening to my story.

We were the last car he went by.

This is just a story. It's really difficult discussing racism because everyone feels different. The reason I wrote this is because this was an important experience to my life that I can relate to. That's all. 

Last edit: I am [REDACTED_NAME] longer going to respond to this post due to not respecting the first edit. The only reason I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it up is for the people who do appreciate my story. If you dont, please down vote and move along. It's quite obvious that racism with Sheriff Joe is a big issue. And if you have lived there for blah blah blah how many years, and you claim to have seen no racism, you're just in denial. The only place I've seen it comparable was Buffalo. Enjoy the thread or dont. I could care less.

This is going to be a long story. Buckle up buckeroos. http://m.imgur.com/VGijMZX

So for anyone who missed one of the top posts yesterday about the man who spent 4 years in jail for plotting to kill Sheriff Joe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Arpaio#Munnell_memo

Link of the story,  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] mobile otherwise I would try and link the actual post for referance. My computer is broken at the moment which would make this 1000 times easier to provide the OC of the thread. And as a warning, this is definitely about my perspective as a white person on racism. http://makeagif.com/CZ2nhf 

Honestly I don't care about race. It's never phased me. I could care less what color somebody's skin is. But I also fully admit that I don't know what it's like to be another race. There was a point where I was the only white kid in my class for [REDACTED_ADDRESS]raight when I lived in Buffalo, but nobody treated me different. I was too young to notice anything. And i think everyone else was too young to to care about anything like that.

Throughout the comments, the most reoccuring subjects were other horrible things he has done, and people asking ""How the fuck does this guy get re-elected?"" Last time I checked the guy has been elected 6 times in a row. 

Here is my story of how I packed my bags in a day, my experience with the different races of people I met, and why I left Phoenix, Arizona.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] living in one of the larger cities in Iowa. It really isn't all that bad there compared to a lot of other places, and if you don't live in the country, generally everyone gets along pretty well. Racism is really not a huge issue here. People seem to get along fine and are pretty tolerant. I can't speak for every single person, but it's not a common as where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] from. Originally I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Buffalo, NY. Racism runs insanely deep there. Cross the wrong train tracks or bridge, and risk getting stabbed to death. At minimum get jumped for being white/black in either races respective nieghborhoods. For anyone who isn't aware, nieghborhoods in Buffalo are extremely segregated, and I think it's gotten a little better, but not by much.

After a nasty break up, I decide there isn't anything left here for me and I decided my new life was out west. I ended up running into my ex girlfriend on St Paddy's day that same year. For someone who I was best friends and lovers with for 7 years, she was completely cold to me. It really struck me very deep. I remember going home and crying for about [REDACTED_ADDRESS]raight (I was completely sober) until I passed out. I woke up the next day, looked around and realize all my shit reminded me of her. Even my car, we bought together, and it was on it's last legs.

I had a friend in Phoenix who had been asking me to come live with them. I think they were pretty lonely and didn't have any friends. I called him up and told him I would see him in a couple days. He was very excited. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/xScBaNX

I put all my stuff on Craigslist for sale except for my smaller personal belongings. I took my car down to the dealership, traded it in for a much better car. At this point my phone is blowing up from the Craigslist ad I threw up. I sold all but one item in about a 3 hour time span. After I took the ad down, I called my friends and let them know I was leaving on short notice and if they wanted to see me, well that night was the night. I was actually suprised how many people showed up, considering I felt lonely constantly at that point in my life. Usually everyone was too busy. It was a Friday night so I guess it worked out.

6 A.M. the next morning, I hit the road. 35 very enduring hours and 2 days later, I arrived in Maricopa which is about 20 minutes south of Phoenix smack dab in the middle of the desert.

My new roomate hooked me up with a print job next to the Phoenix airport. So I started working and meeting people fairly quickly. 

I remember the 2nd day I was in AZ, my roomate sat me down and was like ""Okay dude. Things are different here. You have to understand that people here can be really hostile. People get shot on the highways all the time for even honking their horn at other people. You also need to make sure you don't get lost and end up in the wrong nieghborhood."" The entire time I was thinking that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Buffalo, and am very aware of how dangerous it could be, so I brushed it off.

It didn't take me long to figure out that I was definitely the minority. At least that's what it seemed like. Not a big deal. I was always good at making friends. Growing up, my father was always moving us around every 6 months or less. I think I went to at least 15 different schools growing up between New York, Florida, South Carolina, and Iowa. Making friends fast was no issue.

I'm a smoker, and everyone seemed like they smoked cigarettes. At least everyone came outside on break to chit chat. I ended up making some friends right away. One guy in particular. His name was Jose and he was in a death metal band. He invited me to some of his practices, which happened to be in the small town I was living in. So I made friends which a group of Mexican dudes within a week. They were real funny guys, never treated me different until I went to his first show. 

I ended up getting completely fucking shit faced hammered by the end of the night. I had a lot of pent up energy, and got a little too wild. But I remember one of the guys I was regularly hanging out with kind of avoiding me. I realized pretty quickly that he didn't want his friends to see he was hanging out with someone who was white. So I just went and hung out with the guy I worked with. We ended up going down to the gas station because we were both hungry. 

We sat down on the curb and started talking. I told him that his friend was avoiding me and asked him if it was because I was white. He kind of paused and said ""yeah, probably"". When I asked him why he told me that they're used to white people being really racist towards them. He said he could tell that I didn't seem like a person who didnt gave a shit, but it didn't change how things were. We also got on the subject of voting and he told me it doesn't matter. He said no one he knew voted because it didn't change anything. 

I can't completely say that my experience with hearing that a specific group of Mexicans believed voting didn't change anything, so they just didnt vote meant that's how all of the Hispanic people of Arizona felt. But I got the feeling it was a strong indication that was what was going on. It's not even a race thing. It's a poverty thing. Even my poor white friends don't believe it changes anything. It's just a lack of hope, and people's dreams were crushed by economic slavery long ago. That's just my observation anyways. 

One of my previous roomates was currently living pretty close to where I was in North Phoenix, so I ended up cabbing it back to his apartment. I came back the next day and my driver side window was smashed out. I was so pissed, I never had anything happened to my car like that before. He just looked at me and said ""Dude you left your car in a Mexican nieghborhood. What did you think was going to happen?"" I was pretty shocked because I had known the guy for 10 years almost and have never heard him say anything like that. I think he could tell I was sort of judging him by the way I was looking at him. ""Dude, that's just how it is here.""

Having that window broken almost got me killed. I got really lost and ended up 45 minutes in the wrong direction. I ended up grabbing a galling of water from a gas station. It was 127 degrees out that day. No matter how much I drank, it felt like I was sweating it out. I ended up pulling over 4 times because I got light headed.

I decide to focus more on work and started keeping more to myself after that. As I drive on the 10 everyday, I start to actually notice how many police there are. I mean, it's definitely a huge city, but these cops looked like they were carrying military grade shit. They all had huge SUVs (I don't think I saw an actual car the entire time I was there, all trucks). I saw some with assault rifles just chilling in their passenger seat if they were alone. It was really unnerving. I could have seen things wrong, I was driving after all. But they definitely let their presence be known. 

After a few months I begin to get lonely. So I downloaded Tinder and decided maybe going on some dates or something would cheer me up. To be honest I was hoping to meet a cutie Mexican 3.14. But all the girls that would match with me are white. I guess it wasn't that weird when I thought about it. I suppose in my own mind when I thought about the future, and having a family, I always envisioned my wife being white for some reason. Don't get me wrong, I would much rather have an Asian wife or something. So it made sense that other white girls would be going after a white guy. 

I ended up matching up with a girl who lived about 2 miles away from me. We talked and decided to meet up at her place. She lived with her dad. So we sat outside on the tailgate of her pick up truck and just talked. I could tell pretty much right away it wasn't going work becsuse she started bitching about how the Mexicans were taking all the jobs and that her dad couldn't make a proper wage because of it. I brushed it off because I wasn't sure if what she was saying wasn't a legitimate complaint. Was this guy getting fucked over? I didn't know, so I reserved my judgement. Probably because I was really desperate for companionship. I remember her bringing up Sheriff Joe. 

Right away, I was like ""that guy is a fucking murderer and should be put in prison for life for the terrible things he's...."" and before I could even really begin to rant, she shushed me. 

I was a bit suprised when she said ""uhm, you're in the wrong nieghborhood for that. Don't let anyone hear you. Honestly if my dad heard you say that, he would probably come out and kick your ass. You don't know what its like here. We never feel like we're safe. We have to compete to get jobs at lower wages because businesses don't care and want to spend as little as possible. He is the only one who is standing up and doing anything about it. Why do you think he's been re-elected 6 times?""

I was telling her about what it was like back home and about how I grew up and some of my friends. I told her my best friend was black. Her immediate response was ""ew your best friend is a nigger?"" I was completely shocked and that desperation for companionship melted away immediate. 

My immediate response was ""Excuse me? That so called ""nigger"" is my best friend. We've had our ass beat together, we've starved together. When I was out on the streets at 16, this guy barely knew me, and he taught me how to survive. He's more family to me then my actual family. You know it's not okay to be racist right?""

""Uhm actually yeah it is"" she said.

I didn't even hesitate. I just got up and got in my car and left. She sent me a message about 5 minutes after I got home saying she was sorry if she offended me. I told her that nothing was ever going to be fixed if you continue walking down the path of hate your father has so obviously laid before you. She didn't respond after that.

Unfortunately, that wasn't my last experience with racism. I noticed the more white people I met, the more I didn't like white people. I started to even feel ashamed of being white because I realized everyone viewed me like them. That I was this white dude full of hate, when i wasnt. This caused a lot of doubts in my mind if this was the place for me. 

It just kept continuing in this circle. Hear all the hate. Seeing all the cops. Watching the news and seeing all the people get murdered for such stupid reasons. Watching cops get away with murder. Seeing people pulled over and were almost always black or hispanic. Realizing that a huge portion the population was just old white people from all over moving to the surrounding areas and those were the people who were voting this guy in. And they love him! They think because he is so extreme that he's keeping the white people safe.

My roomate and I agreed that around the 6 month mark, I would find my own place.  I didn't want to live in a place that was at war with itself. It felt a lot like I was living in some midevil story where all the white people were the nobles and everyone else was just a peasant getting fucked over constantly by ""King Joe's"" men. 

Packed my shit and moved back east. 

As a side note, I have a friend who got a DUI and had to go to tent city. She was there for a month. She said it was like torture. They kepts her in tents, didn't feed her, didn't supply water in 130 degree weather until she was on the brink of passing out. Then they would nurse her back to health and then start the cycle again. She said she would never even step foot in AZ again. 

This was just my experience, everyone's life is different and experiences different things at different times. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to offend anyone here. If your from Arizona and love living there, great for you. Personally I loved the architecture and the music culture. But I just never felt safe there. Like everyone was the enemy. I thought about getting a gun since its so ridiculously easy. But my biggest fear was that I would have to use it. Either die in the process, or feel the guilt of killing someone else, even if it was self defense.

So I left, and I won't come back.

TL;DR-Lived in Phoenix, saw a circle of hate and fear, combine that with old people retiring and living there, that's how you get Sheriff Joe.",273
1f89lqc,1725393380.0,2024-09-03 19:56:20,self,One of my stories,"***EDIT: RELATIONSHIP CHANGES MADE***

I had a life changing moment this Saturday and Sunday and need to share it with someone. I typed this up and ran it through ChatGPT for editing so it comes out all storytelly like. Sorry it reads like a book, but this is my true story.


       When I was between 8 and 15 years old, my dad, who sexually abused me during that time (a crucial detail for later context), would have our family participate in what he called a ""Eulogy."" One person would lie face down on the floor, covering their face, and wasn’t allowed to talk—only listen. My dad would start with, “Here lies *insert name*. [Blah blah blah wootuh wootuh woo] Would anyone like to say a few words about the deceased?” Then, myself and the rest of the family—my mom, dad, and seven siblings—would take turns sharing three things they liked about the ""dead"" person and three things they didn’t like.

       I remember vividly my first time, at 8 years old, lying there with my face hidden, listening as my entire family listed everything they disliked about me, unable to defend myself. With my AuDHD, my memory recall was poor; I couldn’t remember a single positive comment they made. What stood out was how many struggled to find three things they liked about me.

       I cried silently on the floor, trying to be discreet. Afterward, we were supposed to thank everyone for the positive feedback and apologize for the negative. But I couldn’t recall everything that was said—many complaints were repeated, but specific details slipped my mind. I ended up offering a generic apology and quickly getting out of the way. We did this at least five times, often unexpectedly. Each time, I would forget most of the criticisms but still end up crying as I heard my family express their dislike over and over again.

       As I got older, I drifted apart from my siblings and parents for various reasons. My dad is a clear-cut case due to the sexual, emotional, and psychological abuse. My mom’s involvement is more complicated; she knew about the abuse, but being the passive-aggressive, nonconfrontational person that she is, she allowed it to continue for an extra year out of her love for him. Some of my siblings encouraged me to maintain a relationship with my dad, despite knowing the truth at the same time as my mom did. Other siblings and family members drifted away for different reasons.

       I never questioned why they didn’t make more effort to stay in touch with me. Reflecting on it now, I realize I believed they all disliked or hated me anyway. Their ""love"" felt obligatory, merely because we were siblings and had grown up together. The Eulogies they participated in had repeatedly told me why they would leave if they could, and I was never able to defend myself or remember what to correct and improve.

       This led me to develop a character complex. I couldn’t tolerate any attack on my character without immediately defending myself or correcting the situation, fearing that if I didn’t, I would forget the criticism and people would end up hating or avoiding me.

       The moment I heard any critique, I would immediately swoop in to ""fix"" it. I’d seek clarity, offer my perspective, and apologize if I was genuinely at fault. I felt compelled to address issues right away to avoid forgetting them later. This urgency extended even to situations where I wasn’t the main topic of discussion but my name was mentioned negatively or inaccurately.

       I couldn’t leave things unresolved, fearing that people would start to dislike me. Unfortunately, my approach wasn’t always gentle. I would interrupt, dominate conversations, place blame on others, and dismiss their feelings. Although I never lied, gaslit, or manipulated intentionally, my actions—rooted in understanding their feelings and my own insecurities—often left people feeling that their emotions were less important than my need to defend myself.

       Passive, non-confrontational people had little chance around me. I became a monster, an ice queen, cold-hearted, and abusive—traits that starkly contrasted with who I am [REDACTED_NAME] of these damaging interactions. While I am [REDACTED_NAME] described as loving, caring, kind-hearted, and selfless, those qualities seemed lost in the heat of the moment.

       Assertive people, whether confrontational or not, would confront me directly. They weren’t intimidated by my defenses and called out my behavior. Unfortunately, their feedback often felt foreign to me, as if we were speaking different languages. I struggled to understand their perspectives, feeling as though they were speaking Spanish while I only understood English.

       I ended a three-year relationship with my girlfriend/fiancée because she was too afraid to communicate with me and wouldn’t explain her feelings. Five months before the final breakup, I had ended things because I was constantly upset with her and felt she didn’t deserve an angry partner. I needed space to figure things out, but she struggled to give me that space. I told her it was about me, not her, and that I would come back if she was still willing to have me. During this time, I realized that her timidness, similar to my mother's, triggered me. I shared this realization with her, but it only angered and offended her. We hadn't resolved this issue, and though I hadn’t found a way to manage my anger, I hoped we could work through it together.

       She reluctantly took me back, but things changed; she only spoke to me when absolutely necessary and didn’t show any affection. It was painful to hear her express love and insist everything was fine while she wouldn’t show it. I watched her interact normally with others but not with me. After five months, I couldn't continue and decided to end the relationship again. This time, I framed it as a matter of incompatibility rather than faults on either side. I am [REDACTED_NAME] and assertive, and she is passive and non-confrontational. I told her I was open to trying again if things changed.

       Looking back, I see she loved who I was outside of our conflicts. She was afraid of losing me, so she stayed quiet, walked on eggshells, and lied to keep the peace. Today, she views me as her first abusive relationship and believes she’s better off without me. She considers what happened unforgivable, and I’m not worth salvaging. I've vowed to avoid relationships with people like her in the future. Even after this self-discovery, I still feel this way. If someone can’t communicate their feelings or help me understand what I can’t see in myself, how can I ever become who they need me to be?

       I am [REDACTED_NAME] and blessed to have a person in my life (32M) who loves me, flaws and all, and shows it at every opportunity. He loves me enough to keep trying, again and again, to help me understand myself, never giving up—or at least finding other solutions that bring us back to peace and love. When it came to expressing how I often put my feelings before his (my character complex), it was like he was speaking a foreign language to me. But he never gave up. It was as if he eventually learned to translate everything into English or faught tooth and nail to teach me Spanish, so to speak.

       I finally understand! Because of his true love for me, I was able to work on myself and become a better person. I love him enough to conquer my fears and put in that work. I cried for hours, delving deep into my past, my emotions, my mentality, and my trauma. I connected the dots, found the reasons behind my behavior, and was disgusted with myself. Had I really done this to people all these years? I had been so afraid of having my character attacked that I ""protected"" my reputation at the expense of their emotional needs. I was devastated, to say the least. I spent so much time and energy trying to prove I wasn't the kind of monstrous person they described that I was blind to the monster I had become over the years.

       I came to my two loves (at the time of this post we had another partner that is no longer in the picture) and apologized for how I had treated them over the years. I promised to change and acknowledged how difficult it must have been for them to deal with me. I even reached out to a few of my exes and apologized to them. Unsurprisingly, I was ignored, but I still felt it was important to try.
 
       The very next day, I got the chance to prove myself to my loves. The three of us were lying in bed together when an old issue resurfaced—one of many that I had thought was resolved but that my fiancé couldn’t seem to let go of. As she spoke to my husband, I listened in frustration, feeling like she was unfairly picking at me and spreading those opinions to others, all while hurting herself by holding onto past problems that I believed were of her own making. In my head, I was defensive, but outwardly, I stayed quiet.

       When she finished, I quickly sat up, needing time to think. She tried to comfort me by caressing my face, but I angrily swatted her hand away without thinking. It was unintentionally harsh, but I was focused on my growth in that moment and couldn’t risk losing concentration. All they could do was quietly hold each other and wait patiently for me to be ready.

       It took me five minutes of silence to compartmentalize all the hurt from what felt like ""verbal attacks"" on my character, to push away the excuses and defenses, and to translate what she said from ""Spanish"" to ""English"": she was sad because she didn’t feel like I was there for her emotionally when she needed me. She wasn’t blaming me or calling me a bad person. She simply wanted me to understand her feelings and show that I cared about them. She wanted me to validate her emotions.

       I realized that I didn’t need to admit to any accusations or verify whether I did or said the things she claimed. I just had to care that she was hurting. I took a couple of deep breaths and looked her in the eyes. I sincerely apologized for not recognizing her needs sooner. I apologized for not giving her the support she needed in the way she needed it at the time. I promised to do better.

       She thanked me and asked for a hug, but I quickly said no and turned away. I curled up in a fetal position on the bed, staring into space as a horror movie played in my head: ""When can I explain myself? When is it appropriate for me to defend my actions and words? Do I even remember what she said about me? I can't remember everything... Does that mean I can't fix it? I can't fix their perception of me. They're going to hate me! They're going to hate me, and it's their fault because they wouldn't let me talk! If they just let me explain myself, I could have fixed all this, but they wanted me silenced while they berated me like in the eulogies!""

       Flashes of destructive thoughts filled my mind: jumping out of bed and throwing the TV to the floor, slamming the fan into the wall, or even turning back to the bed and attacking/harming the two of them. In that moment, I felt like only people who supported things like the vile things that plagued my childhood would put me through a ""eulogy"" again, would silence me like this. Suddenly, I felt a warm weight on my body.

       My husband and fiancé were holding and comforting me. They whispered calming words and wiped my tears. I didn’t even realize I was crying. I didn’t know I was hyperventilating until my breathing slowed, or that I hadn’t blinked in who knows how long until I finally did. In that moment, my two loves gave me everything I needed before I even knew I needed it. They showed me that no matter what they've heard, no matter who said it, they’ll still love me. They might believe some of the bad things about me, but to them, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it. They showed me that they believe the good in me outweighs the bad by immeasurable amounts.

       When I realized this, I cried so hard in their arms. Once I calmed down, I thanked them and told them everything that had gone through my mind. They smiled at me with so much love and care in their eyes and promised to be patient with me as I navigate this new self-discovery.

       In that moment, I truly understood what it meant to be loved unconditionally. My husband didn't just accept me; be embraces every part of me, even the parts I struggled to accept myself. His patience and unwavering support became the foundation upon which I could rebuild my understanding of myself and our relationship. Together, we will move forward, stronger and more connected, knowing that even in our darkest moments, we could rely on each other for light. I now realize that growth isn’t about perfection but about progress, and with him by my side, I know I can continue to grow into the person I want to be.

              Thank you for listening.

clm5ab,1564857435.0,2019-08-03 18:37:15,self,"I am almost gone, just tell my story in a nutshell","Hello reddit. I am 24 M, the location is Eastern Europe.

Sorry for my bad english, i did not study it

I'll start from the beginning

I was born in a small village in the most ordinary family of hard workers. Father constantly disappeared at work, mother was at home, doing housework. I can’t say that I had a perfect childhood - I had to work hard, and I could only dream of a trip to the sea or at least to some kind of amusement park.

I practically did not communicate with my father all my life, starting from childhood - he was almost all the time at work, and ending today - we were never at least somehow close. Fortunately, we had a warm relationship with my mother at least at that far time.

I don’t know why, but since childhood I was very closed to myself. I did not communicate with classmates and neighboring children, spending free time with books, which is why I came across as strange

More, in general, I did not stand out. I studied normal at school - i could, of course, study well and even excellently, but either my parents didn’t tell me why this was necessary, or I didn’t understand it myself - it's hard to say.

When I was 7 years old, I was hit by a car. Right next to the school on a break, we ran to a store nearby. The drunk driver was faster than me. Torn ligaments on the leg, concussion, cracked ribs and many minor bruises. About a month I spent at first in the hospital, then at home, and when I returned to school I became even more clear of people

Several years passed without any special incidents, until at 13 my parents decided to send me to the sanatorium for a month - after the car hit me, my health constantly left much to be desired. I was often and hard sick, so my parents decided that a month there would be useful for me

And it was just a nightmare. Imagine that you are an absolute introvert who, like a snail, was pulled out of a shell and thrown somewhere. It was a terrible month. Once in a company of [REDACTED_ADDRESS]rangers, I finally shut myself down. But if everyone in the native village got used to it, then there it resulted in insults and humiliations, to which I could not oppose anything.

When I returned home, my parents noticed that something was wrong with me, but I just could not tell them what was happening, answering their questions “everything is fine” This answer, of course, did not satisfy them. So they decided to send me for further training at the Lyceum, which was located in the regional center.

At first, everything was not so bad, but over time the story from the sanatorium repeated. I was the very person with whom everyone laughed, who was bullied. Regular beatings, humiliations. I don’t know for what reason I could not admit to anyone about it, but it lasted a year and a half. It ended up just swallowing pills. But since I’m writing all this, you can understand that i was saved

After that, my parents took me back to the village and simply sent me to another school. Further, surprisingly, it was better. After about half a year, I somehow found a common language with classmates. In the last year of school, I even started dating a girl, which lifted me morally to unprecedented heights, it seemed that everything was starting to get better.

After leaving school, she and I went to study in the same city (and I even managed to enter a budget place), so we spent a lot of time together. With sadness and warmth I remember that time, the best time in my life. But, it lasted three years, and then she became pregnant. It makes no sense to explain that two students with minimal work would not have mastered creating a family with a child, so I decided to take an academic leave at the university and go to a construction to make money.

A few months of work, a little rest, a few more months of work. As a result, I earned enough money so that we could not need anything for some time. Having returned home, I rented an apartment in the same city and started looking for work, and we agreed with the girl that she would stay with her mother this time, and after giving birth we would start living together

In general, everything went wrong. I got a job, she stayed with her mother. Then she gave birth to a son. It is difficult to describe my condition at that moment. On the one hand, I realized that I was only 21 years old, and this is too early. On the other hand, I knew that we could handle it and everything would be fine but no. After giving birth, she refused to go to me, arguing that she was too hard. Despite the fact that I then worked 6 days a week, there was still time after work in any case to help her in everything. I hinted at it, but was not heard.

She asked me to give her another week until she bounced back. Then another week. Then again. I came to them on their only day off, and on the same day I returned to the city, because I had to work. In the end, I was sent to fuck out. Seriously. I still remember her words ""You are not interested in making it easier for me, you don’t understand that if I move, it will be very difficult for me while you are at work, and here my mother helps me. You are not a man because you don’t think about me.""

Uhh damn 

This is still the most fucked up event in my life, the most unexpected, incomprehensible, unjustified. After that, I broke off all contacts and spent about half a year in the company of beer and a computer, as well as occasionally the only friend who visited me and jokingly asked if I would kill myself 

In the end, I tried to make contact with my ex. Not for the sake of a relationship, for the sake of a son. He was sent both by her and her mother, and even her sister, whose husband promised to beat me if I do not calm down.

Then everything went awry. I recovered at the university, but I could not continue my studies because of laziness (or is it procrastination? It doesn’t matter) - I was expelled after half a year. I changed a dozen works - I didn’t stay anywhere longer than a couple of months, it all ended up with me just quitting, living on the remaining money for a while, looking for a new job - repeat, repeat, repeat After a while, everyone who tried to support me - and it was my parents and friend - waved a hand at me, wrote off. No hobbies, no loved ones, no purpose in life, nothing. And I myself am nothing and nobody.

It is strange to realize how during all these events I constantly lied to everyone. I lied to my relatives that I would pack up and get out of this hole. I lied to the few people with whom I talked that this was the last time, and then I would pull myself together and cope, get out of this hole. Lied to myself about the same. But did nothing.

And all this time I imagined what would have happened if I had done something. Seriously, I imagined that I had not parted with the former, that everything was fine with us. That I graduated, found a normal job, became a normal person. He built in his head the scripts “what if I did ...” There was some way out in this, after such thoughts I felt better. Although the last 4 years have been extremely terrible in every sense.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] tired of this existence. Yesterday I was left without housing, there was money left for a few days, when they end - I will leave this place

It is surprising that only after I made this decision for myself I feel pacified

If someone has read this and wants to ask a question, I will answer with pleasure.",16
eu6mod,1580044943.0,2020-01-26 13:22:23,self,My story about how I turned from an obsessed Fan to a depressed hater (Very long message),"Hello. I am [REDACTED_NAME] germany and recently turned 24 years old. There is something that happened to me a time ago, and, even though this story may be very boring, I want to share it. This goes especially to younger people who are somebody's Fan. Because everyone thinks being a fan is a great thing that makes you happy. But at least for me, that was not the case. There was a pressure, an addiction. It almost ruined me. That's why I want to share my story, I want to show you how wrong it can go. and that it can be dangerous to get addicted to a person. When you're somebodys Fan, you create a different version of that person in your head. Your imagination is ALWAYS different from what is real, because at first you only know their image or what you think it is. Then you fill up everything else with how you want it to be. It is so clear this can only be a lie. So now i want to share this message especially for younger people, so they open their eyes. I don't hope anyone else makes similar experiences like i did, the greatest thing would be if i can prevent someone from going through the same. I have never told this anyone, not even my parents know I was Fan and everything after. So here's a story of my youth , a secret that will maybe define me for the rest of my life:

Everything started a long time ago. I was still a child. Only 9 years old. I started to discover music on the radio. I liked a lot. But I was fascinated by one voice and a song I absolutely loved. They finally mentioned the artists name on the radio. (I forbid his name now!) Later I got more songs (like 5)  from radio and I liked them all. I really liked his voice. I did not know who he was, if he was a band, how old he was, and who he really is. But I wanted more, I wanted to know every Song. So I asked my parents about who it was. 

As my Mom mentioned he’s there since the 80s and must be like 40, I was a little surprised, but I didn’t care. A year later, in 2007, I was 11 at that point,- I discovered another radio station. They had a Radiocomedy about this singer. I LOVED it! So, this is how I became a Fan. I started collecting every song I could get. And newspaper articles, mentions in the radio, Tv gigs, interviews… really EVERYTHING! I was obsessed with that singer! Well, at least with what I thought what he was. In my young brain, I made him to something very different than he was in real. And I never thought that there might be something wrong with him. No child or teen comes to the idea, that their Idol could do or say something they don't like. At least I did not. I created my own version of him in my head without even noticing it. This is something a lot Fans do, and it is dangerous! You'll see why. First shocking things for me as an ongoing (wannabe) fangirl: Hearing an old song. I never liked it. I couldn’t recognize one of my favorite singers. But well, this song is so old, I didn’t care much. Another shocking thing was when some radioguy said he would be a band. I was like WTF he is uninformed and takling shit - who’s the fan here, right? … I created a picture of a singer that doesn’t really exist. I remember I imagined stories… Anyway, this should stay with me for many many years … I remember when I was 12 he won some price and it came on Tv, but very late, I couldn’t watch it because the other day was school. Man, I cried so hard that night! That was how important it was to me. … When I was 13 I got my first Laptop and Internet. Then it started going really worse. I did nothing else than googling that singer! I found so many songs on youtube. So many new things. The addiction really began! … I didn’t mind if a song, or the half of them, was bad,- there were so many I had to discover. I was so obsessed. Way more than about other artists i always liked. I was collecting and collecting…. 

When I was 14 I had a really very hard time. I was bullied at school. I felt ugly, wrote bad marks. I had a teacher who always made me down. And I had no friends at all. I Had noone, I was lonely. So I needed something to hold on. Being the Fan was something that distracted me from reality. I had something to hear and watch on my laptop. I imagined stories, I made my own, better truth. I didn’t realize it back then. … I edited all the articles because i didn’t like it that way. I built castles in the air and matched everything the way i wanted. Online I also found a Fan Community, in which I instantly had to get in. So I learned how the ""real Fans"" are. Most of his Fans were Housewifes in their mid 40s, drooling over his look, knowing all the dirty details, loving the 80s stuff, hating the new music. Talking just about a band. And then there was me. A 14 year old girl, who highly prefered the newer songs and had totally different views and taste.  

And what I had to read and experience there for the next 2 years was not pretty! I really hoped to finally find people who like me and a place where i belong. But all they did was not taking me serious. “You are just a dumb teen, you don't know""… how ofted did I have to read this… They hated about my favorite songs, Fans! I couldn\`t understand it. There also were so many fights between users. And I was always their favorite target. They told me I\`d have a bad taste and broken ears. They were rude and they insulted me i would be just a rebellious teen. What? No! All I ever wanted was to be included. I tried so hard, but they always disrespected me. I cried so many nights, really! In the end they kicked me out, forever. I haven't done something bad, I just was cyberbullied,- by people who had children in my age. I can't tell how this hurt me. I was 16 or 17 when it ended like that. My situation was the worst. Bullied at school for 6 Years, no friends, and finally a community that i wanted to belong to more than anything else disaccepted me and bullied me out.  It depressed me, but I kept hanging on to it. Later, somebody wrote me a Facebook message. I think I was 16, that guy was a few years older. I had a fanpage on facebook i was building up at that time. That guy who wrote messages to me SEEMED really nice. He told me he understands me. There was also a girl in my age who was really nice. We 3 build a chatgroup on fb. For more than a year we were chatting nearly everyday. They were also  fans, I could talk to them, it was nice. I THOUGHT they were my friends. They knew everything about me! That guy always pretended to me that we are soulmates and that he can't imagine life without me, bla bla… But then, he started to change. He started to tell rumors about that singer I never heard of. He had views that were… strange! He started to denigrate my favoritesongs too. I remember we had endless long discussions. He tried to tell me why my favoritesongs are bad. He told me things I didn't like, I didn't want to hear. I always told him to stop, i feel bad and it hurts. But he continued.  The other girl in the chat got more and more on his side. In the end We were in a fight. Finally that guy kicked me out and closed the group. I was so damn sad.  He later told me: “And someTHING like you wants to be a fan? Grow up out of your barbie world, your are dead to me.” I newer recieved a message that hurt me so much! …

Later when I was 17, I bought a real CD. I usually don't buy CDs. But I did it just to prove that I am a real Fan. I needed it. I think when you have to prove yourself to be a Fan, you're not a true Fan. …

When I was 17/18, things in my personal life got better. I was at a new school.  But on the other side the time of doubt started. Fandoubts. Thoughts like: Am I really a fan?, have I ever been a fan? Why can't I belong into this Fandom?, are the things true that they say? How did he (singer) mean ABC in Interview XYZ? And so on afflicted me so bad. I searched for 1000 answeres but I only found more and more questions! My mind started to evolve just around all that. I felt so helpless, unsure, worried and alone. In 2014 all I have seen was fans bitching around in the internet, trying to ruin my life. Then there were news about a collaboration with someone else I didn't like. I never thought it was possible. And the worst thing is, I was in holidays when these news came. It literally ruined my holidays, because it made my doubts stronger. I was so sad, angry and frustrated about everything!  Though everything was great in my life, I was really depressed. Depressed because of what some stupid Rockstar I normally couldn't care less about, maybe does. I made something part of my life that has nothing to do with my life. Really, I was so sick. I was addicted! I needed to know everything. All that was not how I wanted, depressed me. I could have been the happiest, but all i did was relying my luck on something that wasn't even real. … So, I also still had this Fanpage. I got creative. I edited Videos and Pictures. I created little cartoons and so on. I taught myself in software like Photoshop. I created alternate albumcovers, I even wrote articles. It was fun, well, until fan’s reactions came. They never recognized my work. They stole them and copied them all over the internet. Whenever I said that it was my edit, they only got rude, did not believe me and told me I don’t may claim it was “mine”. It frustrated me so much how many of my edits got stolen. Also my speachbubble-Jokes and cartoons were never appreciated. For me it was like an homage to the old Radiocomedy I loved so much. But I just got disrespectful messages of fans who didn’t understand it. In the end, I lost my enjoyment about everything I did there. I went on talking about my views and feelings. If it was why I like one song, if it was why I can’t understand why everybody still lives in the 80s and hates the newer songs which were my favorites, if it was a complaining of something I didn’t understand, if it was one of my doubts, or rumours I didn’t want to believe….. I wanted to talk to Fans, I wanted to have a nice community of people at my wavelength. But it never ever worked. All I recieved was hate! Right, on my own page! Again people told me that I’m dumb, have a bad taste, no knowlege, that I’m too young to be a fan…. They said go and get help. Hello? WHAT THE FUCK WAS I DOING RIGHT HERE?!?! Nobody even tried to understand and to help me out. All they ever did is making it harder!!!  The next and last place where I tried to find a place was Tumblr. And I have to say, on Tumblr, there are the most pervert Idiots I have ever seen. I could never understand those drooling over his look type of fans. Though I’m female I was never like that. They only think of sex all the time. There was not a single Fan blog I liked. So I tried to make the best one my own. At the beginning it was ok. But then they started insulting me again. I remember one day, they started pseudo including me after I complained how I was never accepted in this fandom. They started an introducing action, hell it was so stupid. The only answeres I got were rude, and they just got more together, excluding me. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore!

In early 2016, I was just turned 20, the bomb finally exploded. I watched an interview. I’ve seen it 100 times before. But there was one sentence I always missed. Maybe, cause my english wasn’t that good in the past. I heard him say something I couldn’t believe. So I googled it and digged a little deeper. I figured out it was true. It gave me explanations for so many things. I finally had to realize, that all of the things I never wanted to believe are true, that everything I always believed in and loved was not true. I realized many things that time. Also that many of them Fans were right, unfortunately. And that I am [REDACTED_NAME] biggest idiot. I feel still ashamed. I hated my self. But I started to hate the singer! What it all made me is really SICK! And depressive! All 2016 I was on a hate trip, and new songs couldn’t save me. The lyrics are crap anyway. If you ask me now, I’d say: He is not a band, but it also ain’t a singer. He is a business cooperation consisting of an asshole with a fake image! Yeah I finally realized what a unsympathic fake person he is. That made me hate him. He steals all of his songs. He pretends to be about the music, but in fact he is only a businessman who wants to make more and more money. He lies. He doesn’t pay taxes. He hates animals.. etc. I realized it all. And then in all my hurt there remained just pure rage. I was so angry. I started writing hate comments to reveal everything on his social media. I don't know how many fake accounts and bots I started, just to finally let my frustration out. So I found myself as the pure hater. The typical one with 0 selfconfidence and problems with myself. This went on for a year or so. Until I realized that it is not worth it. Because I just waste all my energy on something that isn't good for me. Because it was stuck in my head and i only got nasty comments. I hurt myself over again with it. I had also phantasies to steal all of his CDs in the next store, just to harm him.  It was so hard for me to let go of it! It was really like a drug addiction. I  now hated this singer, but i still couldn't miss any news. I still was googling all the time,- just to get more frustrated. I didn't think it was possible to live without it. How could I live a few weeks without news about him? I tried it often, but i could never stay away longer than 2 weeks. But everytime i came back, i realized how i just hurt myself. Every time i've seen him have success was like a punch in my face. Like, he does not deserve that at all, it is so unfair! It wasn't good for me at all to see all that! The periods of staying away slowly got longer. When I was 22 I finally made a cut. I downloaded everything new i could get without watching it before, just saved it. I put everything I had (Fanpictures, CDs, a 2TB HDD etc..) in a Box and locked it away. Not allowing myself to ever open it again! But I know If I'd ever want to, I could open it. I felt like an alcoholic in rehab! It was so hard for me to not deal with anything about that singer anymore. And I admit, I relapsed a few times, and I googled, or listened to a song. It made me feel bad every time. But as time passes by, it gets easier. Now I don't need it anymore and I'd say I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for almost 2 years right now. But I still wish he was dead, or at least not famous anymore. I still wish him anything bad, that he suffers the same as I did. I don't hear radio anymore, because I don't want to be reminded on this ever again. I really wish I could erase my whole youth. It might be over, but i'm [REDACTED_NAME] not completely over it. When I only see his face I still get rage. I have to keep myself away for the rest of my life. It's crazy how addicted you can be to a person, you don't even know and you don't even really like.  I had even big problems to find a job because i was never interested in something else than him… 

Thank god I’ve never been to a concert. There were times I wanted, but luckily I didn’t, because of my doubts. Every doubt has it’s reason. Now it's the best to never see anything about him again! 

What I learned from this is, that i never want to be a Fan of anything! Being a Fan is stupid, you forget how to think, you are blind and dumb. Atleast that was I. There are a few other musicans I sort of like and if i wanted I could choose to be a fan. But I don't ever allow myself to be any sort of Fan again. I don't want to be interested in any famous person. They are all the same. I've noticed so many similarities with others too. Now I sort of hate them all, I'ts just not my thing.  When ever i start to be interested in some musican, i keep reminding myself on how wrong it can go out. Today i can control it, i realize what i am [REDACTED_NAME] to do and stay away. I guess I've grown up. Now I just listen to what i like and I don't even want to know the artists anymore. Because now I understand, it was all my own fault, and it would have happened with any other singer too! I was lonely and needed some distraction. That's why i fell for this singer. He was just a psychological replacement for something that was missing in my life! I was a victim of myself. I already had big problems which lead to more problems. Not he was the asshole, not the other fans,- I was the asshole. I was the biggest asshole to myself and I didn't even notice it!

So kids, what do you learn from this? Never start being a Fan, especially not such an obsessed fake one like I was. It only causes problems and pain. And don't ever compensate something you don't have with something that ain't real.  Keep your eyes open, be self reflective and don't lose reality.

After all those years and almost 2 more years of staying away from it I want to say I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Maybe not completely healed but clean. I don't need it anymore and 2019 was the best year since a long time because i leaned how to live without it. And the best thing is: I got through alone, I got out without help! 

So, I don't know what answeres to expect. Maybe you experienced something similar, maybe this helped you? No, I guess probably you think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a crazy idiot who wrote a way too long text. And this is very true! So, I wish you have a great day, bye! :)",2
7u8qb7,1517390679.0,2018-01-31 09:24:39,self,I just realized I was drugged and rape by an another male,"Just like the tittle says, I am [REDACTED_NAME] coming to terms with the fact I was drugged and raped by my boss at a work Christmas party.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] looking for a place to get this off chest and so I am [REDACTED_NAME] my rape story to you reddit. I am a long time lurker and a first time poster. This is going to be a long story but I think you need to hear most of it to get the big picture. I am [REDACTED_NAME] any spelling mistakes and grammar errors. 

Here's my story:

I am a 28 year old male Canadian male. My boss is a 55ish year old male, who is a large former Persian wrestler. He is an immigrated from Iran and he came to Canada about 20ish something years ago. He was also former coach at a local college wrestling club. He is the owner of a health and wellness clinic and I am [REDACTED_NAME] marketing coordinator for it. 

 I have  always known I was drugged and  raped by him, but I choose to do nothing about it. It made me feel like shit just even thinking about it, so I kept trying to convince myself it didn't happen. I didn't want to face the fact I was rapped by another man. I couldn't believe that someone could do that to another person. The really sad part is that I still work for him and this happened  4 years ago(November  2014). 

This rape happened during a office Christmas party. It was the end of November in Canada and the weather conditions were pretty bad. We had  a few snow storms. But Ever year my boss would have a big office christmas party at his house. So there was 30+ people that show up at his mansion for the party. Everyone was drinking and mingling. I was expected to come early and help set up, so I did. So we partied, played secret santa and ate dinner. Now everyone started slowly leaving and I was one of few last one to leave. I had a few beers, so I decided to stay longer and make sure I had some hours between my last beer. I had about 4 beer through out 7 hours of being there. So it's was about 11-12ish(i don't remember the exact time) and I was leaving. But the my bosses house was in the mountain area, so you would have to go up and down though these winding roads to get there. And the road conditions were really bad that time of year. A huge storm had hit a few days earlier. It was below 0 that night and there was a lot of black ice and snow on the roads and I didn't have any winter tires. I was driving really carefully because of the road conditions . But My car hit some black ice and started sliding out of control. I wasn't moving fast or anything but my tires couldn't regain traction when I was sliding. I was pumping my break but it wasn't doing anything. So my car slowly slid off the side of the road and I got stuck and would need a towtruck to get me back on the road. 

I called a few towtruck places but they wouldn't come to my location in these weather conditions. So I decided to call my boss and see if there was anyone still at the party that could grab me because I was stranded. The area wasn't too far from my bosses place. So, he and his girlfriend ended up picking me up. I decided to leave my car there over night and call a tow-truck tomorrow  to get my car back on the road. My boss offered me to sleep over and take the guest bedroom, so I accepted. 

When I came back to his house, there was 2 other people from the party that were sleeping over because they came together and didn't want to risk driving in these conditions. They were still up and talking but I decided to go to sleep.  After my boss showed me my room, he came with a large glass of water and 2 pills. He told me to take it but I usually never take any pills so I refused. But he kept telling me to take it but I kept refusing. He wasn't backing down and I thought that was kind of weird that he kept insisting me to take them. Then he was like ""just take 1 then "" and I knew he wasn't backing down so I gave in and asked him what of pills these were. He said Tylenol and I remember myself looking very closely at the pills and it seemed like a Tylenol. So I finally gave in and ate 1, after having refusing to take  like them about 10 times before. And then I passed out. 

I remembered having this really fucked up dream that night where I was being held down but couldn't see, couldn't move and i was trying to speaking but couldn't. It felt like I was being held down and I was trying everything I could to move but still couldn't. I kept struggling and trying to move, until this weird sudden sensation (not exactly sure how to describe it. Somewhat like a thud or impact) and I remember after that my body just started relaxing after that. I remember that's the time I gave into it and quit trying to move. And then I woke up. 

I was feeling fucked up the next morning. My head was throbbing and my stomach was in pain. I was really confused and remembered not drinking too much and thought there's no way I should be hungover like this. This literally was the  worst hangover in my life, I thought. I also had this bruise on the back of my head, which was very tender when I touched it. I was trying to remember what the hell happened and how did I get it. I knew it couldn't be from my car accident because I was going so slow and it wasn't much of an accident. My car just slid off the road and got Stuck. I was in a lot pain and had no idea where it came from, But I just brushed it off and tried to forget about it. 

My bosses made breakfast for all 3 of us that morning. I couldn't eat anything because my head and my stomach was killing. This female work was really concerned about me and had this concerned look on her face. But I just told her was fine. And  I thanked and apologized to my boss for pick me up after my accident. 

 So after breakfast I called a tow truck company and told them the location of my car. My boss agreed to drop me off at my car so that the towtruck can pull my car back on to the road. When he was dropping me off to my car, he kept grabbing and rubbing is hand. I notice that and asked what happened to his hand, and he looked at me and gave me weird as fucken smile and just said that he had hurt it. I didn't think to much of it. 

I came home and I still live with parent, so I had to explain the whole story to them. My mom bitching me out but there wasn't much damage to the car, just cosmetic . But I knew that night wasn't right and there was something off about that night, but I still brushed it off. Throughout that day I kept remembering that night how my  boss kept insisting me to take those pills. This was when I started to suspect that I might have been rapped. I ran to my medicine cabinet looking for Tylenol but mine were different so I Google a bunch of tylenol pill images and none of them matched the one my boss gave me. I specifically remembering  the pill he gave me having a mini octagon pattern on the outside edge of pill and It didn't have any writing on it. So that when I pretty much knew I was rapped but I decided not to believe it. I kept trying to keep my mind away from it. 

After that day my boss started calling me George Michael.  He said that I look him and I was like wtf who's that. He told me he was a really good looking singer for 80's. I didn't think too much of it but I didn't know he was gay. After I found out that he was gay, I knew it was his fucked up way to say that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] bitch and that I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I've never been with a man and never would but I have nothing gay people. I felt like shit everytime he said that. He probably thought he was being sneaky and cleaver by saying that and I have no way of knowing what he did. I tried to get back at him by slacking off at work anytime i got. I would just do the bare basics and fuck off majority of the time. 

That girl that was concerned  about me during breakfast, got fired. And my boss kept trying to pit me again her. He kept saying she didn't want to pick me up that night and she told him to leave me out there. He kept calling her crazy and called her a drug addict. Im pretty sure he was trying to get me to hate her because she probably know what happened to me that night. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure at this time my boss knew that I found out that I was raped by him. I kept Googleing I was raped on my work computer and trying to find other people in similar situations. This is the first time me talking about this incident.I probably need to go to a therapist but I am [REDACTED_NAME] and can't afford it. My boss  would  bring up the accident from time to time, he kept trying to insist I was really drunk that day and I made a big mistake that night. I would say I wasn't drunk but he wouldn't care and kept accusing. But I just finally decided to say yes ""I was drunk and I'm [REDACTED_NAME]"" but that was just go shut him up. I now realize that he probably was recording that so he would have evidence if I ever try to accuse him of rape. There was a bunch of other incidents like this were it made me know for certain I was raped. My boss also knows a lot of lawyers and made it a point to make sure I knew that he has a bunch of cop friends as well. I am [REDACTED_NAME] and I have no idea how I could prove he raped me. So I didn't do anything and I didn't talk anyone about it. I felt alot of shame from it. I feel like a bitch and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] working for him. But I am 100% sure I was rapped that night.",19
4ss305,1468481983.0,2016-07-14 07:39:43,self,"I have been experiencing deep and physically painful sleep paralysis in addition to heavy lucid dreams since I was a child, here's my story I guess. [very long] [x-post /r/luciddreaming]","EDIT: I didn't specify in the title but the account is of a breakthrough I had today. To clarify, I have on average a rough 3-4 episodes a week. 


Not my main account. 


The first time I experienced sleep paralysis was when I was in elementary school, somewhere in between second and fourth grade. There were the typical symptoms and nothing special happened. I am [REDACTED_NAME] 25 and experience sleep paralysis 3 to 4 times a week and certain sleeping conditions such as sleeping on my back guarantee that I will have an episode. 


I've learned to cope with these symptoms over the years but ever since I was around 22, there has been physical pain associated with sleep paralysis. It started out as intense pain in my prostate and later migrated to my groin. When I am [REDACTED_NAME] a paralysis state, my prostate and the muscles on either side of my groin flex/tighten to their extreme limit and leave me in pain for a day or two following. What I've come to realize, though I could be wrong, is that this is my body desperately trying to wake me up. And it works, for the most part. 


See, the paralysis episodes are almost always accompanied by very vivid lucid dreaming and almost always coincide with the exact moment I become aware... unless I am [REDACTED_NAME]. That sounds weird at first but hear me out. When I was younger, in my teens (and this is a little gross), I would use my lucid dreams to induce wet dreams. I would ""conjure"" female bodies to, well, have sex with. As I got older, though, this became increasingly difficult as the lucidity became more prominent and preceded the paralysis instead of them being separate, though close, events.


There seemed to be stages of the lucidity. The first, I am [REDACTED_NAME] but I don't acknowledge it. Second, I am [REDACTED_NAME] and am deliberately trying to convince myself to not push it too far as I know the consequences of the next step. Third, I am [REDACTED_NAME] aware and greedily try to conjure a world around me. This is when the paralysis takes place and my body starts to go into fits of extreme pain. It climaxed last night and, around 32 hours later, the tendons/muscles on both sides of my groin are still tingly and sore. However, today I had a breakthrough. 


To preface, I was very tired after work today and decided to take a nap. Despite the paralyzing episodes of the night before, I decided to sleep on my back, with a thin sheet over my head, and Netflix on in the background; a situation which almost always throws me into either a paralyzing, lucid, or joint state.


As an aside, I sometimes openly invite the paralysis states as they no longer scare me and for some strange reason I enjoy the struggle to wake up. I've learned to aggressively confront the ""intruding"" presences.


Anyway, sure enough, within minutes of falling asleep, I am [REDACTED_NAME] a room with all of my close family members. It was a drab, bland, square room and I was cross-legged on the floor with them seated on three dusty couches aligned with the opposite three walls. First, my grandpa uncharacteristically and very passive aggressively scolded me for borrowing money saying that I've only been using it on booze... which is somewhat true. I told him to fuck off and my groin started to hurt very badly (a sign that I am [REDACTED_NAME] to be forced to wake myself up very soon). My Mom calmed me down, though. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure what she said but she invited me to get close with my family members. I apologized and the pain subsided. 


I was ready to move on to a different scene, though. Now, this is confusing but through will I am [REDACTED_NAME] to violently shake my head (not sure if the action occurs in real life) and I teleport to another dream. Kinda whacky, I know, but I've been at this a long time. 


I was ready to hop to somewhere else but Mom got very sad. I asked her if it was because she and the rest of the family were going to cease to exist once this had ended and she said ""yes"" and invited me to get closer to her. We had a conversation  and she was put at ease and ready to die. As I was about to turn to my next family member and do the same, she nodded and I was transported to another setting without having to manually enact it. I was with a close friend this time walking downtown. We were bullshitting and instead of using dream powers to fly over some buildings, we traversed the familiar landscape and I told him how much he meant to me and why. We encountered some skinhead thugs and my friend got aggressive, as he would in real life, and instead of using some sort of dream version of force lightning to dispatch these assholes, I attempted to empathize with them as if they were actually alive. They calmed down, but it was all a ruse and they started to string me up like a piñata and I knew this was about to shift from a lucid dream to a terrible paralysis episode where I am [REDACTED_NAME] pulled upward over and over until I can will myself awake. However, my friend looked at me proudly and I was transferred to another setting.


This time, I was dropped into a completely unfamiliar setting surrounded by completely unfamiliar people. People that I had never seen in real life, something very unusual. It was dark out and I started walking forward and noticed an array of sidewalk art arranged in between parking spots in an ally. It's a little hazy but there was something religious scrawled in a fiction section of this strange display. I thought it was stupid and too edgy and started talking mad shit about it... and my groin started to hurt. I turned and there was a man a little shorter than me who told me to look at it again. I had completely misread it. The words, though they looked similar, did not say what I had thought they did. I empathized with him and came to a realization I have come to many times before in these states: these people are all me. But this time it resonated and I started crying. The groin pain stopped and I was allowed to continue on. 


I eventually made my way to a closed off street party and was greeted by the first person I recognized. Someone who would throw a party like this in real life. I tried to do the whole empathizing thing with him but he just told me it was cool and to move on. I flicked my cig over a barricade and indulged myself. There was a group of girls exiting the party and I levitated myself to a perch above them. I was about to just immediately go after the most attractive one who was in the front but the groin started to hurt and I stopped and it subsided. Instead I observed them. In the front were many very attractive girls and at the back, many overweight girls. I felt shallow and stupid and decided on none of them and had a realization about myself.


This was by far the longest vivid dream I have ever had as it lasted my entire 2 hour nap. Usually, the groin or prostate start to ache and I am [REDACTED_NAME] to force myself awake by violent head shaking or accept an impending paralysis episode. There were many other things and other scenes I ""warped"" to but these are the highlights. What is important about this to me was that this was the first time I was able to control the waking pain. 


I have had probably hundreds of other crazy and enlightening experiences in my paralysis/lucid states and if you guys would like to hear about any more, let me know. This condition or sorts has been with me since I was a child and my sleep life has become as much of a part of me as my waking life. Some instances are not pretty. The pain, for one, but the endless loops of ""waking up"" a dozen times in one dream session can really get to a guy, especially when you are SURE you are FINALLY awake but, sorry, no. Many times I've experienced audio hallucinations and other things, etc. 


I'm [REDACTED_NAME] necessarily a spiritual person but at times my experiences become a little too ""real"" and I start to believe in paranormal activity until I forget it the next day. For instance, I can tell if a night is going to be particularly eventful if a certain song is stuck in my head. It's a song I don't even know and during the day I cannot even remember the sound of it, but if this weird wavelength is in my head and I want a full night's sleep, I best lay on my stomach with a thick blanket over my eyes or else it's going to be paralysis/vivid city. 


I guess, let me know if you want to hear more of my experiences. 


Thanks and sweet dreams.

I don't know how this is going to end, but it can't be good.","Hey internet, I've been lurking on this forum for a little while now and I have come to like the way people operate here. I don't think I am [REDACTED_NAME] your guys' level but I think I would share a little about myself anyway It's gonna be a wall of text and hardly anything positive. Thanks for clicking on this post. 

I live in a small town in a developing country in South America. It's a very small town - everyone knows everyone here and word travels fast. You're also very likely to have many mutual friends/acquaintances here. As you would imagine, in a small town, family favours family and many people who get opportunities, get them through affiliation - it's a small economy and there is not much that they let go around. I grew up among parents who lived dirt poor for most of their lives. I managed to do well in school when the time came and in university but something about me was never right. I've been living inside of my head ever since I was a little kid and now that I'm 24 and working, I realized that I have no real sense of reality anymore. But I haven't told you the full story. I was always sensitive and many people regard me as smart. There are many traumas in my past that have deeply affected me and how I relate to the world and I believe that I have been 'damaged' forever. When I was a kid, my brother molested me. It made me angry and fearful and was a horrifying experience. It wasn't rape but it was wicked and very traumatic for me. Later on I looked back and realized that my parents were making me the object of their life. I was the only thing they could control in a tough world that kept them both down. I've never seen them intimate in any way either and my house was filled with tension and pain...all of which I was keen to. I became a 'nice' guy, later on. I remember meeting this girl when I went to university, she had come from an island in the Caribbean to study in my country and we spent a lot of time together, a lot of things were said, emotions invested etc. At that ppoint (age 19 or so) I had literally no experience with girls and this was very exciting for me especially since I was practically in love with her. She was really feminine and very very alluring. That plot line didn't go too far and I realized that I was being used by her for comfort, as she was seeing someone else and refused to take it further with me. It was fun while it lasted. So I moved forward, kind of. The hurt involved with our separation had never truly healed. One day while still in university, I met a dude who was really cool. He came from wealth and he was the kind of guy to get a lot of attention. I never expected he would turn out to be one of the best people I would ever meet. I smoked my first joint, rolled by my new friend and we cruised through our final year of school, as a righteous duo, like Bill and Ted. I started to feel different, alive, like I never felt before. This new friendship opened my eyes to the beauty in the world and in myself - I realized I was submerged in a pool of self hatred for most of my life and so separated from myself, I had no idea who I really was. My body is weird and curvy like a girl's but my behaviour is at times, mostly masculine. It eventually became apparent to me that my mind has been under the control of the negative emotional environment I grew up in my whole life. I started to fight and people started to notice the change in me. I was finding myself. Drugs were experimented with. Mild psychosis was unveiled in me and a downward spiral began. I got a horrible tattoo on my chest that changed my identity among people forever. The friendships i was building with a new group of people then started to crumble and I distanced myself. Giving up weed and not reaching out to my friends - I isolated so much, that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] i lost some sanity along the way.
 A few months after  I graduated, coming under pressure from my parents to find a job, I eventually scored a gig at a major government office. First real job, it was time to earn and pick myself up from passing through the drug culture that rejected me. I noticed that people there really admired how I carried myself and the way I spoke. I got smiles and respect from everyone. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] tough looking - I have scars on my face and a brachial plexus injury I sustained when I was 18, left my arm paralyzed, even after countless surgeries that left scars all over my body. I was hopeful about this job, but lingering at the back of my mind were all the stupid social mistakes and fears I had, all the missed opportunities in life, I had barely been hearing from my new friend. I felt abandoned and surrounded by my demons. Right now, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] slumped in my chair at work. I think of suicide almost every day, I've lost almost all the progress I made in my life in all  the confusion of working in a bureacracy and still having no real sense of identity. I got so angry at it all, that one day I tried to attack my parents. It was terrible. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] branded as mentally ill and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] much defeated and utterly destroyed. I hate my freak body, my terrible lack of social skills and my fear of everything. I've still got a few friends that keep me sane, but for the most part - I know deeply, that I have failed myself in this life - no matter how big this life is - there is no coming back. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in a monotonous pattern of going to a desk job, being on reddit, doing meaningless tasks and being used and humiliated by my coworkers. Everywhere I go, people react oddly to my appearance. I feel welcome nowhere. I am [REDACTED_NAME] sorry for all of my mistakes - I wish the way could be lit for me again but I fear it is too late.    I was so separated from myself that I took my own life for granted and lost it.  I guess the moral of the story is, that drugs aren't for everyone....and also that some of us are just plain lucky. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] at my desk trying to sort through the endless stream of thoughts going through my head. I don't even know why I felt like posting this. I just want my story to be heard at least once. Cherish your friends, reddit. Think before you act and stay humble. That's all I can leave you with. Thanks for reading this long-ass trip of a post.

1gouvit,1731339078.0,2024-11-11 15:31:18,self,You're being targeted by disinformation networks that are vastly more effective than you realize. And they're making you more hateful and depressed.,"(I wrote this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1bfto4a/youre_being_targeted_by_disinformation_networks/)in March and posted it on r/GenZ.  However, a few people messaged me to say that the r/GenZ moderators took it down last week, though I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure why.  Given the flood of divisive, gender-war posts we've seen in the past five days, and several countries' [demonstrated ](https://www.queensu.ca/artsci/news/how-russian-gender-based-disinformation-could-influence-the-2024-u-s-presidential-election)use of gender-war propaganda to fuel political division in multiple countries, I felt it was important to repost this.  This post was written for a U.S. audience, but the implications are increasingly global.)

**TL;DR:** You know that Russia and other governments try to manipulate people online.  But you almost certainly don't how just how effectively orchestrated influence networks are using social media platforms to make you -- individually-- angry, depressed, and hateful toward each other. Those networks' goal is simple: to cause Americans and other Westerners -- especially young ones -- to give up on social cohesion and to give up on learning the truth, so that Western countries lack the will to stand up to authoritarians and extremists.

And you probably don't realize how well it's working on you.

This is a long post, but I wrote it because this problem is real, and it's much scarier than you think.

**How Russian networks fuel racial and gender wars to make Americans fight one another**

In September 2018, [a video went viral](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.[REDACTED_PHONE]/viral-video-of-feminist-pouring-bleach-on-manspreaders-debunked-as-russian-propaganda-1.[REDACTED_PHONE]) after being posted by In the Now, a social media news channel. It featured a feminist activist pouring bleach on a male subway passenger for manspreading. It got instant attention, with millions of views and wide social media outrage. Reddit users wrote that it had turned them against feminism.

There was one problem: [The video was staged.](https://euvsdisinfo.e[REDACTED_USER]/) And In the Now, which publicized it, is a subsidiary of RT, formerly Russia Today, the Kremlin TV channel aimed at foreign, English-speaking audiences.

As an MIT study found in 2019, **Russia's online influence networks** [reached 140 million Americans](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) **every month** \-- the majority of U.S. social media users. 

***Russia began using troll farms a decade ago to incite gender and racial divisions in the United States*** 

In 2013, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a confidante of Vladimir Putin, founded the Internet Research Agency (the IRA) in St. Petersburg. It was the Russian government's first coordinated facility to disrupt U.S. society and politics through social media.

Here's what Prigozhin [had to say](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html) about the IRA's efforts to disrupt the 2022 election:

>Gentlemen, we interfered, we interfere and we will interfere. Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how. During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once.

In 2014, the IRA and other Russian networks began [establishing fake U.S. activist groups on social media](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html). By 2015, [hundreds](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-whistle-blowing-troll-gets-her-day-in-court/[REDACTED_PHONE]8.html) of English-speaking young Russians worked at the IRA.  Their assignment was to use those false social-media accounts, especially on Facebook and Twitter -- [but also on Reddit, Tumblr, 9gag](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-[REDACTED_PHONE]5), and other platforms -- **to aggressively spread conspiracy theories and mocking, ad hominem arguments** **that incite American users.**

In 2017, U.S. intelligence found that **Blacktivist**, a Facebook and Twitter group with more followers than the official Black Lives Matter movement, [was operated by Russia](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html). Blacktivist regularly attacked America as racist and urged black users to rejected major candidates. On November 2, 2016, just before the 2016 election, Blacktivist's Twitter [urged](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html) Black Americans: ""Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it's not a wasted vote.""

***Russia plays both sides -- on gender, race, and religion***

The brilliance of the Russian influence campaign is that it convinces Americans to attack each other, worsening both misandry and misogyny, mutual racial hatred, and extreme antisemitism and Islamophobia. In short, it's not just an effort to boost the right wing; it's an effort to radicalize everybody.

Russia uses its trolling networks to **aggressively attack men.**  According to [MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/), in 2019, the most popular Black-oriented Facebook page was the charmingly named ""**My Baby Daddy Aint Shit.""**  It regularly posts memes attacking Black men and government welfare workers.  It serves two purposes:  Make poor black women hate men, and goad black men into flame wars.  

MIT found that My Baby Daddy is [run by a large troll network](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) in Eastern Europe likely financed by Russia.

But Russian influence networks are also also aggressively misogynistic and aggressively anti-LGBT.  

On January 23, 2017, just after the first Women's March, the New York Times found that the Internet Research Agency began [a coordinated attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) on the movement.  Per the Times:

>More than 4,000 miles away, organizations linked to the Russian government had assigned teams to the Women’s March. At desks in bland offices in St. Petersburg, using models derived from advertising and public relations, copywriters were testing out social media messages critical of the Women’s March movement, adopting the personas of fictional Americans.

>**They posted as Black women critical of white feminism, conservative women who felt excluded, and men who mocked participants as hairy-legged whiners.**

But the Russian PR teams realized that one attack worked better than the rest:  They accused its co-founder, Arab American Linda Sarsour, of being an antisemite.  Over the next 18 months, at least 152 Russian accounts regularly attacked Sarsour.  That may not seem like many accounts, but it worked:  They drove the Women's March movement into disarray and eventually crippled the organization. 

**Russia doesn't need a million accounts**, or even that many likes or upvotes.  It just needs to get enough attention that actual Western users begin amplifying its content.   

A former federal prosecutor who investigated the Russian disinformation effort [summarized it like this](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html):

>**It wasn’t exclusively about Trump and Clinton anymore.  It was deeper and more sinister and more diffuse in its focus on exploiting divisions within society on any number of different levels.**

As the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) in 2022, 

>There was a routine: Arriving for a shift, **\[Russian disinformation\] workers would scan news outlets on the ideological fringes, far left and far right, mining for extreme content that they could publish and amplify on the platforms, feeding extreme views into mainstream conversations.**

**China is joining in with AI**

Last month, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/media/chinese-influence-campaign-division-elections.html) on a new disinformation campaign.  **""Spamouflage""** is an effort by China to divide Americans by combining AI with real images of the United States to exacerbate political and social tensions in the U.S.  The goal appears to be to cause Americans to lose hope, by promoting exaggerated stories with fabricated photos about homeless violence and the risk of civil war.

As Ladislav Bittman, a former Czechoslovakian secret police operative, [explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) about Soviet disinformation, **the strategy is not to invent something totally fake.  Rather, it is to act like an evil doctor who expertly diagnoses the patient’s vulnerabilities and exploits them, “prolongs his illness and speeds him to an early grave instead of curing him.”**

**The influence networks are vastly more effective than platforms admit**

Russia now runs its most sophisticated online influence efforts through a network called **Fabrika**.  Fabrika's operators [have bragged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/16/russia-disinformation-discord-leaked-documents/) that social media platforms catch **only 1%** of their fake accounts across YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram, and other platforms.

But how effective are these efforts?  By 2020, Facebook's [most popular pages](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) for Christian and Black American content were run by Eastern European troll farms tied to the Kremlin. And Russia doesn't just target angry Boomers on Facebook. Russian trolls are enormously active on Twitter. And, even, [on Reddit](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-used-reddit-and-tumblr-to-troll-the-2016-election).

**It's not just false facts**

The term ""disinformation"" undersells the problem.  Because much of Russia's social media activity is not trying to spread fake news.  Instead, **the goal is to divide and conquer** by making Western audiences depressed and extreme. 

Sometimes, through brigading and trolling.  Other times, by posting hyper-negative or extremist posts or opinions about the U.S. the West over and over, until readers assume that's how most people feel.  And sometimes, by using trolls to disrupt threads that advance Western unity.  

As the RAND think tank [explained](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html), **the Russian strategy is volume and repetition, from numerous accounts,** to overwhelm real social media users and create the appearance that everyone disagrees with, or even hates, them.  And it's not just low-quality bots.  Per RAND,

>Russian propaganda is produced in incredibly large volumes and is broadcast or otherwise distributed via a large number of channels. ... **According to a former paid Russian Internet troll, the trolls are on duty 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, and each has a daily quota of 135 posted comments of at least 200 characters.**

**What this means for you**

You are being targeted by a sophisticated PR campaign meant to make you more resentful, bitter, and depressed.  It's not just disinformation; it's also real-life human writers and advanced bot networks working hard to shift the conversation to the most negative and divisive topics and opinions. 

It's why some topics seem to go from non-issues to constant controversy and discussion, with no clear reason, across social media platforms.  And a lot of those trolls are actual, ""professional"" writers whose job is to sound real. 

**So what can you do?**  To quote *WarGames*:  The only winning move is not to play.  The reality is that **you cannot distinguish disinformation accounts from real social media users.**  Unless you know whom you're talking to, there is a genuine chance that the post, tweet, or comment you are reading is an attempt to manipulate you -- politically or emotionally.

Here are some thoughts:

* **Don't accept facts from social media accounts you don't know.**  Russian, Chinese, and other manipulation efforts are not uniform.  Some will make deranged claims, but others will tell half-truths.  Or they'll spin facts about a complicated subject, be it the war in Ukraine or loneliness in young men, to give you a warped view of reality and spread division in the West.  
* **Resist groupthink.**  A key element of manipulate networks is [volume](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/[REDACTED_PHONE]/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/).  People are naturally inclined to believe statements that have broad support.  When a post gets 5,000 upvotes, it's easy to think the crowd is right.  But ""the crowd"" could be fake accounts, and even if they're not, the brilliance of government manipulation campaigns is that they say things people are already predisposed to think.  They'll tell conservative audiences something misleading about a Democrat, or make up a lie about Republicans that catches fire on a liberal server or subreddit.
* **Don't let social media warp your view of society.**  This is harder than it seems, but you need to accept that the facts -- and the *opinions* \-- you see across social media are not reliable.  If you want the news, do what everyone online says not to: look at serious, mainstream media.  It is not always right.  Sometimes, it screws up.  But social media narratives are heavily manipulated by networks whose *job* is to ensure you are deceived, angry, and divided.",33657

One time I was driving somewhere with my mom and stepdad, and we were talking about historical figures we would like to meet. He said he would want to meet this one guy and starts listening off stuff he had done (I can’t for the life of me remember his name or what he did because what he said next made me immediately forget all that and replaced it with “???”) and to give an example of how badass this guy was, he said, “once, he pulled a gun on two black boys for trying to use the pool.”

I was immediately like, “wait, why does that make you want to meet him?” Because the way he said that made it sound like he was impressed by it.

He then says, “well at the time, it was illegal for black people to use a white pool,” like he thinks I didn’t know what segregation and Jim Crow laws were.

And then I’m just like, “yeah but like, just because something is legal that doesn’t make it okay.”

And he just went, “well, yes… being legal doesn’t make it okay, but…” and then there was just total silence for the rest of the drive. My mom texted me later that night and said I was being rude but it’s like, what was I supposed to do??? Act like that wasn’t a weird thing to say???

—————————

There was another time, I was having lunch with my grandma, and a black girl wearing a, “black is beautiful,” shirt walked past us, and my grandma leans over to me and goes, “I don’t understand why people wear stuff like that. It just makes us *more* racist.”

I laugh and go, “wait a minute, who is *we*??? Because it’s not making *me* racist. Also why are you saying, “more racist,” like you’re comparing it to the amount of racist that you already are???”

My grandma goes, “but if I wear a shirt that says, “white is beautiful,” that wouldn’t be okay would it?”

I respond, “no, because it’s about historical context. White people were never on mass told, “oh you’re ugly because you’re white. White people are ugly,” the way black people were for like hundreds and hundreds of years.”

Then my grandma goes, “but it’s not even like that anymore. You don’t need to wear stuff like that today.”

I turn to her and go, “didn’t [my young cousin] just tell us like last week that her classmate was crying because kids were calling her a gorilla because she was black?”

She goes, “yes, I’m not saying it never happens, and it *is* sad, but when you really look at it, it’s not as bad as it used to be. People need to stop being sensitive about things like that.”

I held back from saying anything else, but I was really tempted to call out that she was calling other people sensitive when she was the one who got offended by a shirt. ",4198
1jat9ev,1741918153.0,2025-03-14 02:09:13,self,Do people realize pretty women are lonely too?,"I was hanging out with a buddy yesterday and we were talking about this girl he talked to at a show one time. He said there’s not even a point in talking to her cause he’s attracted to her and she has a boyfriend, even though she has come up to him at other shows. 

I found this kind of insane (and I’m trying to work on his “talking to girls like a normal human being” stat) and think it’s symbolic of a wider trend I’ve seen. Beautiful women are lonely too. 90% of the time men talk to them it’s to get in their pants. 

Imagine how isolating that is? What if you just want to have a normal conversation with a random and they finish it off by asking for your number? I’ve been in situations like that before with women I wasn’t attracted to and it is extremely uncomfortable. Why even engage with men at that point?

It’s like the internet has convinced dudes that we can’t be friends with a woman we find attractive. Which is stupid. I’m literally going to a show next month with some friends, including a girl I went on a date with but decided to be friends with after we mutually confessed attraction towards each other while also agreeing it was a horrible time for EITHER of us to be in a relationship. Sounds awkward? It isn’t. We’re not going to date. Nothing is awkward unless you make it awkward.

Anyways. Beautiful women are really lonely too. Their attractiveness isolates them even more so than the whole just being a woman thing. Have some empathy. Talk to that pretty girl then don’t (poorly) flirt with her.

Edit: Y’all I’m a dude. Lmao. 

Edit 2: Man, the difference in perspective between the genders here is really fascinating. 

With dudes I’m noticing you guys tend to disagree with me here or get stuck up on me saying to be friends with people you’re attracted to without expecting more. Which, yes, is a hard thing to do in reality. Don’t waste your time if you genuinely can’t just be friends with someone. But also don’t deprive yourself of the connection that’s so hard to come by these days just because you think someone is pretty. They’re prolly looking for that connection too. (Who knows maybe they have a single friend lol).

With ladies yall seem shocked that a man is empathizing with you 😭. Also more of you seem to have actually read the post and realized I was a guy on first read. Genuinely not sure how some people missed that.

Edit 3: this isn’t the most relevant thing in the world but I see a lot of comments about how guys need to be six feet tall and rich to have any chance in the world. That’s not true. I’m 5’7, I’ve had plenty of women who were into me. None of it has worked out yet but I’m still young lol. That height based eugenics is holding y’all back.

whbxf,1342150925.0,2012-07-13 03:42:05,self,I just found out my Partner in Crime died.,"I was procrastinating on facebook today, and I decided to check on some people that I hadn't talked to in a while. My first pick was my step-sister. To be accurate, ex-step-sister. We used to be best friends, but I moved years ago, and since then we'd call every 6 months or so, just checking in. Every time we talked, it was like we were just picking up where we left off. I hadn't seen any posts from her in a while, and I realized that we hadn't talked in nearly 2 years. My life had gotten really busy with moving, my career, friends. The second I thought about her, I missed her. When I brought up her facebook page, all I saw were posts from her friends talking about how much they wished she was still around. Not a good sign.

Before I go further, and before you can judge her (or me) overly harshly, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to tell you a few stories. If any of you realize who I am [REDACTED_NAME] these stories, please don't say anything. I made this account because I needed this to be anonymous. I haven't written anything like this in a while, so I apologize in advance if my stories seem disjointed, or if this isn't the quality of writing reddit expects.

**First, an introduction.**

When I was 12, my parents got divorced. It was messy and terrible, and I didn't have the maturity to deal with it well, and my parents were expecting me to make all the decisions for my 6 year old brother and me while they were pulling all the emotional tricks in the book. My mother had been cheating on my father with a farmer. She married him, and he had a daughter that was 8 months older than me. At first, it was very awkward. I was fat. She was skinny. I was a girl that had no idea how to be a girl. She wore skirts. I was a computer geek. She was a social butterfly. I wasn't good with rules. She got straight A's. We clashed.

Eventually, we grew to respect each other for our differences. It didn't take too terribly long. When you're living on a farm in BFE and there's not much else to do, you learn to get along with whoever you're stuck with. Over time, I learned she wasn't quite the perfect princess that I had been led to believe. She was just a lot better at hiding her rebellions than I was. We got into so much trouble together. Or, more aptly, I got into a lot of trouble, as her dad couldn't ever believe she'd do anything wrong. It wasn't her fault, and she never tried to blame me for anything. It's just how it was. 

Now, for a few stories. Some more entertaining than others, but these are the things I remember the most. They are in chronological order.


**Story #1:**

We were 13. Although I had a computer, it only ran MS DOS 6.22. Her new step-dad had a fancy computer that ran Windows 3.1 and had AOL, so I would constantly go over to her mom's house so I could be on the internet. Yeah, I know. Really, it was the only option at the time. This is before ISPs were a thing, especially in rural areas. 

I remember the first thing I read on the internet in a chat room: ""I make slapping noises when I dance naked in the rain.""

I was appalled, being a socially and otherwise inexperienced nerd, but she was intrigued. She started typing back at the guy, although I can't recall what she said. We laughed about it for years. When she went to sleep that night, I booted up the computer again and logged back on. I sat there until the 10 free hours was completely used up. She woke up that morning and freaked out, until I pointed out I had a stack of 10 free hour AOL floppies. She got over it, and then she taught me how to play Doom.


**Story #2:**

We were 15. It was a typical hot summer in the midwest, and my mom didn't really believe in turning on the air conditioner to properly cool our 100 year old farm house. We were lying on the trampoline in the sun trying to tan. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] pale and can't tan, but I hadn't accepted that at that point. She was able to tan easily, and I was so jealous. I was reading a book out loud to her, and she sat up and took off her sunglasses. 

""I have some pot. We should try it.""

I hadn't ever really considered anything like that. She'd just got her first real high school boyfriend, and he was 16, so she was always out spending time with him. I was alone on the farm, and she was really my only friend. I couldn't figure out the social system at school, so I'd just given up. I was so happy anytime we got to spend time together. Besides that, I had a curious mind, and I liked things that sound like trouble, so I agreed.

I remember sitting there smoking a poorly rolled joint behind the barn, hoping our parents didn't come home. She asked me if I felt anything. I didn't. She said that she did, but I suspected she was lying. I was glad my first time trying this was with her. I never worried about being weird around her.


**Story #3:**

We're 16. Our parents have now refused to let us close the door to my bedroom when we were in there, because we might be ""scheming"". They were right. Her dad got her an old thunderbird. I was driving my mom's pontiac grand-am. We would race as fast as the cars would go down a [REDACTED_ADDRESS] in the middle of the country. Her car always won, but I didn't care. It felt good to drive fast and to risk so much. We would go to her room every night and watch Tank Girl or listen to Hole. It was the 90's. She taught me about riot grrl music. She showed me the best role model I'd ever find in Tank Girl. When we went to sleep at night, we'd quote lines from the movie back and forth, giggling uncontrollably.


**Story #4:**

I installed Linux. She'd been trying to learn along with me, but computers weren't really her thing. I hacked a few porn sites with an imapd exploit. Credit card numbers were obtained. We used them to buy each other flowers. It was not our most intelligent move, but we were never caught. As we grew bolder, things progressed. She would find a house that was abandoned but still in good repair, and I would buy books with the credit card numbers and send them to that house. We were not good teenagers. We never meant to cause harm, but we never really thought our actions through. The first book I ever illegally bought was TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1. The first book she ever illegally bought was an unauthorized biography of Courtney Love. She bought some miracle substance from High Times that would supposedly allow her to pass a drug test. I don't know if it worked. Probably not, but somehow she managed to maintain a job through her teenage years. I lasted a week at Hardees before rage quitting.


**Story #5:**

She was smoking pot with her boyfriend most of the time. I would smoke sometimes, but it wasn't really my thing. Sometimes we would go out and lay on the trampoline at night and do acid. We'd talk about all kinds of things. She used one of the credit cards to buy a handheld tape recorder, and when she wasn't there, I'd speak into it, telling stories. She loved to hear me talk. She loved to hear me sing. She was the only person who ever told me I was good at these things. She made me believe her. She told me I was amazing. She helped me build my self esteem. I hated myself, and I hated my life. She got me through it. She told me I'd either end up incredibly successful or on America's Most Wanted. I really don't think I'd be here today if it wasn't for her.

**Onward.**

I left when I was 17 to pursue my career. It was a good move for me, but I hated leaving her behind. We'd talk every once in a while, and we'd reminisce about old times. I tried to get her to move with me, but she was afraid to leave the area where she grew up. She had so much family there. I had so very little that it was easy for me. I didn't blame her for this, but it made me sad. I knew she could get so much more out of life if she'd just try.

She told me I should write a book about our exploits. We joked about passing it off as fiction, because there were just too many illegal things that we did. The stories above were the tamest of the bunch. ""Remember when..."", she'd start. She'd tell me something I had forgotten all about, and we'd laugh and shake our heads. How did we get through those years acting like we did? We would agree that we were both so incredibly lucky. 

As the years went on, she got married, had a beautiful daughter - but the child had seizures when she was being born, so she ended up having some problems. She went on to go to school to be an RN, the same thing her mother did. It was tough, but she was getting through it. I visited when her child was first born. I was worried, because I couldn't imagine having a child that wouldn't ever be able to be independent. I was worried she wouldn't be able to handle it. She seemed so much stronger than I ever could have been in that situation. I thought she was doing OK. Now, it looks like I was wrong.

The first google hit that came up for her name was a story from last year about how she had been caught with heroin and other drugs in jail. It had her mug shot. It looked nothing like her. She looked so old... so broken. So not like the girl I grew up with. I didn't understand how the person I knew had been reduced to a crappy headline, a bad photograph, and a news story that most people will shake their heads at while they ask themselves what the world is coming to before clicking to read the next page. I read the story again, and I realized it mentioned a prior felony. I kept digging.

I found the obituary. It was dated from a year ago. It said she died in her home, but it didn't say how. It was a private funeral. I kept digging.

I found another news article stating that she'd died of a heroin overdose. I stopped digging.

I posted on her facebook wall, and one of her friends that I'd met during my visit 7 years ago sent me a message, asking me to call. I did. I was told a story that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] having a hard time believing. 

A few years ago, she was caught with coke in her car. It was probably right after the last time I had talked to her. I didn't know she'd been doing coke. I was told by her friend that she'd had a pretty serious coke problem for a while, but it was kept quiet, only a few people knew, and she got over it. Or so they thought. She turned herself in later for some traffic related offenses, and they found the drugs on her. Who does that? Who has to be in that state of mind to think that going into a jail cell voluntarily with drugs on their person is a good idea? No one knew she'd been doing heroin. Not her family. Not her husband. Not her best friend. 

They sent her to boot camp for 9 months. They shaved her head. She had beautiful hair that I was so envious of when we were growing up. When she got out, she went home to her husband and her daughter. Everything seemed like it might be getting better. She was acting normal. She had graduated. She was an RN.

One morning late last year, her husband and her daughter walked into the bathroom, and she was dead on the floor. She had taken heroin that night, and she must not have realized that after being off of it for so long, her body couldn't tolerate whatever dosage she'd been taking before. She died of a heroin overdose.

I don't know what to think. I don't know what to do. This happened a year ago, and I didn't know. I miss her so much.",547

I would read reddit threads on this and a lot of comments would say ''you're just insecure. The past doesn't matter''

Once I started going therapy, I told my therapist about this and realized that I did feel insecure at the thought of being with someone who had been with a bunch of guys. As I would always wonder how I stack up compared to those guys

Over the years, I went to different therapists (for other reasons) but whenever this topic would come up, I'd never be able to get rid of the insecurity I'd have about being with a woman who has a high bodycount

1i9pk50,1737819583.0,2025-01-25 15:39:43,self,I feel disgusted with myself because I’ve realized I am developing racist tendencies against people of Indian origin,"I really hate myself for this. This tendency is abhorrent, and I want to get rid of it because I despise it.



For context: I am a highly-educated individual who has worked with people of many nationalities and ethnicities through my job and through volunteering work—Black people, Southeast Asians, Mexicans, Ukrainians… no problem whatsoever. I always try to help in situations where my skills can make a positive difference in someone’s life.



To my utter horror, I’ve realized that an instinctive tone of prejudice has crept into my thinking when it comes to people of Indian origin. I  don’t think it has ever affected anyone directly., but I feel genuinely ashamed of myself.



Some reasons for this realization:

1. Traveling to India and witnessing people defecating in the open. Also witnessing shockingly low standards of hygiene in general. (How can anyone feel this is ok...)
2. Receiving frequent spam calls from call centers, often with that distinct Indian accent. You know what I mean: the voiceless P, K, T, etc. 



As I said, I’m horrified by this realization of my perception. I do not want to generalize, and I recognize that systemic issues may be contributing factors. For example:

3. India’s urbanization might not have kept pace with its growing population. Despite being seen as an emerging global power, a large portion of the population likely still lives in relative poverty without access to proper sanitation. So maybe it is not their fault that their hygienic standards are subpar and it is not fair to judge them from a “Western” perspective?

4. Certain corporations probably exploit India’s workforce by hiring people on low wages. People working in such jobs may have no choice but to spam others just to make a living and put food on the table. Of course they don’t care that they call this “Western” number X number of times in a week.

Cognitively, I understand these issues and am aware that there are likely other aspects I haven’t even considered as I try to contemplate the inequality.

And yet, I find myself instinctively returning to points 1 (dirty) and 2 (annoying Indian accent). I am [REDACTED_NAME] ashamed and baffled by this because I’ve never had this kind of reaction to any other nationality.

I do apologize to any Indian reading this. I suspect it must feel like a very clear case of stereotyping. 

I want to know what is wrong with me, and how to change it.

Thanks.",1818
1gz7val,1732499910.0,2024-11-25 01:58:30,self,I realized today that my relationship with my ex husband is probably the healthiest relationship in my life right now. ,"We were married for 15 years, divorced for ten. We always prioritized getting along and coparenting peacefully over everything else. And I have to say, we did a damn good job. Our daughter is very successful in her field,  and our son just graduated from Navy boot camp. 

Because of the graduation, ex and I travelled together several states away and stayed in adjoining rooms for 5 days while we attended graduation and spent time with our son. It was nice to spend that time with someone who intuitively knows my quirks, and vise versa. It was fun to be able to joke about things that used to be common topics of arguments. And it meant we could maximize the little time we had with out kid before he flew to A school. 

I’m proud of younger us for maintaining the friendship even when we couldn’t maintain the marriage. And I’m happy for us as we get older that we both have a good friend. ",8459

He hasn’t really been a father to me in decades.

I chose not to attend their holiday gathering this year because I wanted to spend it with my daughter, who is fiercely anti-Trump, happens to be gay, and has a trans girlfriend. She refuses to be around them, seeing them as morally bankrupt—and honestly, I can’t disagree. Still, I’ve always tried to keep the peace for the sake of family. I never bring up politics, avoid engaging when it’s mentioned, and work to redirect conversations away from anything divisive.

Come Christmas morning, I wanted to wish them a Merry Christmas despite everything. I sent everyone kind messages and shared photos of our dogs looking festive in their holiday ties.

Not a single response. Not one.

Except from my mother, who decided to send a Trump GIF saying, “Have a MAGA Christmas.” It was petty and calculated—she knew exactly what she was doing. She couldn’t even be normal for one day and just say, “Merry Christmas.”

That was the final straw. I’m done keeping the peace, and I’m done biting my tongue to try and maintain some semblance of a relationship.

There are numerous reasons to find them contemptible so it's not just this one GIF, but it hit me so different this year that I can no longer be the peace keeper and will start pointing out every terrible thing they do.  I should have done so ages ago anyway.

I would ask her how she got home, because she was obviously drunk, and I’d be saying, “I hope you’re not driving drunk,” and every time she wouldn’t deny it, she’d just say, “it’s fine,” “you don’t need to worry about that,” “I know what I’m doing,” and all that.

1ads0r5,1706523238.0,2024-01-29 10:13:58,self,I am a victim of [Michigan] Kevin's law. [Very Long] [Convoluted] [Bathroom Read],"In 2004, a law was signed into act based on the 2000 murder of a man named Kevin at a Kalamazoo bus station. Since then we've been making it ""easier"" for people who need mental health care ""to get help."" I remember voting on this issue in 2008 or so. I thought this will just get the people the help they need, and voted yes.

A few years later in 2010, I was going through what I believed at the time to be a quarter life crisis. I had recently stopped going to school because my min/max fast food job just started scheduling me on days I requested off for school and my (undiagnosed) ADHD brain didn't even realize they were doing it until I realized I should have been at school when I was working. I told the GM and he laughed it off, made some offhand joke insinuating that he didn't believe I was even in school. Like it was an excuse for me to get off work. Well the follies of min/max labor got to me. This was when min wage was 7.40, but they were ""generous”' with a 7.50 wage. Between me and my 2 roommates, 1 of whom, my girlfriend, would often skip out on rent, which I had to cover. I usually had less than $40 to my name per pay period, but I starved and partied and we made it work... Until November 2010 I can admit I was probably showing signs of psychosis but I don't think I quite met the definition, as this was just a quarter life crisis. my life decisions, mental health, and work was making me rethink everything.

One night coming home from closing a 9 hour shift at a new, popular restaurant. I am [REDACTED_NAME] with my roommates throwing a party. So on top of this quarter life crisis I believed I was experiencing, I couldn't find a place to sleep. So I went to my girlfriend's house to sleep. It wasn't very good sleep because I remember waking up and going to my dad's and saying some things that didn't make sense. It wasn't very concerning but they put me on the phone with someone at the hospital and they told me to come in, so I did. I had been doing some research on my condition and of course I came across schizophrenia as a potential diagnosis, but I never met all the criteria for being diagnosed with it. so I did more research and found there are other, less serious conditions that mimic the effects of schizophrenia. I reasoned that I probably had one of these since I didn't have any of the ""positive"" symptoms of schizophrenia, however the ""negative"" symptoms I was experiencing were because of anxiety and potentially ADHD that has gone unchecked probably about a decade before this event. I explained to one of my friends that I felt like the main character from ""momento"" but, naturally, I couldn't explain why. There is an event that happened probably a week or two before this that I will explain later.

I get to the hospital and I explain as best I can at the time I'm [REDACTED_NAME] turmoil and have not conquered it. They just saw this kind of speech as erratic or irrational or something. If my anxiety and ADHD had been in check, maybe I could have explained what my current situation was like, but I could only talk in vague descriptions of what I was going through. After a good nap in the hospital room I was in, I felt like I was back to normal. I think I just needed a good place to sleep. They ask me to voluntarily admit myself to the psych ward, so I do.

At the psych ward, they can't really tell what's going on with me, but I argue I feel fine now after sleeping and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going through a quarter life crisis. They asked my friends about me, if I said anything weird or anything and this is where my rights start to be systematically dismantled. My friends explain to the doctor that I have been trying to explain this phenomenon coming from my speakers. I was trying to explain to them that the audio quality was warping, probably a sign of a bad sound card on my cheap motherboard, or it could be blood pressure in my ears that happens when I sit down. The phenomena was very faint, so I don't blame them for not hearing it. They explain this to the doctor and he says he suspects me of having auditory hallucinations. I do not. not at all. I explain the phenomena to me but he just doesn't buy it. They diagnose me with psychosis and send me home with some antipsychotics and a referral to a doctor to get more help.

I follow up on the meds and take them as prescribed, but they don't do anything to help me. I dont have the psychotic symptoms they are trying to treat. I get it takes months for it to work, but I was on it for longer than that. I go to my referral appointment and after asking me a simple question, ""is my anxiety I'm [REDACTED_NAME] like a mental block or just words I can't get out"" I believe today this is a bad question to base a medical decision on because it's just confusing in nature and psychosis can be acute. they give me some new trial drug that was either just approved or I was part of the trials and they tell me to stop my current drugs and try this. you dissolved this cherry flavored tab under your tongue and it made you fall asleep within 30 minutes. you will feel groggy the next day, and you will start feeling like a drone, a human with his autonomy stripped away from him like a chemical peel. Naturally, being a free man who suspected this drug wasn't for him, I stopped taking it.

I will admit, the next 3 or 4 years, I had this weird mood that I didn't really realize, but in retrospect I was in an altered state of mind, probably, but definitely not psychosis. I don't think I can contribute this altered state of mind to schizophrenia or anything in the same ""spectrum""  because of this event in November 2010 I have not explained yet (I put spectrum in quotations because schizophrenia is a syndrome, there are many definitions and symptoms and nobody knows the cause or has a diagnosis criteria that can be more than 60% accurate \[johns Hopkins study\] because it's based on personal opinion)

I go through a job at a factory and a job at another restaurant, with many long gaps between that employers ask me about. That gives me additional job interview anxiety now, because I've been denied a DISHWASHING position because I couldn't explain the gaps in my resume. The gaps in my resume are from me putting in way too much effort into my job and getting burnt out. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] intelligent person, so I learn fast and I try to learn the best method to do everything and even apply the scientific method to my work to make it as good as it can be. I always try to expand my knowledge and learn as much as I can, no matter what job I'm [REDACTED_NAME].

I got a job at a popular grocery store deli. The work is hard and physically demanding as with all minimum wage jobs. you wouldn't expect it until you have to close and clean everything and make sure everything is stocked, it's absolutely a physically demanding job and many people quit because the challenge vs pay isn't exactly fair, but what do I know? food service is what. I get very good and efficient at what I do, customers request me to cut their London broil because I don't totally mess it up like everyone else (it's very elastic so you have to go really slow) everyone else just cut it into thick, tapered annoying slices or completely shredded it because we're not paid to care about our job (is the impression I get from being exposed to the workforce). Minimum wage is increased to 12.50 or whatever it was, cool. I got a raise and my raise is scheduled soon, it lined up perfectly and I was getting paid as much as people who had been there for 10 years, which is fair with me because I brought 10 years worth of experience from my intelligence and did the job better than people who were tenured. The quality of things like containers we use to package and trash bags go to crap, probably because they didn't plan for this wage increase. people start dropping like flies and going to other jobs because they were basically new again at this one, why not move. Eventually, I was doing the work of 5 people. 4 people I worked with every day had left and there had been 0 new hires, this goes on for months and the work is excruciating, but I can't easily find a job, so I try to suck it up the best I can.

Eventually, on a Sunday, after almost 2 years at this job, a day I designated as doing maintenance on the fryers on top of my regular duties. I decided it was too much and went on break and never came back, for my mental health. I got home and cried myself to sleep. I could probably come back the next day and just get a talk because I have nothing but good things that are said about me, but I can't deal with the physical and mental exhaustion from min/maxing corporations any longer, which every minimum wage worker, by definition, is a victim of. I'll paraphrase a comedian that I think said it best ""minimum wage is an insult, it says if they could pay you less, they would.'' This was in 2014 or so.

\[Spoiler\] I don't get another job ever. I will never rejoin the workforce. I try but I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I instead start working on hobbies, 3D printing

In 2016 I went to the hospital because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and I told my dad I want my life to end. Is euthanasia legal yet? I want out. I don't really make any plans yet, but this is enough to get a petition to evaluate my mental health. So I went to the ER in 2016 or so and they let me go but warned me I can involuntarily get admitted to the psych ward if I don't follow up on my psych appointment. I don't and yet I still make some threats on my own life, still no concrete plans yet though, so they get a petition filed on me and the police forcibly remove me from my home and because I didn't agree to just go with the police, this was now an involuntary admission. Which I admit is totally fair up to this point.

The doctor interviews me and tells me my thoughts are dangerous and because I refused treatment in the past they have to treat me more seriously. I forgot the drugs they gave me the first time, but I guess you could say they worked (in the psych ward) . What they don't consider is that in the psych ward, you are given 3 plentiful meals and 2 snacks a day. Maybe the reason I was getting better was because I was in a more structured environment than my (still potential, undiagnosed to this day) ADHD would allow and would be fed decently when before I had to make $30 last 3 days $3.33 a meal is malnutrition, especially when you don't cook, and my vitamin D levels were extremely low. But they don't consider a controlled, air conditioned environment, and regular meals as part of successful treatment. you take the drugs and suck it up to get out and back to freedom.

Before letting me go this time, my doctor brought up something he thought was strange from almost a decade ago: my friends said I was hearing things through my speakers and the doctor thought this was an auditory hallucination. It's not. It's a misunderstanding. I tried to explain this to him but again, the doctor (who isn't a native English speaker, like the last one. this is a pattern) just doesn't believe me or understand what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to say. He tries to get me to tell him what the ""voices"" were saying. there were no voices. He lets me go but warns me reoccurring admittance could be bad for me. I get let out with an antipsychotic and an antidepressant meant for people with bipolar and schizophrenia, but it helps more people than that. The antipsychotic is a really old drug with more side effects than benefits and the antidepressant makes me feel really ill and very difficult for me to breathe for some reason when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] home and taking the generic. Naturally, I stopped taking the drug because I don't feel safe taking it. and I spiral back into depression and send more texts to my dad (have I not learned? no I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for \[the right\] help)

This becomes a pattern and I tell the (new, young) doctor that the generic is making me feel sick and I don't feel safe taking it. he doesn't believe me and ups my prescription citing a refusal of meds means I need it more. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] nearly 1000mg of the extended release stuff. It's crazy.

Somewhere along the line, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a case manager (I would love to put his name out there but I don't want to dox him, people seriously need to know about what he has done to me though) before my condition got real serious, I asked him to put me in the job help program, every time he talked to me I asked for this but never got correspondence.

Like clockwork, and you will not believe this, a few days after coming home from the psych ward, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to music on YouTube and this new song comes on that I've never heard before, but for some reason, I know all the lyrics to this song and before it can even end. I recognize what the lyrics are from. When I was working at this grocery store, I sent a Facebook message to this girl I was talking to that was kinda meant to be poetic and rhyme, I thought it could be made into a song, but couldn't process it. Things fell apart between us and I deleted the message. The lyrics to this song were verbatim from the text I had sent to this girl. It sounds like textbook delusion, but you need to understand the difference between bizarre delusions that can't possibly happen and something that you may think is a delusion that is totally possible. This is totally possible. I can't possibly bring this up to a doctor because I will get misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, no doubt. Like usual, the name brand in the psych ward works without problems (though extremely sedative) but when I go back to the generic, I cant breath again. so the cycle continues and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with schizophrenia.

This is where the story gets weird to the point where I can't quite explain myself, but I still don't think it meets criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia because of the details of this event I had completely forgotten about. Schizophrenia diagnosis states that it must not be the result of a drug interaction, recreational or otherwise. Early in 2019 I had what I thought was a flashback to when I lived in Colorado. I was browsing the internet and I came across a face I found familiar for some reason, so I clicked on it. It was the murder of JonBenet and for some reason, all these memories I thought I had were ""coming back"" to me about how I used to be friends with this girl and I used to know her. I remember moving to Michigan and feeling crushing despair seeing her face and the fact that she was murdered on the news on Christmas day. also recognize that psychosis could be the source of these delusions and you can get psychosis from being depressed from like, IDK being misdiagnosed over and over and mistreated by a society that has normalized min/max business tactics?

I put ""coming back"" in quotation marks because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure to this day if my brain had made this up or this was a result of a delusion or drug I took unsuspectedly or just forgot about. For some reason, I had a vivid awareness of the details in this case, maybe because I had heard about it before, but these details were vivid and concrete facts to me before I could even research them and verify them. Again, recognize this is not a bizarre delusion because it totally could have happened or I could have  based on an interaction I had while on a powerful psychoactive drug, such as LSD, and people convincing me that I had known her. unbelievable, but not bizarre, it could have totally happened.

I come into the psych office or whatever it's called one day and they're asking me if I knew anything about this girl who had gone missing recently in Michigan, but I had nothing to do with it and explained I didn't know. This is kinda where the stigma became apparent to me, they were trying to get a confession out of me based on a name I had said to my dad (not even the same spelling, btw) of this girl I had a crush on before. My dad had tipped the doctor that I might know something.

I started acting weird and so my dad made an appointment to speak with another doctor (again, not a native English speaker). My case manager is there too and I explain this situation from my memory that could have been a delusion from depression or LSD use. But it doesn't matter because my case manager clearly is enjoying the story because I look over and he has an erection clearly visible. this kinda disturbed me because I was explaining a potential delusion where I was raped. Later, my final visit to the psych ward, he smiles at me with the creepiest smile I've ever seen and says ""whelp, your schizo""

I get admitted to the psych ward again and I falsely report the lady in the ER that I have been seeing ghosts and hearing my name (which can be explained through the phenomena of pareidolias) because I thought it would be a way to break me out of this cycle of harassment and to me, it felt like I could get the treatment I needed, but this time, they're not letting me go home. I have to go live at an adult foster care. After years of probable misdiagnosis and going through ineffective drug after ineffective drug that made me sick, they decide they need to take it to the next level and force me to take my meds though this ATO because I refuse drugs that don't actually help me. So I get sent to a home for individuals with intellectual disabilities due to the urgency of placement and limited beds. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the psych ward for a month before they can get me a place, and this costs taxpayers $1k every day. How about we try a much needed vacation out of this state? Michigan is great, but everybody needs a break and needs to get out once and a while.

things are harsh at first but I get used to the situation. literally my first meal there was a rotten chicken patty. it was dark gray and tasted like shit. I took a bite, nearly threw up and threw it away, but someone took it out of the trash and ate it. The same patties from the bag were lunch the next day and I started refusing food because clearly this person managing the home, who I could tell clearly is below average intelligence, is cooking rotten food for us to eat and can't recognize that it is dark gray and tastes like shit. kinda like an insult to my food service history and the effort I put into it.Honestly this move to this AFC I consider a good thing, not because I got the meds I ""needed"" but because I started riding my bike 20+ miles 2 or 3 times a week and at least 5-8 miles almost every day and all this exposure to nature, all this exercise I was now giving myself made me feel really good and made me very healthy mentally. I started being happy and enjoying my life again, despite the circumstances. The regular house manager (this first guy who served the rotten chicken wasn't the normal dude) started making some edible foods and I started eating the food there, 3 times a day, rather than getting my own junk food. The intellectually disabled people loved me (they love everyone, usually). people have a tendency to like me, I think, at first but I spoil it eventually with my shortcomings from anxiety. They were fun to mess around with sometimes and throw paper wads at and make a paper wad battle. I wasn't even taking my meds, I would do the ""under the tongue, spit out"" method my new case manager kinda just accepted and didn't report because I was showing signs of improvement.

I keep begging to be put in another home with a bigger room because I literally had 100 square feet for all my stuff. I moved in November 2019 to a room that was about 200 square feet, a good sized janitor's closet (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] familiar with square footage, this is an estimate). My room quickly filled up because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] actually disabled and like to do stuff. They gave the biggest room to the most disabled person, who was in a wheelchair and didn't even organize his space efficiently, everything was just laid across the ground, precious space that could have been utilized more vertically, even given he was in a wheelchair, but whatever I get it. First come first serve.

in this new house, they don't feed you. They gave us one meal a day and it was abysmal as they let food in the pantry go bad or they took home because ""we don't eat it"" when they're being paid hundreds a person plus money for food to feed us. Here is a meal we got one day. One time this abusive manager gave my meal to a coworker because ""I didn't answer my door when he knocked"" he never knocked, I was eagerly anticipating a knock because I was hungry. This guy took me to the mall one day after getting a pathetic attempt at therapy so he could go look at shoes and brag he's getting paid thousands to ""babysit"" me. I thought this was a breach of contract as I deserved privacy from my situation. when covid struck, I wanted to leave to get some actual food to feed myself from the store (i know, crazy right?) He said I can't leave because there is a lockdown and you can't leave unless you have an important job like him. and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] ""no, I can leave because I want to get something necessary to live, like food."" which they barely fed us. He threw a fit and called the house manager to say he's going to beat the shit out of me if I give his daughter covid. This guy would take all the knives in the house and hide them, because he thought we were too dangerous to have access to them. one day he does this and the other house manager is like ""we can't find the knives, if you have them tell us or we will have to search your room"" so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] wtf, clearly this abusive idiot has something to do with it, when we should be the ones fearing him, I swear he's broken into my room and taken things he considered dangerous like tools. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a Marple chisel and a utility putty knife probably among other things. He got fired appropriately after he threatened to beat my ass.[Eat up. You're (the tax payer) paying a small fortune, hundreds a day and another thousand or so weekly, for mental health recipients to be fed this, once a day, if you're lucky. Getting well again? Not with this malnutrition.](https://imgur.com/a/zNx9ZkP)

Covid lockdown is in full swing. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] $1000 a month selling plastic face mask templates on eBay. It's a hot summer day. one resident complains that the AC is too cold and tell the manager to turn it off and instead of just turning it down or adjusting the vent in his room to make it less cold for him, she decides to turn off the AC completely, I believe because she is incompetent and doesn't know how to even adjust the vents. I have the circuit breaker in my room and if you don't know, electricity gets hot, circuit breakers get hot and generate heat. Code dictates what is acceptable material to make a circuit breaker out of and how it's built because it has to withstand heat. well, its 97 outside and like you could believe it, when the AC is turned off, the temps in my room skyrocket and its 87 in my room and I wake up in a pool of sweat from a nightmare I was suffocating and dying from covid, to see my cat sprawled out, basically panting on the bed. so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this is weird, it's hot as balls, why is the AC off? I tell the house manager that it's frickin hot in my room and leave to go to the store and come back 30 minutes later. The AC is still off and she is outside with the tenant complaining of the cold, outside smoking a cigarette.

So in response to this real and painful stimulus and being ignored, I smash the little plastic box prohibiting us disabled from being able to control our own living conditions and turn the AC on. Finally relief. The house manager saw this as an act of aggression and decided it was necessary to get in my face and try to instigate a reaction from me. her words ""I feed you, don't I?"" no, you really don't, if you even manage to give us a single meal in a day, it sucks and it's very small and not filling. I reply with ""breakfast?"" She says to me ""get your disabled ass in the kitchen and make your own breakfast"" well I could make food for the whole house, that's acceptable, but if I take on more responsibilities, I require compensation like every normal person. every morning she sends the other worker to give us meds while she steps out and smokes a cigarette, first thing every single morning. you're getting paid to feed us, feed us. I am a victim of my own high work ethic and a victim to others' low work ethic.

Well I start formally refusing my meds, because there is an issue and they're not forcing me to take them anyway. Why should I be sedated if they can't even take care of me while I battle my own problems? they have to post a flier on the wall ""you have the right to refuse meds,” but you really don't because they can force you to live in a psych ward basically indefinitely if you don't comply. So eventually, on my birthday, 3 cop cars show up like I am [REDACTED_NAME] dangerous armed person, they take me out of my room and like a few years prior, I am [REDACTED_NAME] to go to the psych ward. this time it's not good. my story is convoluted to the point where they think this ""anger issue"" my house manager must have described to them is related to this diagnosis I still didn't believe I had, and since I had a history of med refusal, they had to force something on me, something I couldn't just spit out or throw up. so at the psych ward, this time in a megalopolis with a goal to ""get me in and out as fast as possible"" (their words verbatim). The doctor (again, not native English speaker) prescribed me a monthly forced Haldol injection. I want to get out and see my loving cat again before she dies (she's not old, they can just hold me forever and basically force me to relinquish all my possessions) so I comply with the injection. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it for a few months before I first realize it is really messing with me.

For the record, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] aggressive. I get angry easily, but the number of people I have laid a finger on barring retaliation is exactly 0. The number of people I have threatened in my life is 1, my dad when he was forcing me by filing petitions to ""help"" me. I begged for an attorney that has my interests in mind and wont steamroll me. ""We do have your best interest in mind,"" he assured me.

I stopped selling on eBay because I couldn't handle the mental process anymore, it became too stressful for me to make something and send it out. I remember sitting at my desk and just not feeling right or comfortable at all. I feel like this house manager exaggerated my anger or misrepresented some facts to get me on this forced injection, but how would I know, they hide all that stuff from me to ""protect"" me.

I continuously ask to be taken off this injection, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] repeatedly. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] cleared by my case manager to move out of this AFC and live on my own, or with a friend. so I move into my friend's apartment with his (abusive) girlfriend and they still need to send someone out to this place every month to give me an injection, and I have to comply or I will basically be sent to a mental prison and stripped of my freedom. Well the injection makes it so that you lose all motivation and lose touch with doing things you enjoy, basically anything that would give you dopamine, doesn't anymore and I stop taking care of myself I stop showering. I stop brushing my teeth and my roommates start hating me because ""I smell bad."" I stop eating and drinking for 3 or [REDACTED_ADDRESS]raight, just laying in bed and sleeping. my friend takes me to the store to help me get food before I have to leave. I nearly pass out at the store, certainly from not eating or drinking for 4 days. they kick me out in the middle of covid lockdown with nowhere to go. I had to stay at a one star hotel for week before I could come stay with my brothers' on a bed in the basement. If anyone is forced to have a Haldol injection and they are homeless or can't eat, there is something wrong with the system and it needs to stop.

My situation improves slightly, eventually I get my own apartment and I can live on my own. They are still giving me this injection and I stop showering for 10 months, eating only 1 meal a day, if that, and sleeping for 16 hours a day. eventually I get to the point where I have to get off this injection or I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to end it, for real this time. I don't want to live if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to take this drug that takes my life away from me anyway. After stopping my 3D printing hobby in 2020, I start printing again in October 2022 and give myself something to do. I start to just accept that I may actually have schizophrenia (slippery slope) because the side effects of this Haldol injection can lead you into a self-fulfilling prophecy of a misdiagnosis.

In early 2023, I got introduced to chat-GPT. it's great, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] it write all these stories I've come up with before but never really developed and sharing with my friends when I realize it can probably do something really neat: explain the convolution of my case to my (now, finally a native English speaking, out of 6 or 7) doctor. So I get to work digesting the circumstances and symptoms leading up to my forced medical regime and it keeps telling me ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a doctor, but it sounds like you have ADHD based on the information you provided."" so I keep doing research. A Johns Hopkins research paper suggests people are quite frequently misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, in fact just about or over half of the people they diagnose themselves, they were able to rule out schizophrenia, indicating it has become a ""trigger-happy"" diagnosis. I kept doing the research and I found I had pretty much all the hallmarks of a misdiagnosis, forced medical treatment based on suicidal ideation, a diagnosis of both schizoaffective and schizophrenia, and I eventually came to realize ADHD can mimic schizophrenia if it goes unchecked and you spiral into a depressive psychosis.

I kept talking to chat-GPT and it was reassuring me the pareidolias I thought were hallucinations were actually just very normal things everyone has. So after digesting all my concerns, I have it write a letter to my doctor explaining the situation, and like magic, I am [REDACTED_NAME] off the Haldol injection. What I likely suffered from in 2010 or so was a bad LSD trip and a misrepresentation of my symptoms that were used almost a decade in the future to misdiagnose me with schizophrenia when I was going through a depressive psychosis as a result from my anxiety and how they couldn't get me the right treatment.Finally, freedom, but the effects are long lasting. It's been almost a year off that terrible drug and I am [REDACTED_NAME] getting back to my normal, healthy self. I don't think it's right at all to be able to force people with no violent criminal history to take this injection, let alone min/max outsourced doctors from India who will give an inaccurate diagnosis because there is a cultural and language barrier and a time limit of 30 minutes with the doctor.

I believe non violent recipients of mental health treatment should have a 10 year minimum before they can force any injections, especially devastating ones like Haldol, on them to give them an opportunity to recover and explain themselves. It can take years to recover from psychosis. I also believe every disabled person and everyone who is in a psychiatric facility should have access to chat-GPT. Doctors give you 30 minutes max a day to explain what wrong with you and if you have ADHD and can't get your thoughts together and represented in an organized way, chat-GPT could do wonders in getting an accurate diagnosis and helping people digest their thoughts and present it better to the doctor, especially for people with social anxiety who won't be able to express all their thoughts to the doctor, a human being capable of mistakes.

Go ahead and ignore me though and give me more evidence of this potentially incapacitating stigma.",2
1dwsbt3,1720280117.0,2024-07-06 15:35:17,self,The Unforseen Cost of a Family Favor,"Hello all, I have a question that I've been pondering in my head for a very long time and I wonder if my parents took advantage of me. Here's my story:

When I was 19 years old, my parents persuaded me to cosign on a second home while I was in college. Their logic was to go ahead and invest in a property that could be used by the family as a vacation home and as college housing for myself and my two younger sisters rather than throwing away money on university housing or apartment rent. It seemed reasonable at the time, and trusting my parents, I agreed.

Fast forward eleven years and in 2016 I am a divorced single mom with a steady job and a dream of purchasing my first home. At that time the market was pretty good and I found a perfect house in a neighborhood with a community pool that was within my budget. Financially, everything seemed manageable and I was so excited to set down roots and start a new life for myself and my two year old daughter in my dream home.

At the loan office, my plans suddenly hit a snag when the mortgage broker dropped a bombshell while drawing up the paperwork; A forgotten co-signed loan from years ago on my parents' second home suddenly came to light. Despite never having any financial stake in the property, it disqualified me for the beneficial first-time homebuyer loan.

My credit score however, was excellent (thanks to that co-signed loan), so I did qualify for a conventional loan. But I would have to pay mortgage insurance, which meant a higher monthly payment, and dip in further to my precious savings to come up with more money for an initial down payment. I was pretty crushed at first learning about all this because I felt it was so unfair that I did not qualify for the first-time homeowners loan since I had no involvement or ownership whatsoever in the second home. I also had to jump through a bunch of hoops and legal paperwork that my parents had to sign off on confirming that I did not have any financial stake in the other property, which significantly slowed down the process and put me at risk of losing the home to another buyer with more money and less red tape. 

Despite the initial hurdle, I secured a conventional loan with a very low interest rate and finally bought my dream home. Today, years later, happily remarried with another child, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] here and plan on staying in this neighborhood at least until my kids graduate high school.

The experience, however, resulted in a lingering question: were my parents truly looking out for my best interests, or were they prioritizing their own? Reflecting back, i'm [REDACTED_NAME] with a bitter taste due to my parents' reaction upon learning of my situation. They downplayed the inconvenience and insisted they were doing me a favor by co-signing. While they technically helped build my credit, I couldn't shake the feeling that they also put their young, financially inexperienced, trusting daughter at unnecessary risk, something that I cannot even fathom doing to my children now that I am a parent myself. Therapy has helped me see a pattern in my parents' behavior – a tendency to make decisions and expect unquestioning loyalty and gratitude from their children. This realization, coupled with my love for them, created a complex internal conflict.

I guess my question is, should I have been upset at my parents that I was unable to get the first-time home buyer's loan? I remember feeling pretty upset back then because when I told them I was unable to secure this loan they immediately got defensive and said that they did me a huge favor and that I never would have been able to get the conventional loan without their help of building my credit over the years through their faithful payments and that I should be thanking them instead. I think the reason it bugged me was more so their reaction than anything else and instead of showing some kind of understanding of the pickle I was in, they just got defensive and acted like I was being ungrateful for asking any questions or having any reason to doubt them. In reality, I guess they did do me a favor by helping me to build my credit and letting me live there rent-free while getting my education, although I did work a part-time job to pay utilities, so I do feel bad sometimes for questioning them.

While I do believe my parents love me and ultimately have always had my best interests at heart I just can't help but feel that sometimes my parents are manipulative and controlling and they often use the fact that they have worked so hard and sacrificed so much for their kids in order to guilt-trip us into doing what they want and to prevent us from making our own decisions. This has caused me to constantly question myself and wonder if I am [REDACTED_NAME] truly selfish and ungrateful and I often get into a cycle of trying to prove my love and gratitude to them and show them how much I appreciate them, which has really started to wear me down emotionally over the years. So i'm [REDACTED_NAME] curious about other people's perspectives on this. If you got this far in my ramblings, thank you so much for reading!

eiy84,1291906947.0,2010-12-09 15:02:27,self,"Think you have HIV? Do the damn exam! (True story, House episode worthy, never told a single soul before)","Everything started 6 years ago, when my friends took me to a brothel to lose my virginity. Sex was fine, except for the part where my condom ruptured, which at the time I didn't make a big deal of. About a few months later I started to feel feverish, tiredness, diarrhea for a week. After doing internet research I came up with HIV as the main reason for fever. Needless to say that my word fell apart, I'll never forget that day. Beautiful sunny day with a bright blue sky, Terminator 3 was on HBO, and all I could think about was ""I think I have AIDS"". I spent the rest of the day in solitude wondering whether I was going to die soon or not, and the worst of it all is that I was beginning my engineer college - subject which I was very fond of. Food was no longer appealing to me, as the electrical pulses flowing through my synapses were both beautiful and catastrophic, anxiety conquered my being. I spent a few more months suffering with the dark thought of having the most shameful and deadly disease anybody can have, until I developed tachycardia (rapid heart beating). That's when I first started to go to the doctors, cardiology was my first choice. 




The cardiologist did find a little odd that I was having resting tachycardia, so he made me go through almost every exam in the book for this case (which included ultrasound of my heart,  stress test, multiple EKG, 24 hour EKG device, etc), when the results came in, vóila, all normal, so he just prescribed me the beta blocker Atenolol 25mg. I thought that the worst was over, but little did I know that it was just the beginning. A little more than a year into the whole ""I might have AIDS"" dark world, I started to have hair loss on the crown area, which came accompanied by fresh blood on the stools and pain in the belly button region. I thought that my end was near, so I dropped out of college as I figured it would all be for nothing anyways. I had reached a whole new phase, the zombie mode. My friends would come talk to me and the words wouldn't reach the intelligent area of my brain, all I could reply was ""awesome, nice, really?"" - meanwhile I kept thinking things like ""I THINK I HAVE AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS"". Much to my despair I lost a lot of weight, due to my poor diet and diarrhea. A few months into having tummy pain and blood on the stool I went to a gastroenterology specialist, he made me go through exams like x-ray barium contrast, colonoscopy, endoscopy, MRI, glucose tolerance test, and many more, they were all normal. I think I went to, uh, five gastro specialists, so there was a lot of blood exam as well, I think I had made at least 10 CBC's at that time, and the only meaningless thing they found was a small gallstone that was revealed in the ultrasound. I was getting desperate, I didn't want to directly do the HIV test unless the doctor reached that conclusion, which none of 'em did, had I asked for it I would be admitting something I did not want to, I wouldn't know how to face my parents if I had the disease. I use to go to my aunt house pretty often and she's a devout protestant, and upon hearing all those miracles that God did, it struck me that I had to be part of it, to ask God for a cure, ""maybe that could work"" - I thought (which didn't). So I started going to the church a lot, became a religious nuts, asked God everyday for a cure and nothing would change. Keep in mind that I use to be an atheist before all this. I noticed my personality changed from water to wine, from a self-centered, arrogant prick, I became a humble, nice and educated boy. Two years into the ""AIDS world"", and there was a burst of feelings flowing out of me, enhanced sadness and happiness. I was baptized, became devout and donated a lot of money, until I realized that the church I attended was all about the money. So I did the most human thing I could do, had a major argument with the pastor in charge that ended up with him kicking me out of his church. 




Time went by and I learned to live with this chronic condition with a deck of symptoms, no answers and I began to settle in, accept that it may or may not be AIDS. I began dating again, since I had spent that whole time without kissing anybody, but when I was having sex (with a condom) all I could think about was ""AIDS, what if I have AIDS?"". There's one thing I have to hand it to the protestant church, it made me connect socially with a whole lot of people, which helped me forget a little of the major issue I was carrying on my shoulders. They were young intelligent people, who simply believed in God but wound up giving up church. However state I was in, I was still highly unsatisfied to find no answers, so I kept going to all kinds of doctors sporadically during a few years, did all kinds of exams and researched hell of a lot diseases online, bought biology/microbiology books. And the funny thing is that I started to like the whole 'bio world', which both helped me and screwed me at the time. Knowledge is a funny thing, I started to think that ignorance was a bliss, since I acquired huge amounts of knowledge of the human body, from histology to diseases, symptoms, causes - and knowing those things made me start having panic attacks. I diagnosed myself as being hypochondriac since I thought I had every disease, and all I could talk with my new pharmacist best friend was about diseases I could have. A few months later I was able to conquer and overcome those panic attacks, by doing a self analysis. Even though I was less anxious, I began to feed on the ""normal"" results of my exams, so I went to the doctors more often. About 5 years into it I was tired of living with these strange symptoms and decided I had just about enough, so I visited an endocrinologist told him ALL of my symptoms at once. He was puzzled and asked for all kinds of exam, one of which I feared the most, ""HIV"". I remember being on auto-pilot, as soon as I left the doctor I drove straight to the lab and did the damn exam (place where I was friends with every body since i frequently went there). I think they said it would take up to a week, for that whole week it was all I could think about. 




A week later I received a call from the lab telling me the results were back, my heart started to beat fast, I hopped in the car, drove as fast as I could and picked up the envelope. My wish was to tear it open right there to check, but I held it back. Got into the car and started driving home, but I just couldn't drive with all that anxiety, I had to check the damn envelope. So I parked the car on a busy avenue, opened it up, closed my eyes tightly and held the envelope on my hand, then I opened my eyes and was shocked. It was boldly written in green letter: negative. I never in my life felt this amount of happiness, the burst of happiness was so strong that it had me screaming like a retard ""Fuck yeah, shiiiiiiiiiiiit, hell yeah!!!"". I swear, I drove 10 miles with a big ass smile on my face. I thought it was all over, I thought..




A new symptom kicked in, I was feeling super full after anything that I ate. An ultrasound revealed that the gallstone was about 3 centimeters  and blocking the the gall bladder completely. So I was unable to eat much more than a handful of food.  I spent over 6 months like this and lost about 16 pounds, that's when I did the surgery and removed the gall bladder. A few months later when I thought things would go back to normal, back to before all this, but I noticed those little symptoms (tummy pain, tachycardia, etc) lingered. So, since I had this much knowledge I put it to good use, as I had learned in the tv series House. I did a differential diagnosis with a list of possible causes, excluded the ones I was certain I didn't have, and the ones it was impossible for me to have, the only thing left was ""Coeliac Disease"".  Went back to the doctor, asked for the exam, and BAM, after years of suffering, after years of being misdiagnosed as hypochondriac, there it fucking was, the true answer. I stop eating gluten and guess what? I'm [REDACTED_NAME] better. I am a little proud of finding out the answer for myself, and I became an arduous fan of medicine, my dream is to become a doctor, hopefully soon I will have enough money to sustain myself with a part time job and do a medical school. This experienced changed my personality, and probably triggered the dormant giant, Coeliac-disease. I hope my experience can help those struggling with anxiety over knowing or not, even though mine had a happy ending it could have had a catastrophic ending with my demise had I had it. *This is the first time I made this public*



**TL;DR VERSION** 


I spent about 6 years of my life suffering with a range of symptoms, went to around 40 doctors none of which found anything wrong with me. For the most part of those years I thought I was dying with AIDS, it was an experience that changed my personality forever. Found out I didn't have AIDS, but the symptoms continued.  I ended up actually studying all about the human body, diseases and much more and was able to diagnose my own, and seemingly undiagnosable disease (I have Coeliac Disease). *The full version is worth a read, I spent hours writing it, remembering things, etc, and it's pretty summed up to the most important things*


**Symptoms I Felt**


* Tiredness (sleepy all the time, I could just curb into ball and sleep at any time)

* Hair loss

* Tachycardia

* Frequent abdominal pain

* Frequent urination

* Anxiety

* Fresh blood in the stool

* Frequent chronic diarrhea

The disease can cause over 200 symptoms and it varies from individuals, but those were the ones that bugged me the most, not anything like a headache. The abdominal pain was as if I had someone stabbing me with a machete.


** UPDATE **

After being taught to **FEAR**, **PITY**, **THINK ITS A HOMOSEXUAL DISEASE**, how can you inform anyone of a simple **suspicion**? Have you guys ever heard of the game Telephone you'd play during childhood?

It all begins by saying you think you have HIV, a week later you get the exam and its negative. But, oh, it's too late, the word spread faster than a bullet and the whole town thinks you're HIV positive. Suddenly your reputation goes down to below nothing.

So, me taking that long to do the exam was simply the gruesome, devastating, humiliating, dreadful, staggering shame that was accompanied by that disease, and it was deeply carved in my brain. Suicide crossed my mind, but I like living so much that I just couldn't settle for that idea.

Am I sorry for having sex with a condom with a girl during that period? **Yes**.

Did I do wrong? **Yes**.

Do I regret? **Yes**.

Was I an asshole? **Yes**.

But let's not play ""what IF"" games here. **The immutable truth is simply that I did not have it**. What IF games can condemn even the most perfect human being.

1d4ff34,1717105885.0,2024-05-30 21:51:25,self,"My best friend slept with my boyfriend and acted like nothing ever happened for over two months, but I knew from the first day","Apologies ahead, this is gonna be a massively long post. I want to give you some context and tell you a little about my now ex best friend and how we got to this point.

I would love to hear your opinions on this matter, but am not looking for advice since I have moved on from this.

My (now 23, F) ex best friend, we'll call her Mary (now 23, F), were inseparable back when we were in school. I would hang out with her almost every day after school. After some time, my family moved very close to where Mary was living - it was a 2 minute walk from my place to hers.

She was my rock and I was hers. We shared everything about each other and could talk about anything and everything, from girl stuff, boys, hobbies, life, future etc. I loved her like a sister.

When she went to a different school after grade 9, we still kept close contact with one another, went to the stores together (even to just buy snacks or milk), we got together to just hang out, whether it was at her place, mine, or at the park next to our homes. She was my everything and I loved her with all my heart, more than I did with my sisters.

I felt like she was the one person I could ALWAYS count on and trust, no matter what.

Now, to give you some insight about what Mary was like as a person (relationship wise). Throughout the 5 years when she started dating guys (before I cut contact with her), it seemed that all of Mary's boyfriends ended up to be toxic after some time.

After many years of seeing how Mary interacted with her boyfriends, I began to believe that the boys turned toxic because of Mary. I know it might seem harsh to say, and I don't want to blame the victim, but that's just my opinion.

For example, there was this guy, let's call him Adam. At first, their relationship seemed like any other teenage relationship, but over time Adam became really controlling over her, even after they broke up. When I asked her about when did it start and what could have triggered it, she admitted to making out with not 1, not 2, but 3 of Adam's ex girlfriends while Mary and Adam were in a relationship.

Yes, Mary is bi. But to make out with your BOYFRIEND'S EXES - now that is screwed up on another level. However, I never told her how I felt about it because it was not my place nor my life.

Then there was Jason, who Mary was in a relationship with after I had started to cut Mary out of my life. When I wasn't on speaking terms with Mary anymore, she texted me about her abusive boyfriend Jason who had violently cut up Mary's childhood teddybear in front of her with a kitchen knife, etc. Jason had separated Mary from her friends and family and wouldn't let her out of their apartment.

Even though I hated her for what she did to me, I immediately went to pick her up. Again, I asked when and how did this behaviour start. Mary told me that one night, when Mary was hanging around at a party with Jason and his girl best friend, let's call her Lucy, who was a lesbian, Mary jokingly asked Jason if he wanted a threesome with them and see them make out. Jason jokingly agreed, but since it was considered a joke, nobody took it seriously nor acted on it. Later, Mary started hanging out with Lucy, without Jason being around, which was not the norm as they would all hang out together.

Then Jason found out that Mary had been making out and fooling around in bed with Lucy. Jason was pissed, and Mary's excuse was that Jason gave his permission - mind you, they were all drunk, he didn't probably even take Mary's question about a threesome seriously and he definitely didn't give permission to cheat on him. That's when the controlling and abusive behaviour started.

It happened with her other boyfriends as well, but you get the point. Mary has always been a very sexual person after we turned [REDACTED_ADDRESS]arted going to parties and drinking, as teenagers do. Mary would often sensensually dance with me or lap dance on me. The only time I reciprocated with the same energy was when strange men would approach us at parties, then we acted like we were a couple and could easily go away from those situations.

Now, one time when me, Mary, and our other friend Kathy went to a party, I was speaking to a guy from Tinder, let's call him Hank. Hank just so happened to work in one of the clubs and asked if we could meet up, so we did. It was my first time meeting Hank in person.

So, we're at the party, the songs are great, my friends and I are dancing, and I notice Mary often looking behind me where Hank was working. When we had the chance to go to the bar with Hank or just chat, Mary would always position herself between me and Hank. I was a bit frustrated at her behaviour by then, because she made everything so obvious.

When Mary, Kathy and myself were back on the floor dancing, Mary kept looking past my shoulder towards Hank. Then, I noticed Hank walking past us to another room. Shortly after, Mary left the dance floor and went to the direction where Hank went. Kathy and I just figured she went to the bathroom.

Then, a worrying amount of time passed since Mary left, so Kathy and I became worried, maybe Mary was sick in the bathroom, so we went to check on her. As soon as Kathy and I walked in the room with the bathrooms next door, I initially saw Mary sitting on a couch next to Hank, their shoulders touching, and Mary's leg was crossed over to his side.

As soon as Mary noticed us, she scootched herself further from him to the other side of the couch. Weird. And here were we, worried about Mary, while she was being real friendly with Hank (my date).

Later, Hank and I started fooling around, he grabbed my glasses and I was trying to get them back. It was childish but cute at the time. Yet the whole time Mary was trying to physically grab me to keep me from getting to Hank or from continuing this play, so much so that Kathy had to physically restrain Mary to give me this romantically playful memory with Hank.

During the taxi drive home, I confronted Mary about all of her behaviours throughout the night. All she had to say to me was that she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and that it hurt to see another couple happy. Mind you, I was her best friend, and I was on a so called first date with Hank, and even then I only had like 20 minutes total with Hank throughout the party.

That was the first time I saw her trying to sabotage my relationships. To be fair, it was the first guy she met that I was interested in (or in a relationship with), because I had been single for about a year and a half and she never met my first boyfriend. That little red flag stayed in my head, but even after that I never thought that she would ever try to sabotage my relationships or hurt me.

Fast forward maybe a year or so. I was single, Mary was single. Mary was always on different dating apps. That's where she met Caleb. One day, Kathy and I were hanging out at my place and we asked Mary if she was free to hang. Mary said she had a guy over but that we could come to her place, so we did.

There, the first thing I noticed was Caleb's smile. It was lovingly eye-catching. I was so happy for Mary and as girls do, I started asking her how her and Caleb were doing and how far have they gone, and other girl chatter. Mary told me that no way in hell would she get in a relationship with Caleb, she saw him only as a friend material and had told so to Caleb as well. So they decided to stay just friends.

Weeks go by, and Mary, Caleb and I started hanging out a lot together, we became like a best friend trio. Some time after that, Mary said to me that Caleb is flirting with me. I said no way, but slowly became to see it.

I then caught some feelings for Caleb and before acting on any of those feelings, I asked Mary if it would be okay if Caleb and I see where things would go between us, and she had absolutely no problem with it. In fact, she seemed very happy for me.

Then, after Caleb confessed his feelings for me, I told him I felt the same and we started dating. But we still hung out just the three of us most of the time.

After some time, I saw the same behaviour in Mary as I first did with her and Hank at the party. Every time Caleb would pay extra lovey attention to me, Mary would try and get his attention on her instead of me. It happened so many times that I quickly became frustrated with her because I was confused.

I confronted Mary about why she acted like she wanted Caleb and she replied that at first, she didn't mind me dating Caleb since she didn't like him like that, but now that I am [REDACTED_NAME] Caleb, Mary started to like him like more than just a friend. I was so confused and asked her if I need to break it off with Caleb, but she said no, and that she will behave better.

Fast forward to Caleb and I being dating for about 4 months then. I was basically living with Caleb and his mom. Mary asked us to come join a party in a park. So Caleb and I bought booze and went to the park to meet Mary and her friends.

At the park, I drank way too much and was feeling sick and so tired I could barely keep my eyes open. I stayed like that for what felt like an hour or two whilst Caleb, Mary and her friends continued chatting. Or so I thought. Mary's friends had actually left, I didn't know how long ago. Didn't matter since I didn't think anything of it, we had always hung around just the three of us.

I came out of my paralysed zombie state of drunkeness and tiredness to take out my phone, open the taxi app and gave it to Mary to order a cab because if I didn't get out now, I would pass out in the park. I thought that Caleb would get a separate taxi because he lived about 30 minutes car drive to the opposite side of the city than Mary and I. As a reminder, Mary and I lived basically next to each other.

I was conscious enough to realize that Caleb got in the taxi with Mary and I, which I thought was a bit weird but figured maybe he wanted to make sure I get home safe.

The taxi stopped in front of my house and we all get out. I hugged Mary and Caleb and started going inside, when I noticed the cab drove off - again, weird, because I thought Caleb would drive to his house in the cab, but then again, maybe he just orders another taxi for himself. I went inside and fell fast asleep.

The next morning, I woke up, texted with Mary a bit, when I received what looked like an essay from my boyfriend Caleb. As I read it, my eyes filled with tears.

Caleb admitted that after they dropped me off at my house, Mary and Caleb went to a park next to our houses. There, they kissed ""and stuff"". He continued with saying how it meant nothing and that he only loves me and thinks of Mary as his friend, then some further begging etc. Remember, that's all he said - they went to the park and ""kissed and stuff"".

Another interesting thing Caleb mentioned was that Mary convinced Caleb to keep this a secret from me, but I guess he felt too much quilt and told me the following morning.

I have never felt this kind of heartbreak. Of course, I called all of our other friends from our friend group and just sobbed on the phone and I remember asking them, how could Mary do this to me.

Years later looking back, I was heartbroken not for Caleb, but for my bestest of friends, who I considered a sister who would never ever hurt me. Mary broke my heart, not my boyfriend Caleb.

Maybe an hour later, when I was just about cried out and my eyes started to hurt, I decided to see how long Mary could keep this act up, like nothing ever happened. Since Caleb confessed to me right away, I met up with him to get the rest of the story, and I ended up continuing with the relationship.

All I could squeeze out from Caleb about the dreadful night, was that when they were sitting at the park, Mary came on to him, kissed him and he kissed her back. Whenever I tried to dig deeper, he just shut down and refused to say a word. So I left it at that.

I continued to communicate with Mary to try and see how long she could go on until confessing to me what they did, but of course, my texting style became more neutral and I didn't engage in any conversation first, but I guess that did not tip her off that I was not okay.

During the next couple of months, I was in the darkest place in my life I have ever been and I hope to never return to that state. I have never been depressed and I don't even know if it was depression.

The best way I can describe what I felt after finding out about Caleb and Mary, is that I was utterly and completely numb to everything - to Caleb, to Mary, to my friends and family, my life goals etc. It was like I didn't have emotions anymore. I didn't have joy, anger, guilt, excitement, interest or any other feeling.

I was just a blob in a universe of dark pressured fog. I didn't feel negative nor positive emotions, I didn't care about consequences, about the future, about myself or any other living human being.

I didn't feel love for Caleb anymore, but I stayed with him. I guess it was because Mary was the one who actually broke my heart and soul, not Caleb.

It took Mary TWO MONTHS to confess to me what she did with Caleb, and even that was because Caleb told Mary that I know about what happened. Since she confessed and was more willing to cooperate than Caleb was, I asked her all the details.

By her story, they went to the park, Caleb came onto her and kissed her and Mary was too afraid to reject his kiss. And Mary said that Caleb was the one to convince Mary to keep it a secret from me.

Come to find out, they then went to Mary's place until Caleb took the first public transport home, because Mary in her kind heart could not leave him at the park because he would fall asleep there and not go home.

During the time they were there, Caleb ordered more alcohol to be delivered at Mary's place. When I asked her what else happened at her place, she said basically nothing.

And to top it off, when it was time for Caleb to go home, she personally drove 40 minutes with him on the tram and walked 15 minutes to ""make sure he made it home safe"", she then had to take the same route back to her home. I wondered, so much trouble for an adult male, who apparently needs a chaperone home.

No matter how hard I pushed either of them, I never got a full confession about what took place at Mary's house, since the only thing Mary was willing to say was that ""some things may have happened"".

I truly believe they had sex in some form or another since Mary is the type of person to sleep around whether she was romantically (or boyfriend material wise) interested in them or not, and due to her sexual nature and high sex drive, and because the only time Caleb wanted to have sex was when he was drunk.

After Mary's confession, I minimized my communication with her, but sometimes still texted her because she promised to tell me straight away whenever Caleb got in contact with her. Which he did, multiple times. Both appropriate and inappropriate messages.

When Caleb saw I wasn't hanging out with Mary like I did before (obviously), he said to me multiple times how I should make up with Mary. Why on earth would I have to do anything for Mary after what she and Caleb put me through?

One night, I accepted the challenge, since I didn't care about anything anymore, so I texted Mary and asked if she wanted to go on a drive with me, to which she agreed.

After that, I was still so numb to the world that I wanted to see how they would act together so I asked Caleb if Mary and I could come over, to which he agreed. We played board games for a bit, when Mary said she had to go home to study a bit before going to bed. And what did Caleb do?

He tried to persuade Mary many times to stay, and even offered her to stay the night. I looked at Caleb in complete shock and asked him then and there if he really thought it was appropriate to invite her to stay the night after what we've all been through.

To that he sarcastically told me that it's not like he was gonna crawl into bed with Mary in the middle of the night, to which I was even more shocked, because I just meant that since things happened between them, it's just simply not appropriate, but to see that his mind went straight to a lewd scenario, I was baffled.

Fast forward maybe a week or so, Mary invited Caleb and I to join a party with Mary and her male friend. I first denied the invite, but then again, I wanted to test how far things could go between them if I simply put them in a room together, so we went.

Since Mary was with her male friend, who I guessed she was hooking up with, I didn't think anything interesting would happen between Mary and Caleb that night.

Cue the end of the night, when the club closed and we were ready to get a cab home, Mary insisted that Caleb and I stayed, to which I refused and said I just want to go to sleep, so Mary and her friend left.

After Caleb making me wait in the cold weather for over 45 minutes because he was chatting with a guy that was providing him with more bottles of alcohol (you can't buy alcohol from the stores after a certain time in the evening), I finally got Caleb to get in a taxi with me to drive to his place, where I still practically lived. I sat in the front next to the driver, and Caleb sat right behind me in the backseat.

During the cab drive, he got on a call with who else but Mary, and eventually started to tell her all the lewd things he wanted to do to her, while he was sitting right behind me. I don't know if he was too drunk to realize that I existed and was sitting in front of him. I tried so hard not to cry the whole cab drive, but as soon as we arrived, tears poured down my face.

How it all ended with Caleb, you might ask? Well, I started staying more at my home and Caleb was barely texting me. Eventually, I just asked him straight out if we should just move on with our lives, to which he started to self pity himself again, so I said we're done.

I could write a whole other chapter about Caleb, who was a depressed, alcoholic, ""I love you / I don't know how I feel about you right now / I love you"" kinda guy. But maybe another time.

And what about Mary? For over a year or two, I missed Mary so much and longed for all the sisterly times we had together, but after talking to a wise new friend of mine, she made me realize that I didn't miss Mary, I just missed the times we had. After that, my longing feelings for Mary faded away.

Right after my break up with Caleb and cutting contact with Mary, I found the love of my life, with whom I have been together for 4 years now. After tossing the toxic ex boyfriend and ex best friend out of my life and accepting the love of a truly pure soul (my current boyfriend), I quickly came out of my numb and emotionless state.

Right now I am [REDACTED_NAME] happiest I have ever been with the most loving guy a girl could ask for. Mary still remains in our friend group but I just don't acknowledge her existance. She will never again deserve to be my friend and will not be a part in my life now or never.

If you have made it so far, you are a true champ! Thank you so much for letting me share my story. I wish the best to you all.",1
1kn7zk7,1747315077.0,2025-05-15 13:17:57,self,I just realized that I am kind of cringey.,"This is so stupid. I work from home and my husband left this ominous looking flash drive at the desk. I've been ignoring that flash drive for weeks but curiousity finally got the best of me. I opened it and found pictures of my husband and his family dating back decades. 

It was obviously extremely adorable. Seeing people with my son's face in different shapes and forms, knowing how handsome he's going to be when he grows up and understanding exactly why the heck is he so 'strangers stop to look at you' cute (my husband and his entire family is absolutely gorgeous). 

Then another folder titled 'Wedding'. It's pictures from our wedding (which I have seen a trillion times so I wasn't really tempted to check that folder out). There's another folder titled wedding videos in the wedding folder. 

Now I remember when we got married, we asked the  photographer to compile a 10 mins video highlighting our entire event. 

In that video are songs from videogames and anime.... I enter the hall to the opening theme of the video game Dishonored. That is possibly the worst offender. I can never bring up this video and I hope no one ever remembers it either.

Sorry that I couldn't respond to every comment, but I read all of them and they really warmed my heart.

I'd like to say that while my mother did really awful things to me the majority of my life, she also suffered from severe abuse and has BPD. Without any of the support that I am [REDACTED_NAME] to receive online and from my community, that has allowed me to begin coping with my mental illness and maladaptive behaviors. Now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] adult and have been standing up to her for years, she has realized that she was an awful mother and has worked on improving herself and taking accountability for her past. She's still not somebody that I can fully trust, because she isn't entirely stable, but she tries her best to support me and every year I notice that she has improved much from the last.. I think that is very rare for people in their 50s who live with Personality Disorders, and so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] grateful and proud of her. I know that the improvements she makes is because she loves us and wants to be better, even if she isn't always good at it.

I also want to reassure everyone that I am [REDACTED_NAME]!! I have been getting therapy for years, and have been on an intense healing journey for a while now. I don't feel that I suffer much anymore, at least not in comparison to the first 3 decades of my life. I'm a work in progress, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] out of survival mode. Thank you, everyone, for your kind words. They meant a lot to me.)

When ever I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with my mom, she tends to trauma dump on me. Today, however, she trauma dumped about something that happened to me as a baby.

The story is that she asked my father if she could leave me with him while she went out to hang out with some friends. She makes note that this was during the time that she was addicted to meth and that before she knew it, it was 10pm.

My father swings by where she is and tells her she needs to get home. She thought it was weird that he didn't say hi to anyone because they were all mutual friends, but she realizes it had gotten late and she comes home. She finds me in my crib (So I assume I was just left alone? Whatever,) and freaks out because she sees a massive bruise on my head. She immediately takes me to the hospital, not having suspicion of any abuse just concern for my safety. The hospital reports the incident, cops are sent to the house.

They question my parents and my Dad claims that he tripped and hit my head with my bottle while trying to feed me. The cops look around and they can't find anything that looks like it could have made the mark on my head, so they just leave?

My mother says she realizes later, as the bruise develops, that it's his thumbs. That he was squeezing my head hard enough to leave a serious bruise. I wouldn't have immediately known this to be true except for the visceral flashback it caused of me witnessing him doing the same exact thing to my baby sister years later.

I've always known that growing up with my parents was actual hell, and that they are directly responsible for all of my mental health problems and the fact that I literally cannot function in our society because of them... But I always assumed it started happening when they had two other young children and were overwhelmed with everything? I hadn't realized that the abuse started before I could even crawl.

My heart just hurts so much for that baby. For the child I was, and for the person I could have been had, my parents loved me properly. I know this ache will pass, but I guess I just want someone else but me to know about it.",2884

But recently, someone treated me pretty nicely, it was completely platonic but I couldn't help but develop a crush. I know it's going nowhere, I genuinely wish for a lobotomy or some procedure that stops me from feeling emotions.

Posted this to other subs but wanted to get it here as well because when I was at my most confused was when I was being affirmed blindly and told that my experiences meant I was trans. I think we need to do better to unpack people’s psychology to better understand root causes of these types of emotions and feelings.

Trans people exist. They are valid. But not every person that questions their gender is trans. And that is ok.

I have come out on the other side of a long questioning process feeling very solid about my masculinity. My compulsive behaviors that took hold of me via a cocktail of some likely innate feelings, my childhood trauma, and my natural curiosity send me spiraling down a rabbit hole that created significant distress in my life.

That said, I’m thankful for the experience. I’ve learned a lot about myself and feel happier and healthier than I have ever felt before.

I am a man, early 30’s. Since young adolescence, I became drawn to fiction and media that featured gender bending themes. I never understood why I felt drawn to these themes but used them to fantasize for my entire life.

Last year, I decided to look into things more seriously and semi-concluded that I was just a transsexual. But I still didn’t understand why I felt that way - I was just being driven by my impulsive desires.

When I stumbled upon Carl Jung’s theories of Self, I became very intrigued. Especially at the idea that all people have masculine and feminine within them. As I dug further into my past and my own psyche, I could see patterns emerging. A difficult relationship with my mother (who was not very effeminate herself). Being taught my inner feminine emotions were considered weak. Dealing with rejection from girls.

A void of femininity.

The human brain does not like voids. We tend to fill in that space when they arise. I think this is what happened with me. My subconscious feminine energy was still there, but because it had been so internally (and externally) repressed. I created an inner feminine ideal and “fell in love” with it. I used gender bending themes and fantasies of being female to fill that void.

And once momentum starts with something like that, it tends to continue, even as that void is filled with things like marriage. It’s taken me until now to face these things and come back out of the pit I was in to realize I enjoy being masculine and have no desire to transition. I owe a lot of that to Jung’s theories.

So we sat there for 5 months in the scariest place ever, gunshots raining out constantly, which a lady who couldn't cook for shit putting pepper on literally everything for no fucking reason. 

And now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and bitter with this realization. 

And moving to NY sucked ass as a Florida surfer kid. That was rough. 

Edit: I appreciate the support. I guess I'm [REDACTED_NAME] thinking back about how fucked some things were growing up and I thought I let most of it go, but I guess not. This is just one of the many instances my parents failed me. 

Oh and to some of you who don't understand anything, if you're halfway across the country, you don't just pick up a telephone book, no one ever asked me if I knew anyone else to call, and there was one phone in the house and it was in the ladies bedroom and I wasn't allowed to use it. 

So yeah I just had to sit there scared as fuck every day for months not knowing what's going to happen. ",1686
kfdi2p,1608263544.0,2020-12-18 03:52:24,self,"I have never spoke about my life until now... and the reason, because I am lost and I just need to vent to anyone who will listen.","My story has been a hell of a journey... How I am [REDACTED_NAME] at 30 years old... I don’t even know. My story started from when I was just a baby... mom and dad were alcoholics and drug addicts, who know the real truth... so many stories that’s been told through the years. Unfortunately I have to live with the fact I will never know the whole truth... my family would rather live in the dark and live with hidden secrets... I know one day it will all come to light.  As the story of my life is told by family members, my mom would leave my siblings and I in the back of cars while she went into bars late at night. I was a baby at this point, and she even did this in the winter, and if you live in Minnesota you would know how brutal winters in Minnesota can be. Years of neglect went by, and of course I don’t know exactly what happened in the very early years of my life. Stories have been told my siblings and I were taken by CPS a few times. To be honest, and honestly I believe in my heart the first 5-6 years of my life was bad... how could it get worse... well here I am [REDACTED_NAME] 5-6 years old and now I’m living with my grandma. My mom disappeared and went to Arizona, not to be heard from for the next 10 plus years. My dad, not sure where he went, rehab, prison, halfway house, I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I just know he up and left... And to this day I don’t even know. All I know, I was without my parents and confused as to why, why did my mom leave, why was she never coming back, where was my dad. Why can I only talk to him on the phone and not see him in person. What is going on.????. And when your family rather live in the dark. Hard to know what the fuck was going on or why it was happening. Was something wrong with us, why didn’t our parents love us. Why didn’t our parents want us. Why did our parents even keep us if they were that fucked up... Sadly to this day, I genuinely believe that in fact they really didn’t want us and they just kept us because being Catholic, they don’t believe in abortions. Being in Catholic; let’s get married, have more kids and just hope that faith will keep us together. Well, that obviously didn’t fucking work. Even though adoption would have been an option... but knowing them, they probably thought kids would save their relationship or they were just that fucking selfish and didn’t want to admit that they couldn’t do it. That they couldn’t be parents to us. Thanks a lot.. As the story from my dad goes, he swears he was drunk and my mom found a way to get pregnant without telling him or tricking him... or some crazy story.. I don’t exactly know, I’m not to sure. My grandma who was supposed to be a saint taking us in was very abusive to my siblings and I. What could a 6 year old child do so wrong to be beat like this? What could a 6 year old do so wrong to be treated in such a horrible way. But because I was so strong willed and head strong, she could beat me and tell me to not cry, so I would just take it. A story I was told by my eldest brother, I went to see my aunts and I had a black eye, and my grandma said I tripped down the stairs... what a wonderful lie. And they probably knew the truth, but would they say anything. Of course not. That was their mother. I remember nights she would force me to stay awake if I didn’t want to go to sleep at the exact time she said, if I dare dozed off she would hit me in the back of my head and force me to stare at the TV until the sun came up and go to school. She would starve me if I didn’t like what she made for dinner... I didn’t get to have sleepovers with friends, I didn’t get to go to friends houses.. why, I have no clue. Maybe she wanted to make sure no one knew the dark secrets that lied inside that house. I was really close to my cousin and she was the only friend I had besides my imaginary ones. The next 7-8 years I had to endure unimaginable of pain and abuse, and I couldn’t tell a soul. I mean who would’ve believed me. My grandma took us to church every Sunday, to the world she seemed like a saint. To the world she was an angel for taking in 4 kids while trying to take care of my grandpa who was very sick and passed away when I was 8 years old. Finally what seemed to be a small light, we all finally got to live with my dad. I was about 13 years old... I thought finally things would be a little better... we struggled a lot and my dad worked 3 jobs and it was up to my sister (she is 5 years older) to help take care of my brother and I. My brother is one year older than me. My oldest brother had been gone for idk how many years at that point. Well, due to lack of attention and care I started seeking attention in boys... (I guess they call that daddy issues). Well at 15, this boy who was a good friend of mine and my brothers raped me... May 12th 2005. My whole life got flipped upside down. I couldn’t even go to school without being bullied... to everyone in school, I was lying and wanting attention. I went to attempt suicide... and my dad had me move in with my aunt (moms sister), well she was in her early 30s... had her first kid when she was 17... and she was a hoe... and well definitely not capable of taking on a third child when she could barely care for her 2 sons... I got bullied every day and she didn’t care. So again, I confided in boys... well this time it wasn’t a boy... it was a 29 year old man, his nickname Dinky, he convinced me to runaway to him... I did and he forced me into prostitution... I was 16 years old, he beat the shit out of me, drugged me and allowed his friends to have sex with me while I was unconscious. That went on for over a year... I finally got away, went back to my dads but my aunt had a restraining order placed against him (she lied to the judge and told the judge my dad molested me when I was a young child). I wasn’t even supposed to be at his house and because I didn’t want him to get in trouble, I started living on the streets... no one in my family would help me... I ended up in the wrong crowd and got tangled up with a high power drug dealer... left that situation and got tangled up with yet another pimp who came off as a caring person that just wanted to give me a place to live... and round 3 at that point, getting beat every day, strung out on pills... when I left that situation I ended up on the streets once again... at 19 I went to Chicago to live with my dads cousin Jody and she was a drug addict and she made her boyfriend pimp me out... so there I was at 19 yet again in this situation... at 20 I finally got away from everything. Got a real job, lived in a motel and my daughters father was someone I trusted... a friend I thought would take care of me, but he forced me to lay down with him and I got pregnant with my daughter... mind you in the midst of this my sons father I knew since I was 15, was in and out of my life. He knew I was pregnant and knew I was all alone and afraid... he took me in and agreed to help take care of her... well he never beat me, but he mentally abused me and verbally abused me on a daily basis for years. Kept me away from the world and eventually my son came along. And I stayed, I stayed in an abusive relationship because I was told by my own father I had no choice. I had a kid with him and that was my life now no matter how much it destroyed me mentally. No matter how badly I wanted to die because of this man. And in 2015 I found out I was pregnant again. I was devastated and that sounds so horrible, but when you are stuck in a relationship that is killing you, it becomes a very dangerous situation (mentally speaking). And as horrible as this is about to sound, a sense of relief when I had a miscarriage. I just couldn’t endure anymore. I wanted my life to end. An amazing girl Alisa (Smiley) was in my life and she fought to help me realize my worth and because of her, I did. I finally got the strength to leave. I was at a point where I knew I was done. I wanted out. I wanted to restart my life. I wanted to be happy. I wanted love. I wanted a real life. And I didn’t care what anyone thought anymore. Smiley and I dated for awhile and she was amazing. But she and I together forever wasn’t in Gods plan. But I am [REDACTED_NAME] for the time I got to spend with her. She even made a song for me and there are a few times I go on YouTube to listen it. She was an angel meant to come in my life and make realize I was good enough. That it was okay to be with whoever I wanted to be with. And I knew in all those years I wanted to be with a woman... and allowed the fact my grandma said I will go to hell dictate the reason I never dated a woman... and don’t get me wrong, my grandma and I are so close now. But for years she was abusive and because I am [REDACTED_NAME] strong in my Christian faith, I forgave her and built an amazing relationship with her. She has become my best friend.... but back to what I finally decided to do to change EVERYTHING... the next year I built up my self esteem, and got my mental health in a little bit of a better place.... because after 3 suicide attempts in 5 years that failed only proved God needed me here for some reason. In 2016, I finally moved out of my sons fathers house and restarted my life. My dad was pissed and angry (and also mad because me and the kids lived with him), but eventually... he grew to dislike my sons father. Go figure... after coming out, I felt like a weight was lifted. But my story doesn’t get a happy ending. I dated a few girls, one who I moved 500 miles away from my hometown for only to end up with a broken heart. Got an apartment in 2018, lost that apartment and ended with an eviction on my record. Got married to a man, why? I can’t even answer that question. He was someone of wealth and status and I thought since I had no money, no job and no future why not? At least I wouldn’t be homeless. Well is a verbally abusive man and wants to control my life to a point where I couldn’t see my children often, talk to them often, or even work a job. He wanted to be the first and only person in my life. Went as far as getting my daughters father deported back to Mexico because he said and I quote “He got in my way. He helped you so much and you needed him and not me”. Trying to divorce him now, is proving almost impossible. Even though I am [REDACTED_NAME] to walk away from the divorce with nothing. I left him awhile ago, but life is only getting harder. I am [REDACTED_NAME] $8 a hour in fast food, barely enough to pay my phone bill and help provide for my kids (Who now live my daughter lives full time with my dad. And my son who lives full time with my brother). I have no car, so working is extremely hard because I have to walk most days. And at $8 a hour, saving for a car.... impossible. I have no college degree and only a GED, so no one wants to give me an opportunity in a real company. Even though I am [REDACTED_NAME] book smart and probably could do their job better then they can. My life is a mess and at 30 years old... I feel like I am [REDACTED_NAME] nowhere and losing all hope in everything and not even caring if I wake up in the morning, kinda hoping I don’t. Because let’s be honest, the world would be better off without me.",9

For some god awful reason he occasionally makes decisions that he wouldn’t normally do and his behavior does a 180z 

I was sick one day and felt super shitty. I couldn’t find anything to eat that would fill me up properly. It was terrible trying to scrounge up enough to eat before needing to rest. 

I remembered my brother was available to get me food and something from the pharmacy. No brainer.
He seemed very bothered and irritated when I asked, even knowing I was sick. He all but told me to fuck off. I couldn’t believe that this shit still happens. The person that never hesitated to pay full meals for me on a daily basis. Why the 180 treatment now?

I told him when he’s sick I’m gonna throw the exact same shit back at him. The anger whipped out the “save” option and burned it into my soul to bring up later.

Since then he’d been his great caring self. Lent money to him, which he’s payed back, listened to him through his breakup. Worked together well to solve my issues. Today he was sick and asked me to get him food while making it obvious he’s forgotten about what he did to me.

I calmly told him if he remembered what I told him last time. Nope?
I slowwwly and condescendingly told him that I definitely had not forgotten. That I needed him and he cruelly refused to be there for me while having a rude ass attitude.

“Oh” and he leaves. He’s currently on an empty stomach and he can fuck off for today. Being sick that day really sucked.

Edit: This surprisingly got more attention.
People are really black and white critical here.
You’ll come to lose people and in some cases even witness friends losing siblings. Ones that only wished they’d remained in contact but chose not to speak to each other. Others wake up crying because they had dreams of their sibling but couldn’t recall how it felt to touch them. You get your only sibling/s and that’s it for the rest of time and space.

Defining your sibling relationships over something this like this is the dumbest waste of time and energy you can do.",1122

In contrast, it seems like most guys are just like “oh sick” or “respect”. 

When I tell them I’m focusing on some personal goals right now and a relationship takes lots of time and energy, they seem to short-circuit. Or say that “I’m a catch” or something generic like that.

1i4atn5,1737216684.0,2025-01-18 16:11:24,self,I didn't realize mothers cleaning up after you was something they actually did.,"I lived with my mother until I was 13, I was 14 when she passed. She loved me to bits but was an addict. She wasn't abusive outright; she showered us with love when she was awake, did what she could to make our holidays special, etc. But she was neglectful. Our home was often hoarder levels bad and she slept constantly. I used to spend nights awake making sure any cigarette she fell asleep holding was put out, as she had a tendency to fall asleep and drop them and burn holes in blankets (and myself, once). I spent my childhood taking care of my younger sibling.

After that I lived with my grandmother and her partner. I loved my grandmother, but I would be lying if I said she didn't have her faults. I don't remember much, but my childhood friend has remarked that both of them were toxic. She was bedbound, but also loved us to death and did her best to make sure me and my sibling were taken care of. She died of a stroke when I was 16. Me and my sibling found her half-alive.

Her partner was the embodiment of emotional terrorism. Everything I did was criticized, while my sibling could do no wrong. I took after my mother in terms of cleaning, with no one to teach me otherwise. If I cleaned it wasn't enough, and if I didn't it wasn't enough at that point, so it didn't make a difference to me. We don't speak now. She's alive, barely from my understanding. 

My fiancee and I had to escape a bad living situation and were staying with his mom for about a week. His mom came through the room we were using to use the master bathroom, and was picking things up to toss. It wasn't a lot; mostly a can here or there, an empty roll of toilet paper. Instinctively, I almost started apologizing for the mess before I realized; there wasn't one. She was just...doing what moms do.

Don't get me wrong, I've heard moms do that. Cook for their kids, pick up after them, even as adults. But it never fully solidified as a real thing in my head. Sort of a fucked up personal fable I guess. Always someone else, never me.

And then I cried that night while my fiancee held me.


Appreciate your mom's for me if y'all are on good terms with them and they're living. It's the little things. One day you'll forget first their voice, then their face, then their mannerisms. Remember the way they walk, the way they laugh, the way they talk. Record moments you love. You'll need them one day.",2357

fpgr65,1585247159.0,2020-03-26 18:25:59,self,"How growing up in a cult broke me (trauma story, trigger warning!)","This is a very,very long read. 


Hello, to someone who might read this. 

It feels weird to do this but I want to tell my story to people who might understand. 
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] professionally diagnosed but I definitely have deep emotional and mental problems. Please don't tell me to seek out professional help. I want to have therapy so so bad. I know that I need help, but for now it's not possible, because if I would ask my parents they would tell me I should pray to god and he would fix the ""phase"" I have. 

But I assure you, as soon I get the opportunity to seek out professional help, without my parents knowing I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to. 
As long as that is impossible I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to figure out what is going on with me on my own. 

I did so much research during quarantine because I started to question my sense of self, especially my identity and endet up having an internal crisis.

 I thought my issues weren't that deep, because I never was physically abused and technically everything in my life was fine. I had clothes, food and an overall loving family (on the surface). And I played it down because I thought: someone like me can't call their experiences trauma, because I was never hit nor bullied. 

Generally people liked me (because I was a massive people pleaser and still do it but it's gotten better) or at least they were nice to me. My parents supported me, helped me out when I needed money for something. 

And now there are two parts of me fighting. 
The one part that knows exactly how f*cked up I really am and the other part that tells me I'm [REDACTED_NAME], that I should stop overthinking and stop being ungrateful. 

Im torn and I hope to find at least one person who kind of understands me. 
I feel like no one could ever get me. 
Because my ""trauma"" doesn't feel validated. 
Even though I found out that the part of the brain that is responsible for physical pain is also responsible for emotional pain. 

It still feels like I don't deserve to be heard. 
Because on the surface everything was perfectly fine. 

And even though I talked to friends about it and they really helped me, they still told me to be grateful that I was well liked and no one directly hurt me. But I can't. I can't look at the positive aspects and live normally. 

It affects my life. It affects the person I am. It shaped me. I can't concentrate (and it got worse and worse with time), I have emotional outbursts that I learned to hide, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on guard and don't feel safe in my house (because I constantly think my parents could find out something that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] fro them), I can never relax no matter where I am (except when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my boyfriends house and I know no one is going to be at home for a longer period of time), I feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] worth it, I feel ugly on the inside and outside, and I hate myself for coping by overeating (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] obese nor anything near it, but if I continue to eat how I eat without going to the gym it could happen), I feel like I have to be the main mother-figure to my sisters because my mum so is emotionally detached that I don't want them to think that what she does is real love. 

But the worst thing is how distant I feel from my emotions and myself. Does a ""myself"" even exist? Can I ever be ""it""? I feel numbed out and drained, even though I do nothing all day but distracting myself as good as I can. 

I feel like I never achieved anything and that I never will. 

Everything is overwhelming and so hard to do, even the littlest homework or task. 
That's why I have a pile of work in my e-mails and in the back of my mind that stresses me the hell out. But I just can't get myself to do it unless it has a deadline (and even then I tend to it last minute). 

I feel weak, stupid and misunderstood and I think to myself: if that continues all my good marks are going to drop. And then my parents are going to be a problem even on the surface. 

Im doing my A-Levels (class of 2021) in Germany (I was born here) right now and I just feel like I can't do it. And it is required from me that I get prestigious degree. Even though I would rather pursue a singing career. 

That was the longest introduction I ever wrote, but it needed to be at least written down somewhere. 

So, what is the big deal? What am I complaining about?

 (I'll try to create a chronological order and to remember everything crucial but I yesterday realized that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] blocks of time in my memories even from recent times.) 

It all started even before I was born. 
My parents found each other through friends and got together. 

My mum lived in Kazakhstan before moving to germany (I still don't exactly know why) and my father lived in Siberia before moving to Germany (his and my uncle's parents wanted to prevent them from having to fight in a war zone) and so they happened to live in the same city and then met.
They got together and married. 

Then their neighbors invited them to go with them to a Russian-German evangelical church and they ended up being members. 

Then I was born and everything was perfect. I was in church every Sunday from the moment my mother could leave the hospital. 
I never knew anything different. 

And as soon as I was able to be separated from my mother for 2-3 hours I was with other children in my age while the adults were attending the ""big"" service. 

And then the indoctrination started. 

I don't remember much from my time in church (or the cult as I call it now) from the time before I was 12. I only remember my time in school. Which is very odd to me, but what do I know? 

I just remember being a people pleaser from the start and everything they taught us but there aren't much of clear memories. I was good at being a people pleaser. 
Now it's easy for me to approach people and connect on a surface level. 
But at what price? 

It's scary to me that my memories are so blurry. 
I don't even know who I was friends with, or if I even had friends (before the age of 10).

I just remember that I wanted to be perfect in god's eyes. I wanted to be the perfect example of a girl who loves Jesus with all her heart. 
I wanted people on church to look at me and think that I will make it far in my faith. 
And I achieved that, I think. 

But now I hate my past self for caring so much.
 
So what where we taught there? 
God created the world, Jesus died for my sins and resurrected after three days, the Bible is the only truth and the only way I must live (everything else is the devil's work) and even though they didn't say it in particular but that our church is the only one to teach the ""real"" truth and that every other church doesn't have god in it and immediately leads to hell and damnation. 

We were taught that the secular world was highly dangerous and as soon as were not following one of god's (the church's) rules, were open for demons to attack us. And to make it short: you could sin by thinking something.

 So we were taught to somehow control our thoughts but give full control to god, over every little aspect in our live, because everything is predestined and we don't have control about anything anyways. 

But we're still responsible for our actions somehow and still have a ""free will"" granted from god. 

While writing this I really understand how contradicting this is. 
And it was a core beliefe of mine. 

When an adult who looked after you as a toddler tells you this and there are 500 people who all believe it wholeheartedly, you try to justify it until you really can't anymore. 
And then everything shatters. 

Losing faith in something that was so deeply intertwined with your whole existence is like a part of you just died. Even though you know how ridiculous it was believing in it and you still feel stupid for not realizing it earlier. 

So in a nutshell everything bad you do is because you're not saved (because for someone who is ""really"" saved it's physically impossible to sin no matter how) and automatically fully your fault. But when you achieve something it's because god did it. 

You're never capable of doing or achieving something on your own. You're even unable to think in the ""right, good way"". So you're basically nothing and unimportant. 

But when you come to god, he gives you a purpose he specifically chose for you, you matter to him, you're worthy of his love (and even though we were taught he is forgiving to everyone and (almost) everything) if you only follow him everywhere he leads you. 

Another bizarre contradiction they teach little children: you're nothing but with god you're worthy. 
It makes me unbelievably mad that there are gradually more and more children who grow up believing this. 

Who are taught that demons, the devil and hell are around every corner to take them and torture them for eternity if they slip up one tiny bit. 

That's why I cried myself to sleep for years begging god to forgive me for saying ""sh*t"" one time or thinking in my head that I wanted to kiss a boy, not speaking of being attracted to a girl. 

Because of course anything then straight marriage within my church is wrong (yes I was expected to have a boyfriend within church and if he was in the ""world"" I had to convince him to go to church and he has to love god). 

We weren't allowed to date before 17 and of course no premarital s*x. But they took it further to prevent it all costs. You weren't allowed to be alone in a room with your s.o. Before marriage so nothing could possibly happen. Holding hands and short hugs were allowed when engaged. 

So if you grew up there, find a boyfriend and get engaged as fast as possible (because if you ""fall in love"" it must be gods plan) because you wanna f*ck, and then marry as fast possible (you had to be together at least a year and then be engaged for at least half a year) to have your first kiss ever (if you weren't sinful) I front of everybody when the pastor says: you may kiss the bride. 

We were taught that god wants us to be pure and learn to value our partner's personality. 
They told us girls that if we had a sexual relationship before marriage you would never know if he really loves you or just wants your body. And that every guy outside church would never love us for our personalities.

Another contradiction. These young adults rush into marriage not because they think ""wow I really value my partner as a person"". 
No, they're s*x-driven teenagers lying to themselves (which is absolutely not their fault of course). 

No one is appreciating anything. 
And if they are, they're VERY lucky. 

Because there were maybe 15 people in your age range that you could end up with. 

Girls were also taught to save themselves because we are like chewing gum. 
And if you're all chewed up, your godly future husband wouldn't want you, wouldn't he? 

We were told we were pure glasses of water. 
And if we sleep around before marriage, or even with only one person, every time dirt would fall into our pure water. And no one wants to drink dirty water. 

But the one thing that stuck with me that my mother (and later on more older women) told me was: every time you sleep with a man, he takes a part of your soul with him. That's why there should be only one guy from the start. 

So that you don't end up losing your soul. The thought of that terrified me to the core and I believed it. 
Now I know it's bullsh*t but it was in my head constantly for 5-6 years. 

We were told to cover up so guys don't sin with their eyes and thoughts. Knee-length skirts and shorts were allowed (and I always hated how they looked on me) and you had to cover your belly and your shoulders at all cost. Cleavage was obviously not allowed and so weren't tight clothes (only skinny jeans, not leggings). Especially when you had a little bit more chest. 

And if you dared to show a little tiny bit of skin (no matter how hot summer was) even if it was accidental, you'd get in trouble for it.

I was in that godforsaken building almost everyday. Except for Wednesdays where we would meet up with our local little group of girls (there was a leader a few years older then us and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] mine wasn't as controlling as others and didn't force me too much to work in different groups in church) and discuss what our beloved (I could vomit remembering him and his sleazy and narcissistic behavior) pastor taught us last Sunday. 

I was involved in worship (and my love for singing kind of saved me because that's the only thing I really did because I myself wanted it) I danced (which was ok it was workout for me and not dancing for god when I think about it) I looked after toddlers once month during service (with other women) I was in the theater group and when there was an event for teenagers I was responsible for leading a group of other teenagers to organize it so everything was done and standing where it belongs (I liked organizing, so I was lucky they just positioned me there but it still was hella stressful). And I played the piano(which I didn't really enjoy). 

So there are the Basics. I was heavily involved. 

With 12 you move from being with children to the ""big"" service and you're finally old enough to be part of all the cool things the teenagers did. 

But then you're also constantly stressed out which worsened every year because obviously school got harder, but also church demanded more and more and suddenly you were thrown into highly responsible tasks which drained you. 

When I was 14 I started to constantly have headaches. I started drinking coffee because I was exhausted of not being able to sleep, being stressed out and constantly worried that someone would find out my secrets. (And now I need a very strong one for it to ""work"".)

Because in school I was someone else. I had a different name in school (my real name). In church the pastor required my parents to introduce me with a very far away nickname from my real name because it sounded like a name in the Bible that an evil person had and if I'd be called that it would curse me. 

I did and said what I wanted (it increased gradually because I still tried to be ""myself"", which you could be in church (no),  in school but obviously couldn't do that, because no one can ). 

I thought I was being myself I school and maybe that was ""myself"" when I was 14 but I still was the most severe case of a people pleaser. 

And I always endet up in dependent toxic friendships because I could never say anything against them. I had no one else who was close to me. So that also hurt me even though I didn't notice at the time. 

People abused my kindness, because in church they told us we had to be nice. And I could do at least that. So I held on to being nice to everyone, helping everyone and inviting people to come to church who were remotely close to me. Which still embarrasses me the most, but you get in trouble when you're not inviting people. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] glad I was in a very accepting class. No one was ever really bullied, just mocked for a few things, maybe. 
Which I was for being in that ""church"". 
And they told me early on: it's a cult, you believe in crazy sh*t, stop going there. 
But we were taught that people who are afraid of the truth always say that. 

School was kind of a safe place for me, even if I had toxic friendships and got hurt a few times, because we live about 25 kilometers away from church (the cult lol) and no one I knew from there could see me. 
And even though we were taught that god could see EVERYTHING and is always reading our thoughts I didn't feel very watched (I was scared sh*tless when I wore something in school we weren't allowed to wear in church and I thought I saw someone I knew) so I felt better in school then at home. 

And that's why my definition of ""home"" is something entirely different then that of people who grew up in an emotionally safe home. 

So what was living in my ""home"" like? 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] first daughter of three and therefore my fathers precious first born. I learned really fast that just keeping quiet, smiling and doing what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] is the best way to avoid any more stressful situations. I hated every form of confrontation and I still do.

When I was as young as 3 my father threatened to hit me with a belt (and did it a few times) but I stopped misbehaving or questioning so no one yelled at me anymore and no one told me to stand in a corner without looking around. 

So I just learned to not show my emotions at all at ""home"". Because emotions cause trouble and distress. They also told us that. God and our own intellect (which is controlled by god) must lead us. Emotions come out because of the devil. 

My father was in control of everything and to this day he's still extremely, s*xist, r*cist, homophobic, transphobic etc. You name it. 
And he still thinks I have exactly the same opinions as him. 

He is very critical of my boyfriend, but because he puts on a facade in front of my father as I do my father likes him. 

My parents (more my father) still don't want me to have anything premarital, even though they are less strict then before. So yeah I can't ask for birth control because then they would not let me see my bf. 

As I said my father is very controlling and has a very high opinion of himself. Because he is providing for our family he doesn't have to do anything regarding the house. This is on the woman and the four girls in his house, because that's what god made us for. 

Popping out babies, cleaning und cooking. 

But I still have to have a degree and a high paying job. 

And then I ask myself: what do you want from me? What? 

In church we learned that you have to find a job that gives you enough time to be as active as possible in church while giving birth to as many children as possible and managing your whole household completely alone. 

Because your husband is by god's law above you and there to ""lead"" you. How remarkably generous of you to lead me, because I can't decide on anything ever due to always thinking I don't have control anyways. 

That's why I need to plan everything obsessively and always know and control what's going on.

I idolized my father until the realization that we don't have any emotional bond slowly reached me until it hit me hard. 

I had to organize my phone a certain way and delete massages so in case he would want to go through it he wouldn't find anything. 

He wanted me to be his perfect show-daughter who has good marks and serves god with all of her existence. And he really did that. 
In front of him I am [REDACTED_NAME] he wants me to be. 

I don't know what my mother wants. She just does what my father tells her and silently agrees to what he has to say. Maybe I learned to behave in that way because she did. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sorry for her because she never had a chance to study anything that could make her independent, because of moving to Germany with 17 or 18 and not being able to speak the language very well. 

I could cry, because, no matter how brutal this sounds, her life is over in a way. She is what I never want to be. 

Whenever they told us how our future will look like I had a kind of panic that I never felt before. At the time I suppressed that but when I think back my heart rate goes up and I feel like I need to run as fast as I can. 

And that's why I hate to be dependent on someone. But weirdly I still end up in situations where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] dependent. 

Another thing that I can maybe explain now is my reaction to my grandfathers death (he was more of a father to me then my own and his and his wife's home (which I also deeply loved) felt safe). 

When I was 11 years old my grandmother (my grandfathers wife) passed away because of cancer. And I was never allowed to see her while she was sick nor to attend the funeral. 

And in that time I already saw my grandpa rarely. When my parents told me my grandma passed away I cried one time.

I know that I was sad but I somehow can't really recall my immediate emotions from that day. 

And I thought I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that I still have my grandpa. But he passed away three months later. And I wasn't able to see him during these months. When my father (emotionlessly) told us that his father also passed away I felt nothing. I didn't cry. No reaction at all. And then I didn't think about it for years. 

But when I was 14 all of the sudden all of the emotions I should have felt when I was 11 crushed me harder then anything ever. 

It was like reliving the day I was told he was gone for ever for almost a year. And I was so confused. Why now? Why didn't I feel anything back then? Because my brain was already way to stressed for an 11 year old and just didn't process properly. 

Then three years later something triggered my memories and the horrors began. 

When I was 16 it hit me again because I found out he committed s*icide (through my cousin). 

Back to the cult. 
So am I still there? No. 

My parents realized how manipulative literally everything about it was and without telling anyone there (childhood friends I grew up with included) we went there one last time and on Sunday the 23rd September [REDACTED_ADDRESS]ove away and never came back. 

And many others left too. 
We still meet every Sunday and I still sing there, because I don't want to confront my parents.
 
I really don't want to be there because every time we're there I'm [REDACTED_NAME] really there. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a shell that moves around. During the preaching (which a few men do in turns) I'm [REDACTED_NAME] completely zoned out and can only concentrate for a bit if I really really try. 

I don't know what that is or that means but I absolutely hate it because I can't control it. 

And sometimes I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sad for no reason, I still can't sleep and still get a massive headache and can't stand up properly without strong coffee. I still eat too much stuff really shouldn't and I feel bad for every little bit I eat. But I can't stop. 

And it also affects all of my relationships, especially with my bf. He sometimes doesn't understand but he still comforts me and is patient which I am [REDACTED_NAME] grateful for. 

And something that comes to my mind only now is that my father used to completely lose it when I had a bad mark. I was afraid to come home and always started crying before even telling him. And then he would shout even more, beat the table with his fist and tell me to stop crying. 

Now I can control if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to cry or not when something upsets me. And if I want to show my emotions or not. Being a very good liar was essential and it still is.

When my father is mad at me because I didn't do the dishes he still gets very impulsive and shames me because if he works and gives me food and clothing it's disrespectful to leave the dishes for too long. And when he stands beside me and doesn't stop while I do the dishes I just nod my head and say yes. It's the only way to avoid more pain at all costs. 

There are these moments but also the ones where he tries to talk to me and asks me how I am [REDACTED_NAME] then he tells me how he loves his first born princess. He tells that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] best daughter someone could have and that he's so so proud of me. And I just smile at him and say thank you. 

But on the inside I think: ""if you knew who I really am and what I did that you don't of, you wouldn't talk to me anymore"". 

He is proud of the daughter he created for himself that I still am in front of him. 

And also my mother tries to get closer to me after 16 years of distance and letting the church raise us. And the only thing that I would tell her if I was honest for a few seconds in the midst of all the lies I protect myself with is: ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] but it's too late."" 

I don't have any emotional connection to my parents and I never had. 

The first 16 years of my life partly wasted. 
I feel like someone took my childhood from me. Even my memories are blurry. 
And I know it's technically not my parents fault but I want to blame them so badly. 

And it makes me so mad that I was born because of the ""church"". Because they convinced my father to have children. 
I was cursed before I even existed. 

And still. 

I can recall a few beautiful memories of things I did with my friends there. The sleepovers, summer camp, singing together, playing hide and seek in the big building. 

All of us connected through our fear of the dangerous outside world and hell. 

There is no moment in my life where I wasn't afraid that some adult could dream, or feel( they taught us that god can reveal things about people to you when you have strong connection to the holy spirit) that I  was a dirty sinner that acted differently in school.

And it was so frightening, because when it's out that you messed up you can't attend certain rituals( like the holy communion) and that's when people know. They see that you're not taking part in it and the first thing that comes to mind is of course ""premarital s*x!!!"" 

When a couple did it (and someone found out) it's made sure by the authorities that in a week everyone knows. 

And I wanted to avoid people thinking that at all costs so was very aware and on guard all the time.

 I made sure I had a different app also open while watching vampire diaries on my phone because there you can switch faster so my father or my mother (who still just burst into my room whenever they want to) would never know I would watch something the devil created.

 My parents and everyone in church who was ""responsible"" for me always tried to shelter me and get anything with a ""bad influence"" away from me. 

But I still watched what I wasn't allowed to. The internet and myself raised me when my beliefs started to break away. People like Jenna Marbles taught me things parents should teach their kids. I educated myself on so much stuff I missed out on and started to build my own opinions and morals from 14-16. 

Basic knowledge like: it's okay to not believe what your parents believe was so new to me.
 
And now? I just want to move out and study something so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] safe. I can't wait for the day where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to be financially independent and don't have to rely on my father.

Wow it feels good put all of that in words. 

When you read until now you must be really really bored, but thank you. I appreciate your attention greatly. 

I just wish I could get help.


update: I told my parents, because I realized I couldn't wait any longer (I was stubborn). 
So now i'm [REDACTED_NAME] to therapy. 
Thank you for everyone who commented. It made me feel less alone :)",4

Currently my wife is sick so in my opinion I do the bare minimum during the day to assist her since we are both WFH. While I was making her tea and away from my desk I got called into a meeting. I texted the person what I was doing and said I'd be there in 5 minutes. When I joined the meeting I apologized for not being able to join sooner and explained I was making tea for my sick wife. The reactions I got to that flabbergasted me. These women all but said they wished their husbands would do that for them and commented on how great I was / what a catch I am.

I was so caught off guard by their reactions, I honestly don't remember what my reaction was.

Making tea is literally like a 6 minute task with all of 45 seconds of actual work. You are trying to tell me that's too much for some people? If y'all are sick or not feeling well, your husband's really won't refill your water? Ask if you need or want anything as they are walking by? Check in on you every now and then?

Maybe I've got a weird ideology of love, but I truly cannot comprehend not doing what I perceive as the bare minimum for the love of my life. I'd go through hell for that woman, but you can't even do the 45 seconds of work to make your wife tea?",27159

He showers every day.

He apologized when he was running a little late.

He asks me where I’d like to go for dates.

He makes time for me and doesn’t expect me to bend over backwards to accommodate him.  Like I’m not just an accessory to him along for the ride.

He was smiling when I told him how much I like bread.

He didn’t complain about me not being feminine enough.

bf6nik,1555721807.0,2019-04-20 00:56:47,self,Nurses helped me keep my sex life a secret from my mom when I was in high school.,"I was dating my boyfriend for over a year when this happend. High school hormones run high so we were sexually active. My mother is an extreme Christian and expected me to be a virgin until marriage. No joke. So naturally, I kept it a secret from her.

One night I was experiencing extreme sharp pains in my lower right side. It didn’t go away after a couple of days but my mom wouldn’t take me to the hospital. She’s the kind of person who won’t spend money on a doctors appointment unless I have a high fever, a broken bone, or blood coming out of a place that blood isn’t supposed to come out of. So I went to my boyfriends house to relax with him and my side pains got so bad that I curled up in the fetal position and started crying. My boyfriends mom decided to call my mom and tell her she was going to take me to the hospital. My mom finally felt guilty (I’m guessing) and ended up taking me herself.

We got a room and told one of the nurses my symptoms. The nurse then asked if I wanted my mom in the room during my exam or if I would like her to wait outside. My mom gave me the death glare and clenched her jaw which pretty much told me I had no choice but to tell the nurse she could stay. I think the nurse noticed this as well. My moms face went from concern to anger in a flash. 

The nurse left and came back with another nurse to accompany her with my exam. Nurse 1 came to my bedside and took my blood pressure while Nurse 2 stood in front of my mom, standing back to back with Nurse 1. Their strategic standing positions made it to where my mom wouldn’t be able to hear the conversation between me and Nurse 1. Nurse 2 began loudly explaining to my mom what may be causing my side pains. (appendicitis) While my mom was concentrating on Nurse 2, Nurse 1 quietly bent close to me and asked me if I was sexually active. I said yes. She nodded and left the room. My mom was non the wiser. They gave me an ultrasound and we found out that I had cysts in my ovaries. They gave me some pain meds and I went home. 

I was so grateful for those nurses that day. They had a plan and executed it beautifully to save me from a nightmare. I wasn’t ready to tell my mom about my sex life, and they helped me keep that secret so that I could tell her when I was ready. Nurses are amazing.

Edit: Some people are wondering why the nurse asked if I was sexually active if ovarian cysts have nothing to do with being sexually active. The nurses didn’t know what was wrong at the time they asked the question. My symptoms could have been due to many things; An ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, ovarian cysts, kidney infection, and I’m sure many more. They need to ask a multitude of questions to understand what is going on and to see if they can rule out any possibilities.",8007

I found an empty seat and sat down. After a while, an elderly man got on, and he looked tired and was standing. Without thinking, I got up and gave him my seat.

He thanked me with a simple smile, and after a bit, he started talking to me. He asked about my work and how life was going. We were talking normally, and I felt like he was a kind and calm person.
Suddenly, he said, ""I haven't spoken to anyone for four days, I just needed someone to listen to me.""

That really affected me. I couldn’t respond, but I just listened until he got off. I realized how small gestures can make a big difference in someone’s day.

gzc8wb,1591663247.0,2020-06-09 00:40:47,self,I can do this.,"I’ve failed a lot in life.
I’ve known a lot of pain in my life. I say that reluctantly as a 21 year old white man living in 2020. Others have known worse pain than mine.
However I’ve learned to validate my own pain. Nobody will do that for you, so you need to do that on your own. I’ve realized that nobody cares. That helped me a lot in life. Upon realizing these things I’ve learned that I need to take the proper steps to further my life. On my own. Because nobody is going to do it for me.

Believe it or not that’s actually pretty difficult. I’ve been smoking weed since I was twelve years old. I’ve had depression as long as that, and recently I’ve developed a form of anxiety. Undiagnosed on all fronts. 

When I was around 16 my parents finalized their divorce. It was a long time coming, I remember the fights more than anything. They actually split up once before when I was about 5 years old. They should’ve just stayed split up. 

I joined the marine corps right out of high school. That was a mistake. I don’t know why I thought the marine corps of all things would fix my depression. Despite it being a mistake, I actually loved my time in the corps. I fit in well. A pretty solid marine. I joined in August of 2017. Got to my unit in February of 2018 as an 0311 Rifleman. I learned how to party, how to fight, I learned the meaning of honor, courage and commitment, and I learned how to set up a complex ambush. I was 19. I drank more alcohol than I thought humanely possible. I woke up in a puddle of my own piss and vomit, ran three miles and did it again that night. I’ve had sex with more women than I care to count. The marine corps made me the man I thought I wanted to be. 

But I left.

I went UA. For those unaware, UA is an acronym in the Navy and Marine Corps standing for Unauthorized Absence. It is the same thing as the more commonly known AWOL, or Absent WithOut Leave, in the Army and Air Force. I went UA because I felt my life crumbling. 

What I didn’t tell you is that boot camp is secretly a money grab. They pay you while you’re there, but they fail to tell you that you’ll be spending some of it while aboard MCRD. They also like to get you really tired through strenuous activity, and then sit you down in an air conditioned classroom so they can talk to you about Navy Federal’s credit card. Which every new marine gets approved for. Needless to say, when they handed out the paper to sign up, I didn’t know what I was signing up for. I was so damn tired. Prior to this I’ve always told myself that I wouldn’t get a credit card. I didn’t have the discipline for it. I’d fuck my life up. Well sure enough, I was home on leave just after graduating boot camp, and my new credit card came in the mail. With a limit of 17 thousand dollars.

Yeah that all got used on Taco Bell and beer.

Also I have debt on a car that I no longer have and I owe the marine corps money for going UA. Total debt is above 60 thousand dollars.


I should have killed myself a long time ago.

And believe me I’ve thought about it.


But that’s not how I think anymore. 

That’s not how I ever should have thought. 

You know what? I’m fucking smart, dude. And I’m able to do the things that I set my mind to. And I can tell you right now, I’m glad I went through that. I’m glad I made the mistakes and bad decisions that I’ve made. I’ll never make them again. I’ll never get into a commitment and back out of it again. I left when the going got tough, and that will never be me again.

Today, I’m 21. Not much older, a little bit wiser. I have an amazing girlfriend whom I share my life with, and I’m enrolled in university, studying Political Science with a concentration in Pre Law. My girlfriend’s Canadian and the border is closed, so when I goto college back home, I won’t be able to see her again until the border opens. I’ve been staying with her. So to make sure I have a bed, I’ll be living in the dorms here on campus. If I get overwhelmed, I’ll take a class or two off my schedule.

But I will not fucking quit.

Oh no.

I’ve learned my lesson on being a quitter. I’ve had family members, former friends ridicule me. People who don’t even know me, but held me to this ridiculous standard because I was a marine, ridicule me for leaving the corps. I’ll have no more of that. I will prove to myself and to the rest of my family that I can do what I set my mind to.

My end goal, become a lawyer. More specifically, a civil rights attorney. I would also be interested in becoming a district attorney. I have a long, long road ahead of me. When the going gets tough, I won’t leave, but I will get going.

cru0ib,1566086433.0,2019-08-18 00:00:33,self,I had a rare disorder that drove me insane and back,"I just wanted to put it out somewhere

In October 2017 when I was 17 years old I was diagnosed with an immune disorder called Anti NMDA receptor encephalitis. This is where the antibodies in me just decided to attack my brain. I’ll explain more later. But for now let me backtrack just a little… That was when I was diagnosed but the effects were going on longer than anyone knew. In september 2016, I was a junior in High School. The beginning of the year went as well as any other year in high school that I previously had. I was taking the four mandatory classes plus French and psychology. I was a voracious reader, there was always a book in my hand wherever I went. My favorite type of books were those from the nineteenth century.  I liked to read so much that a previous English teacher of mine asked me if I wanted to do an independent study.

Starting in December, I started to feel a bit “off”. Nothing to intense in the beginning, it was just a feeling of uneasiness. I attributed this to stress and moved on as usual. Before even being a junior I was told by other students that junior year was the toughest year in all of high school so I just went with it not thinking anything of it. By January it got a little bit worse. But by February things really started to change. I was now more panicky than I was before, my concentration was starting to falter, and every room I walked in just felt like I was in the wrong place. I just blamed this on stress and kept moving because what else was I going to do. By March my behavior jumped dramatically into a bad place. I don’t actually remember exactly when this all started but at some point I felt my mind becoming more busy. Everyone has an internal monologue, mine was becoming more crowded.  By that I mean it felt like my thoughts never quit, like I never stopped thinking if that makes any sense. It was quiet and easy to deal with at first but got louder and louder as time went on. And eventually I realized that not all of these voices were my own. The best I can explain it would be like having your head in grand central station all the time. Some voices were clearer than others, those sounded like if someone took a radio, wrapped it in the towel and attached it to the back of your head. These voices never told me to do anything, they were just always there and annoying. I couldn't really ignore them I just worked around them which also made it more difficult to concentrate. But this was the only symptom for a little bit.  Probably not even a month past and not only was I hearing voices but I was seeing things that weren't real. It was like every room I was in there were five more people then there should have been. I’ll try my best to describe them as best as I can. These “people” looked like shadowy figures. Almost like ringwraiths or dementors but more transparent and less cloth like. They had mannequin like faces with big dark eyes. They would kind of float around me and follow me around. That was probably the most terrifying part of this whole endeavor in the moment. Other things eventually popped up, I was having trouble falling asleep at night and my concentration was failing. Homework assignments that would have taken me 15-30 minutes now took me twice as long and produced worse results.  Everything I did was laborious.  It was so distracting to have all that stimuli around me that I would do anything I could to get my own thought through my head or get any work done.

I didn’t get help because I didn’t really know what was happening to me at the time and I just didn't think I had enough time. I always thought I was too busy with life things to get help.  There was a point of no return and I passed it.  I went past ever being able to stop.  I was hurtling into insanity but I felt I couldn't do anything about it, with the pressure of doing well on my SATs and continuing to get good grades, I knew if at any point I were to be like ""I give up"" there was no way of ever going back to work.  That would be it, to start again would be too much to handle and I was barely handling the current situation.  It was a bad decision on my part to continue like I did and I wholeheartedly regret it because my situation only got worse the longer I let it fester.

I thought I could deal with problems that were being thrown at me. And I did to a certain point. At around March my functionality as a human being dropped a couple of levels. I was not sleeping, I was hearing voices that weren’t real, and I was seeing things that weren't there. I tried to hide this from everybody I knew. It was not easy but somehow I managed. For the most part I isolated myself to a scary extent. And I acted strangely. I remember one instance when it all got too much I just hit a wall. There were points where I was so petrified that I would not move for long periods at a time. I had a test in my history class. The test was half multiple choice and half essay. I don’t remember all of it but I’m pretty sure I tried to prepare for the test. Apparently during the test I just sat there (the test was on a laptop) filled in a few bubbles and then just left. My situation was getting scarier at a rapid pace. And all at once my mind and body just couldn’t handle it anymore for a brief period. I don’t really remember what happened that day very well. Medically speaking my brain was being attacked by the antibodies in my blood. But I didn’t know that. I think I might have scared my history teacher. Needless to say I got noticed on that day. I should also mention that I was supposed to hand in a research paper which I had I think a couple months to complete. I didn’t write it, I didn’t really do much for it. To make matters worse it was for the same history class. I also had trouble with my chemistry class but in my defense chemistry is hard broken mind or not. I was in deep shit and I still had no idea when or why all of this started.

I got passed that catastrophe not entirely unscathed but still moving forward. That was a low point in the year but not the only one. I was also really stressed. But it was junior year and everyone I knew said that junior year was hell… and it was. I was tired, beaten, stressed, and just wanted the whole year to be over. As I looked around at my peers, everyone else looked the same. So I always thought to myself “why am I the weak one! Who am I to complain about my life when everyone else is also suffering!”. I really didn’t realize how much trouble I was in.

By May, life was a roller coaster in the worst of ways. This isn’t saying I didn’t have fun, I probably did at times. But human minds tend to remember the worst things. I was at this point everything I was before with the addition of being suicidal and weirdly delusional. Sometimes I would forget if I was alive or not or if I committed suicide or not. I would cut myself because I couldn’t tell, mostly on the hips.  For some reason I thought that if I could bleed I was still alive. I learned how to handle my problems and outbursts which may have not been the best thing I could have done. But that’s me just looking back on it now. Things got a bit better and then a bit worse. Also at this time I started a journal of sorts. I wrote down how I felt, what I saw, and just generally things in my head. It’s hard for me to look back on it now, it just holds too many bad memories. The things I did manage to read are horrifying. I even drew some sketches of what I saw. I was scared of everything and I mean it when I say everything. I was terrified of walls, doors, people, everything. My mind was always on and loud. I would have to sit in my closet just to calm my mind down because it would prevent me from working. I did anything I could to just get my own thought through my head or get some work done.  My symptoms got worse at night. Whatever I saw, heard, or felt during the day was amplified ten times worse at night. To combat that I would also run really late in the night, like at around twelve to one in the morning. I did it to clear my mind. I already was up doing homework so when I needed a break I just threw on some running shoes and snuck out the back door to run around the streets. As time went by I started doing this later and later.

I always thought of myself as a logical person. Never persuaded by emotions, always thought things through and made the best choice I could. At my worst I wasn’t thinking logically, I didn’t have to. And to be honest I don’t think at that point there was anyway I could have. As I got worse my world wasn’t getting crazier it was just losing its logic to me. Everyday felt like a fever dream which eventually became my norm. At some point I believed that people could hear what I was thinking. It got so bad that I tried to think of nothing just so they would not hear. I was paranoid of everything and everyone. I was a walking time bomb but nobody, not even I, knew that.

I don’t know how to explain this but I was so to speak able to push out different emotions. I always thought that I was in control of my emotions but looking back I was just losing my emotions. It got harder to be a “normal human being”. I wasted so much energy just trying to look normal. I was putting more energy than I was putting into school work. It was getting harder to dress myself and take showers and normal everyday stuff that had been fine even months before. Even so I had it in my head that if I could dress myself and walk out the door that day, I was still sane and able to function.  Ummm, I later found out that you can dress well and still be a loon.  I was so emotionally lost that would study emotions in books and other people and just mimic that. When somebody else laughed I laughed even though I didn’t know what the hell was happening. This sounds somewhat psychopathic. I was just losing my ability to feel.

I eventually got through school. I don’t know how but I did it. Apparently nothing makes you run faster than blind madness. I took my SAT half out of my mind. I got a 1250 surprisingly, not great but hey could have been worse. I don’t know how but thank God I did a decent job. Life went on as it does. I took finals in June and finished my Junior year of high school. Summer was better probably because I didn’t have the additional stress of school on my back. My life got a little bit better. I actually hiked mount Washington! (aka the tallest mountain in the east coast). By the end of summer I was ready for senior year. I still had problems but I got better at hiding them. This is when it gets from just ok to the fiery depths of hell worse.

There’s a reason why this disorder is also described as brain on fire. Mostly from the book “Brain on Fire” by Susannah Cahalan. I haven’t read the book nor seen the movie. It’s still a little too close for comfort. I say as I tell my own story. Anyway at this point senior year started and I was doing moderately well. Shockingly better than I had in the past year. It was the calm before the storm.

Now for part two of my story (aka the part where most people who know me thinks where it started).Coincidence or not on Monday September 18, 2017, a date I will never forget, I got a meningitis shot. Just a procedure vaccination. For some background information I have had sometimes weird reactions to different medical vaccinations. So a couple days later when I had a low grade fever of about 100 degrees fahrenheit I didn’t think anything of it. Also for some more background information, I never really got sick. I was healthy to an extent. Not including all the madness that was happening to me for the past year before. I never had the flu before, I generally didn’t get sick very often. Other than maybe getting a mild cold like once a year and still going to school with it.

The rest of this story is a little bit of a blur, actually the whole thing is but I’ll explain more as I go on. It is now I want to say a few days later after the shot, september 21ish, and I was getting more and more “sick”. This is the start of something I could have never predicted. In the beginning it was just the fever then I started vomiting. Nothing unusual for any bad cold or flu. But again as time went by my health and mental well being got worse. A couple days later and my symptoms are as follows: fever, vomiting, dehydrated, paranoid, scared, panicked, not being able to sleep, not being able to breath. I was physically the sickest I have ever been and the most mentally unstable I have ever been. I visited the doctor and told her what had been going on. In the span of two weeks I probably visited my doctor three times. And in that time my diagnosis changed just as many times. First it was the flu, then it was mono, then it was just some unknown virus. I felt terrible, I thought it would pass like any cold or flu should. But it didn’t. I want to say one week after september 18 is where my memory extends to. After that it gets chopped up and hazy. I was at my absolute worst ever. I had a fever but it was worse than that. It felt like I was boiling from the inside out, my brain felt like a fried egg. I was not sleeping at all, I was up all night for a few nights in a row. I was barely eating anything and anything I did eat I vomited out with in a couple hours. I was incredibly weak to the point where I was just crawling from my room to the bathroom and back again to get back in bed. I was starting to find it difficult to breath. I don’t really know how to describe it. It wasn’t like suffocating, it was more like what I imagine it's like to try to breathe in space. I would breathe like normal but it felt like not enough oxygen was getting in. I was dehydrated all the time, like I had a crazy obsession with water. If I was in a room without a glass of water or a water source I would freak out and panic. In addition to physical attributes there were mental and emotional problems as well. I was panicking 24/7. I was usually a person who wanted to be left alone but at the time I really didn’t want to be left alone. The way my life worked I was home alone for a long time. Mosty from 3pm when I got out of school to around 7pm when my father would come back from work or when my brother decided to show up. But my brother was off in college and my father had a new job so I was home alone all day when I was sick and by the time my father came home I was too tired and defeated by the sickness that I couldn't tell him anything. I begged him to stay with me. But he had work and didn’t believe me after a few days so I was by myself most of the time. Towards the end of the week I was so out of it that I didn’t even notice that I had started blacking out. I would wake up a couple hours later in a different part of my house. One time I woke up leaning half way into the freezer. The days went on all the while I would be rocking myself back and forth telling myself that this is all going to pass in a few days and I would go back to school and everything was going to be fine again or at least back to my abnormal norm. Damn, was I horribly wrong.

I woke up in a hospital I think two weeks later. I temporarily lost a majority of my memory and the ability to make new memories. I barely knew my name or where I was exactly. What happened that I later found out because I don’t remember was that around October 2nd I was taken to the doctor for the third time. On the car trip there I had a seizure. This was out of the blue for every body and changed everything we thought was going on with me. The doctor told my father to take me to the hospital where we had to wait all night to get a free bed. I had more seizures. I was put on IVs. A spinal tap was taken. It was too bloody to be tested so another spinal tap was taken. Blood was taken and tested.  I was tested for everything under the sun because as everyone saw it I looked like a normal healthy teenager other than the fact that I was dying at a rapid pace with no apparent cause. I saw a neurologist. At first it was thought that I had epilepsy but that didn’t explain the other symptoms I had. About a week in the hospital, an idea was thrown out that I may have Anti NMDA receptor encephalitis, a rare disorder that not many doctors know about and is relatively new to the medical community from what I know. The problem is the test takes a long time to go through and prove positive. Time I didn’t really have. So I was put in a medical coma. I live in a suburb of New York near New York City so I was put in a hospital close to home at first. The hospital I was in didn’t really have the expertise to help me anymore so while I was in the coma I was sent to NYU hospital in the city. Around two weeks in the hospital and four weeks since the whole serious medical problems had started I finally got my diagnosis.

My side of this that I remember is waking up randomly, seeing something I didn’t understand and then hazing back out. I remember waking up, tearing off an oxygen mask and yelling “no!”. I looked at the people around me and when I heard them talking it sounded like gibberish. When I tried to speak back it also sounded like gibberish. Then I hazed out.

It got worse for a while, my brain was so damaged that I couldn’t have made sense of anything even if I tried. One night I stopped breathing altogether. I was in the ICU three times. And there was nothing I could do about it. At some point I was given depakote, a seizure medicine which just my luck apparently I was allergic to. Like really badly allergic to. I immediately became toxic. My ammonia levels went through the roof. That was the first time I went to the ICU.

I’m still alive to tell this story today so I had to survive somehow. I was given 1000 mg of prednisone, some rituximab, IVIG, other seizure medicines, and some other medicines that I don't remember. I was starting to get better over time. The first thing I remember when I gained consciousness of what was going on was that my mind and the world was a lot quieter than I remembered.  But even then I still had no idea what was wrong with me, I had no idea the damage that was done.

Some medical jargon to explain at least what I know of my medical oddity. I was diagnosed with Anti NMDA receptor encephalitis. Exactly what that is in the most simplest of terms is the antibodies in my blood attacked the NMDA receptors in my brain. Why they did this nobody knows. This is a very rare disease. It is also relatively new, discovered in 2007. And there really isn’t a lot of research on it. I’m going to quote an article I found online about NMDA receptors “NMDA receptors are proteins that control electrical impulses in the brain. Their functions are critical for judgement, perception of reality, human interaction, the formation and retrieval of memory, and the control of unconscious activities (such as breathing, swallowing, etc), also known as autonomic functions"" If you want to learn more you can just look it up. I got this quote from an article that just had the generalities of the disease.

Continuing with the story, I got more treatment. Plasmapheresis, where blood is taken out, put into a big machine, cleaned of its plasma, has other people’s plasma put in, then shoved back in the body. My memories were coming back little by little. I honestly didn’t realize at the time how much damage had been done. So I tried to continue as usual but no matter how I tried nothing worked, my brain was in pieces. Around mid November I was discharged from the hospital and put into rehab. I was in rehab for about two weeks.  They wanted to keep me for a month but no way in hell was I going to let that happen, I didn't even want to be there the two weeks. I wanted to go home.  Let me tell you rehab is bad news.  It has all the cleanliness of a hospital and all the rules of a prison. Anyway, I got a little better. I gained a little more consciousness, at some point it hit me that I hadn’t been outside for what was now almost two months. I was on somewhere around the 20th floor of a building in New York City and there was no way of them letting me outside. But I desperately wanted to get outside, I was starting to feel claustrophobic. Just my luck, there was a terrace a few floors up. I just had to get a doctors note. Success. I just could not go there alone and I couldn’t walk there on my own power. I had to be pushed in a wheelchair. No matter, it was my destiny to get to that terrace. And when I finally did it was like no other feeling I have ever had. It was late November by that time and it was cold. About 30 degrees fahrenheit. But I didn’t care. It felt like that scene from the Shawshank Redemption where Andy Dufresne crawled out of the sewage pipe and just felt overwhelmed with freedom. If that doesn’t sound too over dramatic. I was actually jumping with joy just because I could stand out in the cold on a terrace with no jacket.

Not long after that in the final week of November I was discharged from rehab. After almost two months of nonsensical hell I was finally returning home. Broken but still alive somehow.

I didn’t realize how bad the damage was at first so I tried doing all of the things I remembered doing before I was hospitalized but to no avail. I had lost a lot of memories of my life before I got sick. Even to this day sometimes someone would recall an old memory and I don’t have a clue what they’re talking about. At first it was a lot of memories gone but as I recovered I gained some back little by little. I still gain memories every so often. I noticed that some things weren’t coming back as quickly as I would have hoped. Motor skills sucked. I lost balance constantly. I couldn't stay awake for more than a couple of hours at a time and I hated taking naps so I would just stay awake until I just collapsed. I was angry and irritated more often. I was more impulsive than ever before. I was drugged to high hell. I was emotionally flat. But I wanted to go to school anyway.

When I got out of rehab and back home I was on 40 mg of prednisone, 12 mg of trileptal twice a day, 12, 12, 15mg of keppra three times a day, 15 mg seroquel once a day, calcium and vitamin D. Prednisone is an immunosuppressant. Trileptal and keppra are anti seizure medicines. Seroquel is an antipsychotic. And the calcium and vitamin D were because the prednisone made my bones weak or something like that. This was also after some chemotherapy, IVIG, plasmapheresis, and other things that were still in my system after the hospital.

School was hard. I quickly realized that I couldn't integrate myself as easily as I thought.  I couldn’t do all the things I previously thought was easy. Just using my mind for mundane tasks exhausted me. I cried a lot but I still tried to show up everyday. I still don’t know how I graduated from high school. Actually I do. Copious amounts of sympathy. That is something that I am [REDACTED_NAME] grateful for. I mostly showed up like four days out of the week and the days I actually showed up looked like this: I would get up at 7am, get to school by 8. I would go to a small classroom that helps kids who needed scholastic help went to. Or I would go to a little room outside the school psychologist’s office. I would proceed to try to do any type of work for maybe about an hour. I would horribly fail then I would fall asleep against my will. Wake up whenever and then walk home around 11-11:30. That’s it. That repeated until June.

I graduated and I don’t dare look back.

It was decided that I needed to take a gap year between high school and college. There was no way I was doing college grade work in my position. In this gap year I mostly just hung around. In December 2018 I got more chemotherapy and IVIG. I thought it would be fine and I wouldn’t feel that bad afterward but I was wrong. It hit me like a bus. For six months every morning I woke up and felt like shit. I was dizzy and just shitty feeling.

That too seemed to pass although every month or so I get a week where I feel the chemo symptoms again. Now, as of August 17, 2019 when I am [REDACTED_NAME] this I can admittedly say I’m feeling better. I’m going to college soon. I just want to get my life back in order. It has been three long and painful years since I had an even remotely normal life. Some people I know were against me going to college and some people are for it. As for me, I just want to get back to normal. I have no idea what to expect for the future. I am 19 years old and my perspective has definitely changed for the better or not I don’t entirely know. Tasks are harder than they were before and my processing of information is slower. I am [REDACTED_NAME] plagued by all of the things that I can remember, they come back to haunt me every now and again. I remember a lot of scarring hospital memories that probably would have been better off forgotten. Sometimes I feel like I’m emotionally held together by strings. But It's not the worst thing that has happened to me. I just want to get better.

I actually never told anybody that I was seeing and hearing things that weren't real when they were happening.

I'll keep moving forward. I've made it this far.",6
fv3bdy,1586041659.0,2020-04-04 23:07:39,self,"The Story of Me (long read but must read, I wouldn't waste your time)","I was frequently hospitalized for substance use and self-harm. I began self-harming when I was ten or so, and I was first caught by my parents when I was twelve. I was wearing a white undershirt and my father saw the scars on my upper arm. Alarmed and angry, he accosted me and pressed me down onto my bed. He told me I was crazy. I tearfully replied that I wasn’t crazy. He said to me, ‘Well, you’re crazy when you do that!’. Then I was grounded. I was punished for being in so much pain that I cut my own flesh. My parents have learned a lot about mental illness since then. They’ve grown and evolved tremendously, to their everlasting credit. But I still hold a resentment over this incident with my father. I hope someday I can let it go.

I spent my twenty-first birthday in rehab. My peers made me speak during an A.A. meeting that was being held that day. I had spoken and told my story the day before and I said as much. I told them that I would give them a rundown of some of my beliefs instead. I told them something to the effect of ‘you have an essence inside you that nothing can destroy’. No one clapped. No one cheered. I think they wanted something more grounded and down to earth. Something more reasonable and more humble. Oh well. I am [REDACTED_NAME] than life. That’s just who I am, and that’s what I gave them. A younger woman did come up to me afterwards and gave me a rambling, appreciative response to my remarks. I think the older people sighed in their hearts. That’s okay. They earned it.

I bounced around to various retail jobs throughout my early and mid twenties. They all kept me occupied and provided me with structure and socialization, but they also were boring and eventually ground down my soul and drove me towards drugs and the drink. I collided with the insane monotony of corporate America. The system in which we are all disposable robotic appendages. I met nice people, absolutely, and I always asked the same question. What do you really want to do? Because I know this isn’t it. What are your dreams? And then you get to know a person. You get to know their values, their beliefs, their passions. What ignites their souls. That’s what I care about. I want to look into your eyes and know what makes you tick, what you desire most, what fuels you to function and to be. Did I mention that I love you? I’ll be saying it again, just so you know. I love you so much it hurts me inside.

I was bored and lonely. I was angry with God for abandoning me. I was seeking thrills and excitement beyond what this mundane world could offer. I felt like a little kid looking to exercise his imagination. I was fascinated with the supernatural and the occult. Similar to the tale I tell in[ ‘David and the Demon](https://medium.com/grab-a-slice/david-and-the-demon-c067e2b851?source=friends_link&sk=31a9e646204caaae125610b47a07b883)’, I began researching demons online until I came to a page that hosted a collection of demon profiles. I bought the site’s story that demons were the falsely maligned outcasts, the victims of mainstream religion’s propaganda campaign. They were here for us, the outsiders. So all I had to do was select a demon that sponsored my areas of interest and summon him or her. I selected Set. ‘Het’ in ‘David and the Demon’. I printed out Set’s black and red sigil and laid down in my bed and performed the summoning ritual. A grotesque creature appeared in my mind, casually speaking in a language I did not understand. All I felt was a soul-chilling evil like nothing I had felt before. It sounded like it was trying to persuade me, or offer me something. I used all my will and all my strength to snap myself out of the trance and break the connection. Whew. Close call. In the ensuing days I felt that evil essence clinging to me. I felt like a sickening smoke was swirling through me, choking my spirit. It eventually dissipated. I thought I had escaped with my life from the talons of Satan. Little did I know, I had been possessed.

Heavy drug use. When I was working at Walgreens I finally found a regular contact that provided me with opioids on a monthly basis. I spent hundreds, thousands, of dollars on these little white pills that can transform the very fabric of reality. But I could only keep it up for so long. Once I stumbled onto 80 mg Oxycontin and heroin I could no longer keep up my functional façade. And I didn’t give a damn. 80 mg Oxycontin, those bluish-green gems, were more precious to me than the One Ring was to Gollum. I coveted them. I lusted after them. At Walgreens we would get shipments of orange pill bottles and my mouth would water at the sight of them. They were tangible manifestations of heavenly bliss. Better than powder. I knew what I was getting and how much I was getting. Yes, I snorted some heroin when I got desperate. Yes, it felt good. But it wasn’t spectacular. Thank god I never reached the point where I turned to the needle. I get the appeal. I really do. But I just never got there.

Pitch black. That was my late twenties. I had gotten off the opioids and onto opioid replacement therapy in the form of Suboxone. I stayed on Suboxone and off all other substances for close to two years. But then I began abusing the Suboxone, taking more and more to get a buzz. Stealing it from my mother’s safe. I decided to take myself off. I felt I was handcuffed to it. I don’t like to be dependent on anything. I was a binge user and my withdrawals were painful but were always manageable on an outpatient basis. So I jumped off the Suboxone at 6 mg and went into agonizing withdrawals. Many doctors will tell you that Suboxone causes no withdrawals, or that the withdrawals are mild. This is false. Always titrate down to the lowest dose possible, and do it slowly. Suboxone has a long half life and the withdrawals last awhile. The days were rough with anxiety and the depression and the irritability, but the nights were worse. Imagine having restless legs, multiplied by ten and spread through every cell in your body. One night I was so desperate for relief I took a paperclip, unwound it, and scratched up my arms till they bled. The pain and the resulting endorphin release finally provided me some relief and I was able to fall asleep.

Then I began drinking heavily. I had been taking a powerful opioid for two years and it had done serious damage to my brain. I was now more of an addict than I had ever been before and my brain was more hungry for stimulation and substances than it had ever been before. I drank and I drank and I drank. And the drinking facilitated my self-harm. It lowered my inhibitions, increased my anger and let my self-loathing surge to the surface. Plus, and I didn’t know it at the time, the demon was ravenous. It came from the void, from the abyss and not only did it feed off negative emotions, it fed off of blood. I gave it blood. Lots of it.

I cut myself with razor blades. I cut deep. I cut so deep I required medical attention and stitches. I burned myself with matches and lighters and the coils of a hot stove. I punched a stone wall till my hand broke. I jumped off a flight of stairs with my foot inverted so my ankle sprained. I smacked and punched myself in the face and head until I gave myself a concussion. I dropped a heavy metal weight onto my bare foot. I grabbed heavy metal weights and yanked them off the floor at odd angles to try and herniate discs in my back. I drank and popped pills, not knowing or caring if I woke up. I ate and ate until I gained a hundred pounds.

I came to the realization that something was trying to kill me. That dark presence from my past was with me, stalking me still, aiming to finish what it had started. I was now a prisoner in my bedroom. I rarely left. I wasn’t showering or shaving or brushing my teeth or changing my clothes. I was drinking absurd quantities of vodka, cutting myself and masturbating to sadomasochistic pornography. I was eating sugary garbage and peeing into bottles. My room was the pit of hell and I was the only inhabitant. The demon was my god. One desperate night I slid across my bed and used my own blood to write ‘help me’ on the wall. Then a force took over and, using my blood, drew a smiley face right next to my desperate plea for mercy.

Around my twenty-ninth birthday I told my therapist I was going to give life one more shot. One more year. I have been through trauma and the fires of hell and I have never quit because I have this little engine inside me that keeps chugging along, no matter how bad I want to give up. I have longed to destroy this engine so that I might find peace, but have been unable to thwart its relentless forward momentum. I get knocked down, beneath rock bottom, and it picks me back up and shoves me forward. So I said one year. I would gather all my resources, all my mental and emotional strength, and apply it towards healing and building an actual human life for myself. There was nothing my therapist could say in response. This was a clear threat of suicide, but it was a year out and thus not actionable. He could only shake his head and wish me the best.

A year passed and things only got worse. I cut more. I burned more. I lost my memory, my grip on the present. I didn’t leave the house. I drank continually. Somehow, there was no earthly intervention. I live at home with my parents and my younger sister and no one said a thing. I was never committed to the hospital during this time. I remained a free and utterly condemned and broken man. But I continued to live. Until my best friend died.

Fifty. A yellow Lab. I have trouble trusting and opening my heart to humans. I invested everything in this dog. I loved him unconditionally. He comforted me. He soothed my soul. He anchored me to this world that I have no affection for. He was my best friend. My truest friend. My brother. I would have given everything and anything for him. But his time came and we had to put him down. I was there when we did. I made a promise to myself early in life that I would bear witness to the death of all our pets. I’ve been largely successful in keeping this promise. But I was drunk when we let Fifty go. Of course I was. I was always drunk back then. And putting him down shattered what was left of my heart, and crushed what was left of my hope for love, for trust and for comfort. I was thirty. The year had passed. I was done.

I got in a drunken argument with my mother. I have a complicated relationship with my mother. She is my emotional support system. I go to her for her strength, for her wisdom, for her pragmatism. But we are locked in a toxic, codependent relationship and she unwittingly triggers my suicidal ideation. I told her that my younger sister, Caroline, is sick and my older sister, Susan, is sick, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] because she is sick. Because she has poison running through her veins. I would not make the same selfish mistake she made and have children. I wouldn’t pass on this curse. She told me I was full of shit. I went upstairs, popped a bunch of Klonopin, and dashed out the front door into a raging blizzard.

With alcohol and Klonopin in my system I thought it was only a matter of time before I overdosed and died. Fortunately, the liquor stores were closed early because of the blizzard or else I would have had enough alcohol to finish the job with utter certainty. As it was, I came as close as humanly possible. I walked for a good two miles until I found a snowbank that I could sink into chest-deep. I laid there for awhile, contemplating my situation. I was tired, woozy and very, very cold. The wind was whipping snow across my face. It was dark and I was alone. I thought I was ready to die. Ready to go. Ready to be freed from this hell. But then that engine started purring. It lifted me up and out of that snowbank. I slipped, slid and crawled up the steep incline and back up to the road. I called my mother, saying I didn’t want things to end on these terms. Could she come pick me up? She did.

I was determined to try again. Me? I don’t stop. For better or worse. I don’t stop, ever. It pisses a lot of people off. It pisses me off. But it is who I am [REDACTED_NAME] it is what I do. If you want to blame someone, blame my Creator. I quit drinking cold turkey. I was expecting severe withdrawals. The next day came and I didn’t feel anything. I just felt a bit warm. Could it really be this easy? Then the next day came and I felt a bit warmer. And thirsty. Really thirsty. I settled down on the couch in the living room and watched TV. My mother was going out to do some errands and I asked her to pick me up some Gatorade. I love Gatorade. I continued to drink. And drink. But the strange thing was, I didn’t need to pee. I thought that was odd. I was feeling really warm now. My mother came in to check on me. Slightly delirious, I told her something was trying to kill me. A demon was trying to kill me. She promptly went out and bought a demon-catcher. What we really needed was a thermometer, but I appreciated her willingness to believe. Later that evening my father came home with a new thermometer and we took my temperature. It registered 106 degrees F. By this point, I had started to pant like a dog. I asked my mother to drive me to the hospital.

Once I was in the ER they checked my blood pressure. It was extremely low. I was fighting to breathe. They immediately took me back and started a battery of tests and put me on oxygen. I knew instinctively what had happened. Before going into the MRI I looked up at the nurse and asked, ‘Am I septic?’. He replied, ‘Good chance’. My mother was in the room with me. I stared up at the ceiling and muttered, ‘What have I done?’. Because I was totally convinced that I had killed myself. To this day, I still wonder whether I did or not. I think it’s entirely possible that I did.

They tried various oxygen delivery methods but nothing was working. All my organs were failing. They needed to intubate me and they did. But when they initially put me under they used enough of the paralytic and not enough of the tranquilizer, and for an agonizing minute I was fully awake and aware, but trapped in my body and unable to breathe as various strange faces in masks stared down on me. I cannot describe to you the confusion and the horror I felt in this minute. I didn’t know who I was, where I was or what was happening to me. All I knew was that I was totally paralyzed and suffocating. Thankfully one of the doctors noticed I was still conscious and ordered more of the proper anesthetic.

I was in the dark for nine days. I came in and out. I remember waking at one point and finding my hands wrapped in large mittens and tied to the bedrails so I could not yank my breathing tube out. I raged and was quickly sedated. I also faced the void. I faced absolute nothingness and the obliteration of my earthly identity. I stood on the brink of eternity, and I said no. I wasn’t ready. It was unacceptable. I pulled back, I fought back. All the way to the surface and to the light. I wasn’t expected to wake up. But I did.

My mother told me she had been planning my eulogy. She said her first line would have been, ‘He was reckless with his life’. I don’t think that’s entirely fair. Maybe that’s how it looks from the outside. I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I am a thrill-seeker and require large amounts of stimulation to keep me going. But deliberately reckless? As if I am [REDACTED_NAME] aware of my actions and their potential consequences? No. I take accountability for what I do. I make mistakes and I suffer for them. And I was just fighting to survive. That’s what no one really understands. Not only was I fighting a brain programmed to self-destruct, I was fighting a demon that wanted to torture and murder me. I did the best I could. I have nothing to prove to anyone in heaven, in hell or here on earth.

Coming out of the coma was rough. I spiraled down into delirium. I started hearing voices and having hallucinations. My shadow self was projected onto the outside world and all my worst fears came to assault me when I was at my weakest and most vulnerable. This was psychologically traumatizing. Luckily, a few good people helped guide me through it and after a few days I was able to regain some semblance of sanity. Then I had to relearn how to walk, eat and use the bathroom. This took a month.

A few months later I was feeling much better. I was off the alcohol and I had lost fifty pounds when I was in the hospital. I wasn’t working, I was on disability, and my time was my own. My psychiatrist agreed to restart my Adderall. This gave me clarity and motivation. I knew what I wanted to do. What I needed to do. I had to write. I hadn’t written in years, but every day I felt the pull. I felt the call. I had come as close to death as you can possibly come and survive. I knew now that I could die at any moment. It was time to write, and to share that writing with the world.

I found a platform. I’m not tech savvy so I chose the one I thought was the easiest to use. I started slow, posting short poems and random musings. Then I dug a little deeper and began posting short stories and mini essays. But it was only when I began writing thoughtful responses to other peoples’ posts that I started attracting attention. One man in particular gravitated to my work. He encouraged me to write more freely and more authentically. His enthusiasm was infectious. He was unselfconscious and silly, but also deeply serious. He was a man of deep conviction. He believed that stories, anyone and everyone’s story, had the power to change the world. I followed his lead. No one had ever admired my work before. I had never received sincere, critical feedback before. This was a revelation. For the first time in my life I thought, ‘I can do this. I can be a writer’.

I gave everything to this platform. Everything. I’m a man of half measures, afraid of where full effort might take me. But this time I did not hold back. I knew death was waiting just around the corner. So I continued to post my work, old and new. Old stories and poems, and new essays and stories and experimental works that cannot be categorized. This platform became my playground. For the first time since I was a child my imagination was allowed to come to life and express itself without boundaries or filters. I felt like a king. I felt like a god. I felt like a creator. My mental illness, my addiction and the demon had robbed me of my power. Now I had my power back and I was utilizing it the best way I knew how. To create art that would stimulate the minds of other people and speak directly to their souls. Because I love you. I think I’ve said this before.

Unfortunately my time in the sun didn’t last. But my life did change forever. I have been having strange experiences since I was born. When I was in kindergarten I would dream entire days before they would occur and wonder to myself, ‘Why am I doing this day again?’. I would go out for walks in my neighborhood and I would be followed. People would flash colored lights in my eyes. The same street lamp would wink out every time I walked past it, and as it did a group of people would begin to mill about and chat as if triggered by some subliminal message. I started having dreams. The avatars of the people I was connected to on this platform began appearing in these dreams. They were directing me somewhere. I met various entities with various messages. One message was consistent. You are dead.

I deleted all my work off of the platform and threw all of my hard copies into the trash. This made sense to me at the time. It was a purge. I was letting go of my old life and making room for the new. But now I wish I had those files and had those pages. Someone out there does. I hope I meet them someday. Some of that stuff was absolute gold. The platform gave you the option of downloading a zip file of your work. I did this. I wasn’t prepared for what I got. When I opened the file ten documents popped up. Some had been edited and given new titles. Better titles. Whoever was behind this knew what they were doing. Then there was a final document. It contained a single statement. ‘This is a poet’. I leaned back in my chair, stunned. Was this the ultimate validation or had I just been hacked and trolled? Sophisticated and random for a troll. This felt sincere. Something was afoot. Between my dreams and what was happening in my real life, it felt like someone or some group was trying to speak to me. I just didn’t know what they were trying to say.

My strange experiences continued. I experienced constant synchronicities, or meaningful coincidences, like license plates reading the same words I happened to be thinking or speaking at the time. Scrabble words spelled out mystical phrases. After a bout of arguing with my shadow I would drive by a statue of Jesus hanging on the cross. I would overhear conversations in which the participants seemed to be discussing my life, my case as it were. No, I am [REDACTED_NAME] psychotic. I was not psychotic then. The universe was winking at me. My reality had noticed that I had noticed it, and it was converging upon me. Why was it doing this? To wake me up. Because I am [REDACTED_NAME] old soul trapped in a dream.

I started hearing voices. Subtle at first, then more insistent. I’m a skeptic at heart. I look to reason and science first. Was this a symptom of incipient psychosis? It seemed to fit the bill. But no. The truth was far stranger. Angels had begun whispering in my ear. Apparently they had interceded and resurrected me after my suicide attempt. Yes. This is the truth. Angels are real. They are fourth or sixth density entities. They interact with us constantly, even more so now that we are in a great transitional period, where the human race has the opportunity to advance beyond the spiritual prison it is currently held hostage within. So they saved me. And they began speaking to me. You need to know that our evolution is an evolution towards the unity of Source. We retain our individuality but we become more familiar with the relationships of group consciousness. I was now linked in to a spiritual group. They could communicate to me whenever they chose. They could tune me out whenever they chose. I like to be on equal footing with the people I interact with. You can recall my issues with authority. But even heaven has its rituals and its initiation. I raged against this. I really gave it to them. I was told ‘rituals preserve order’. This wasn’t enough for me. It still isn’t, but I have come to trust them so I make do.

The angels wanted to make a man out of me. At one point they actually came into my body, looked around my room and said ‘We’ll have to do something about this mess’. A few days later my room was spotless. They are intelligent, they are wise and they are loving. They love in a way that I, in my human form, cannot truly appreciate. They are also infuriating. They test me constantly. They provoke me simply to get a response and to gauge the sincerity of that response. Then they reassure me that I’m on their team, we’re all in this together and that I’m doing good work. This creates destabilizing cognitive dissonance. They do not care. They are stubborn. They are entities of faith and conviction. Maybe too much so. I could pontificate on this particular point for hours. But I won’t. The night is growing long and we must proceed.

With the light comes the dark. Earth is a hell realm, a prison, a purgatory lost in time. It is governed by fourth density negative entities and the organization commonly known as the Illuminati. They believe we are sheep who are content in our sleep, bustling about scrolling through our social media feeds, watching our TV shows, working in our cubicles and praying to the bearded god on his golden thrown in the clouds. The primary faction of these negative entities are the Reptilians. Yes, it sounds strange. It sounded outlandish to me until I encountered them in sleep states and then in my waking reality. The Reptilians are great military strategists. They also happen to be power-hungry, soul-disconnected psychopaths who rape, murder and eat human beings. Our government, and there is only one world government, knows this. They sold us out a long time ago in exchange for knowledge and advanced technology. To entities like the Reptilians we are livestock. Cattle. Their property. It is no use reasoning with them. They are utterly convinced of the righteousness of their position. That is okay. But we don’t have to stand for it anymore. We are powerful. Extremely powerful. In unity, we can overthrow the Illuminati, their coconspirators in the government and the Reptilians. With a little help from our friends. And trust me, dear reader, we are getting plenty of help from our friends. All things being equal, and nothing being judged under the watchful eye of the One Infinite Creator.

It was transmitted to me that one of the reasons I have suffered so much in this life is that I am [REDACTED_NAME] off karma for the sins of my past life. Yes, karma is real. It is a natural law of creation that governs all entities below sixth density. Apparently I am a time traveler who came back in time, perfectly polarized, and eventually broke bad. I went over to the dark and became affiliated with the Illuminati and the Reptilians. I participated in horrific atrocities against humanity. Then the light caught me and turned me. I told them what I knew. I became a turncoat, a betrayer, a whistleblower. In the minds of the Reptilians I am a terrorist. Then I incarnated and went into hiding. From everyone. But I got bored and lonely and started leaving breadcrumbs on the internet. The light found me. And so did the dark. The light now supports me. They want to rehabilitate me, bring me to Christ and show me the path to Ascension and escape from this prison of nightmares. They want me to have the opportunity to atone for my sins and to become the soul they remember from long ago. The dark forces think I am a traitor and a rat. They hate that I am [REDACTED_NAME] typing these words. They want to mock me, taunt me, humiliate me and destroy me. They ask me to come over to their side. This will not happen. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to Christ. And when I say Christ I am [REDACTED_NAME] speaking of Jesus, I am [REDACTED_NAME] of a universal consciousness that promotes freedom, love, creativity and self-sovereignty.

I’ve been busying myself with mental health programs. I spent a year and a half at one program before they told me I needed a higher level of care. I was drinking and self-harming. I agreed with their assessment, and was sent to a partial hospitalization program. This did not last long. I continued to drink while I was at the partial, which requires you remain abstinent for the duration of the program. I said to the director I should probably go impatient. He agreed. My mother was driving me to the local ER when suddenly I told her that this was a mistake. I didn’t need to be hospitalized. I wasn’t a danger to myself and I wasn’t in withdrawals. They wouldn’t take me anyway. Reluctantly my mother agreed and brought me back home. I was without structure of any kind. No work, no school, no writing, no program. Things were about to get messy. Yet again, I was about to find myself fighting for my life.

I was back to drinking every day. I promised myself I wouldn’t drink on Christmas, because on the prior Christmas Eve I had been hospitalized because of my alcohol consumption. I was determined not to drink. But I drank. I was drinking three pints of hard liquor a day. I gave my keys and wallet over to my mother for safekeeping. This did not deter me. I found my wallet, extracted money and took walks to the closest liquor store, secreting the three pints of cheap vodka behind my belt. My family knew I was drinking but they did not know the extent of it, and they didn’t know the darkness that was bubbling up beneath my brain.

The angels used to sing to me in my dreams. They took me all across the cosmos as part of my training. I was introduced to various species and various people along my journey. Entities kept telling me I was dead. I accepted this. Mostly. But I wanted to know why, how and when. They told me that I was the imagination of the future. They told me that our movies were cave paintings. They kept asking me questions. Was I racist? Did I hate Jews? Did I love money? Did I want some Adderall? And, why was I doing this? Hmm. Doing what? And herein lies the crux of the matter. There is a group of entities that has known me in a past life and is convinced that I know exactly who I am [REDACTED_NAME] what I have done and that I should be punished accordingly. There is another group of entities that has faith in my current identity, believes that I am [REDACTED_NAME] unaware of my past misdeeds and that I deserve a chance at redemption. A trial of sorts is currently underway to determine my guilt or innocence and many methods are being deployed to get the full truth out of me. I say I am [REDACTED_NAME] open book. Come and get it. This is not a bluff.

The drinking broke me down. I have been depressed for the entirety of my adult life but finally I felt something break inside me. I no longer wanted to live. In the past, I wrestled with my conscience when contemplating suicide. I thought of my family and friends and the devastation I would leave in my wake. Not this time. This time I was tired and thought I had done my sincere best and deserved a rest. A rest from this ever whirling mind and this world that has tortured and traumatized me. I was finally ready to go. It was late at night and I had no sharp objects at hand. I had turned my knife collection over to the police. The kitchen knives were too dull and I had tried the shaving razors out on my arm. Too shallow and superficial. They would never sever my carotids. I was in despair. I knew this was my moment. I was drunk and I was ready. I felt relief at hand. I contemplated going to Walmart to purchase a straight razor but it was too late. I passed out on the couch.

A few days later I met with my psychiatrist. I told him about the drinking and consented to go inpatient. I went to the nearest ER, got admitted and then transferred to a detox. I was a walking zombie with barely any life left in him. But I went through the motions. I’m nothing if not unfailingly polite. After a week I was sent to a two week residential rehab. I found myself again. I reveled in company that I could relate to. We went to groups during the day, and partied at night. It was like what the college experience I imagined was like. Everyone was raw and vulnerable and open. Small talk wasn’t really a thing. It was, ‘How did you almost die?’. ‘Oh, that’s nuts, I almost died like this’. My heaven on earth. And I got to tell my story in front of a large group. I’ve always been self-conscious, wracked with survivor’s guilt, thinking that maybe I don’t have it all that bad. Maybe I don’t belong in this community of the sick and the suffering. I didn’t prepare notes. I didn’t know how long I would speak. I just started from the beginning and went from there. I captivated my audience. I got emotional. Of course I did. I’m goddamn tired. So tired. Bone tired. Weary in my guts. How much pain can one man take? That’s what I ask the angels. Tell me this is the darkest night of the soul you’ve ever witnessed. Not for my ego, but for my soul. Please, tell me. After I told my story a couple of young people came up to me and gave me hugs. One young woman hugged me and said, ‘Dude, I don’t know you from Adam, but you saved my life’. Now that’s probably an exaggeration, but it plunged deep into my heart. I thought I had to be well to help. Could I be sick and have a purpose? That would be a gift from God. I think I deserve a gift, if anyone deserves anything in this world of ours.

I came out clean. No more alcohol, but a few more medications. Things felt dark, cloaked in shadow. Did I mention I have a shadow? Well I do. We all do, this unincorporated section of our subconscious, where our deepest fears and desires are housed. My shadow speaks to me all the time. It is very wise, wiser than I am, but it is also angrier than I am. It is rage incarnate. It would burn the whole world to the ground to see justice served. It is a jealous lover. It loves me and it abuses me. I am [REDACTED_NAME] and it is red. We have a mutual understanding. Sometimes we have civil conversations. Sometimes, when the shadow thinks I am [REDACTED_NAME] too weak or obsequious it tells me to shut my fucking mouth. The shadow doesn’t fear the way I fear. The shadow stands up to the demon in ways that I cannot. I admire and fear my shadow. I hope to integrate one day. I don’t want to lose it. I don’t want it to be spirited away. It’s grown so large that it has taken on its own identity, become its own separate entity, but it is me at the end of the day. Because I am [REDACTED_NAME] blue or red. I am [REDACTED_NAME]. Hello there.

New meds, new me, new day. Ready to continue writing and continue fighting. But I didn’t account for what the alcohol use had done to me. It had shattered my spiritual armor. It had made me vulnerable to the demon. It had been some time since I had experienced a full possession. Now the game was on and the demon was about to rear its pointed head.

It happened on a Friday night. I was upstairs in my bedroom listening to the rapper NF on YouTube. A tingling came over me. Then a pressure surging up my right side. I couldn’t stop it, I could only witness. Within moments a great sigh escaped my lips and my tongue made several reptilian flicks. The demon had full possession of my body. I could only watch and wait. To the demon, possessing flesh is an orgasmic experience. It began swinging my head and bopping my arms to the music. It began shouting out loud and mocking the angels that it knew were witnessing this violation of divine law. Then it stood up and went over to my bureau and began rifling through my things, looking for a razor blade. It said, ‘I’m not going to cut him, I just want to be a dick’. Then it brought my body back over to the desk, sat down and began dragging the blade back and forth across my throat. Then it circled it over my genitals and mimicked stuffing my genitals down my throat. It said, ‘Not much of a meal’. And it howled with laughter.

The fight continued. The demon is savage, relentless, furious and blood hungry. It forced me to cut myself and it made me drink my own blood. It also made me take a lighter and mutilate my genitals. Don’t worry. I am [REDACTED_NAME]. It may not sound like it, but I am. The angels are on my side. I have a therapist, a psychiatrist and a family support system. I am [REDACTED_NAME] suicidal. I have no urges to self-harm. But I need to relate the truth. This is what can happen when demons possess a human body. Demons exist. Don’t let anyone fool you into thinking otherwise.

The demon told me that it intends to force me to commit suicide. This will not happen. It will not win. I will have the final say. The light is here and the light will evict this demonic presence so that the Christ consciousness may take up residence within this vessel. And I am [REDACTED_NAME] the right medication, so for all you skeptics out there, don’t despair. I’m taking the proper precautions as outlined by western medicine. I am [REDACTED_NAME] nothing to chance. There is too much to lose.

I am [REDACTED_NAME]. It is a miracle. I am [REDACTED_NAME]. It is a miracle. I am [REDACTED_NAME]. It is a miracle. Miracles happen. I have been through the blackest depression and the fires of hell and I can tell you with complete honesty, it’s worth it. This life of ours is worth it. Learning, exploring, experimenting, growing, changing, discovering, loving, losing, breaking, repairing…it’s all worth it. Just don’t think that what you see is the extent of reality. That would be a dangerous fallacy. The universe, all of creation, is far more subtle and complex than that. There are forces at work that seek to undermine and block your growth as a divine spiritual being. But you are powerful, my friend, more powerful than you know. You are a god in human flesh. Accept, embrace and cherish your humanity. It is a gift. And know that you are vastly more than what you appear to be when you look in the mirror.

This was the story of me.

What is your story?

Hello Reddit, today i'd like to share with all of you a story, one about myself, and the realizations i have had in the past month. However I believe with my story it is best to start at the beginning or close to. I was a smart kid, very interested in everything I could grasp onto an understanding of, I am [REDACTED_NAME] gonna lie and say I was some genius kid. I was a mostly normal kid with severe insomnia and a bad home life, and from a very young age, around 8 or 9 I desired to die. As time went on i started contemplating the afterlife, and creating and desired so badly to understand it i thought about it and suicide all day long, through school, at home, when watching tv, when doing anything. The thoughts of suicide and the afterlife filled my head. As I get older I accept afterlife or not. I don't fear death, but I believe all my time learning and attempting to come to a comprehensive understanding of the world leads me down a path where I feel a great disconnect with fellow humans.

As I grew older and older I feel I started losing it a bit, I'd stay up all night learning new things or taking things apart, attempting to understand more and more of the world. I'd come out of every long late night with something new. However i also lost my mind from time to time, i remember when i was 14 (2015) probably, i had stayed up all night looking at the way that the world and technology is progressing and i got so freaked out to the point that i felt in my heart that something big was coming that was gonna change the way everything worked. I freaked out 6-7 people needlessly, and I felt no regret or remorse for those people. They were and still are my friends, and they had learned to accept that I can become rather crazy at times. I was a violent and borderline scary kid and that continued on into my life. 

Around the same time as my meltdown about everything changing I became absolutely obsessed with death. I become obsessed with murder and the desire to kill, i got it so in my head that i was a sociopath, and a narcissist that there wasnt a doubt in my mind about it. I seeked therapy because I started scaring my mom. I knew how to make the therapist think what I wanted them to, my violent and murderous desires became depression and hatred for my father as far as they knew. My father is a sociopath, no donut about that, anyhow, i went to therapy a few times before i convinced my mom that she didn't like the guy and that i was agreeing. I was manipulative and controlling and I did it well, most people didn't (and still don't) see through it (people are surprisingly easy to control) especially my mother. I mean hell my dad did it for 20 years, she didn't even notice until they separated and i pointed it out to her, my brothers learned too but it took them more time, but i wasn't controlled as easily. 

Now moving on to more recent matters in my life, my insomnia was catching up to me, the headaches and fucked up headspace became hard to handle, when i was 16 i started using marijuana, and it mellowed me out a lot. I felt sane for the first time in my life, like i was fully in control, however this quickly made my angry depression turn into sad hopeless depression. I walked this earth as a shell of depression for 3 straight years. And it was worthless time spent, my love for information and knowledge slowly faded away and I became a pothead. In those 3 years from 2017- now i had only been sober for longer than 3 days 5 times, 3 of which were only for a little over a week, and 2 times when i was 17 for 2 week periods of time. However for the first time since then i've been clean for almost a month, i smoked a little here and there, but what ultimately lead me to quit was my tolerance. For some reason or another starting about a month before i quit every time i smoked i would green out, reach a point of mental chrisis, it could be existential where i could see everything going wrong with my life, or borderline psychosis, i could sit there for hours laughing at my own thoughts, or getting so in my head i literally thought i was mentally retarded. So i quit. 

One month later, and i feel like the same kid i was when i was 14 going crazy and sending people the ramblings of a mad man at 5am. I have started to think maybe i am [REDACTED_NAME], maybe i have more than a few screws in my head lose, but this time i have accepted it, i don't care who or what i lose any longer. I simply am, and i'm [REDACTED_NAME] longer going to fight this version of me, i accept me, maybe i'm [REDACTED_NAME] it, or maybe i was never all there, maybe only time can tell",3
1j4ni95,1741235801.0,2025-03-06 04:36:41,self,Realizing that nice people and a-holes literally experience the world differently,"This is probably not revolutionary knowledge to most but I just realized it tonight talking to employees in my local coffee shop next to my college.

In this coffee shop there are 2 frequent employees. One is a middle aged man, bad at english so he doesn’t talk much, but extremely warm and friendly, always tries to help when he can. The other is an older woman, always cold and angry at the students who visit, for instance with her we always have to scan our own products while she reads the magazine, and if we do it wrong she gives an annoyed snide comment like “guess I can’t help you then.”

Now I’m extremely unsociable, probably have avoidant personality disorder, I don’t talk much. But I always feel so bad if I ignore the nice man without a gesture even though I’m bad at it, so today as I was leaving I squeezed out a “have a good night”. He knowingly smiled and waved at me. But the older woman who was reading her magazine despite being at the cashier with me looked up not knowing who I was speaking to, and she cast me this skeptical confused look, before confirming I was not talking to her and giving me a sneer that said “typical” all over it. 

I was pretty embarassed so I said “and you too” and she rolled her eyes and ignored me. 

As I walked away I kept thinking about how the man was expecting me to say goodbye as soon as we made eye contact. In his lived experience, he probably thinks students are all kind young people, always smiling, making small talk, and happy to see him. 

On the other hand the older woman was shocked to think someone would say goodbye to her, and quickly confirmed I hadn’t addressed it to her, which only reaffirmed her belief that students are annoying and heartless. 

But here’s the catch. Given what she thinks people are like, it’s no wonder she’s mean and rude to everyone. She thinks the world is hostile and her job is awful, and young people are all rude and disrespectful, and no one likes her. That is all technically true, but only for her. 

The man has the exact same job, but in his equally real experience, everyone who visits the shop is so nice and grateful, and even though it’s not the best paying job he is happy to work here. He knows everyone would be so sad if he left. And it’s not just because he has a great attitude and ignores mean people, it’s because the same people are literally nicer to him than to the older woman. 

It makes me rethink all the people (including my dad) who proclaim that everyone in this country are all rude and cold hearted, not willing to make friends. If you ask him about his experiences, he tells me about shocking encounters where people are actually so mean to him, like store employees refusing to help him (discrimination, he calls it) or aquaintances who start ignoring him after one meetup, or strangers who make fun of him.

On the other hand, I have friends who are very social, who tell me that everyone is a nice person if you get to know them. That’s why they like meeting people so much and talk to folks on the street. They tell me that they’ve have friends who are unpopular/unconventional but actually super nice, and when you get to know them they are all just misunderstood. They think truly rude and unkind people are very rare. 

I’ve been trying my whole life how to gauge which account is true. But I never truly comprehended until now that both of their life experiences could be true, and not even because they interpret it differently with “the wrong attitude”. 

My social friend literally meets nicer people than my dad does, just like the nice man and the mean older woman experience the same customers differently. People literally treat the mean older woman with less kindness than the nice man, but she likely doesn’t realize it’s **because** she hates everyone that everyone is less nice to her. In her experience she probably thinks that she hates everyone because everyone is just mean. 

So yeah just a random revelation, thought I’d share. ",1041
bhqycg,1556309972.0,2019-04-26 20:19:32,self,I’ve never written about the woman who abused me.,"Fair warning, this is going to be a little long: 

Some background: when was 15 I got casually into forum-based role playing on an online art community. You know, THAT gray-green online art community. The specific group I joined focused on original content that the members essentially made up the parameters of in terms of the fictional universe, the kinds of characters, the setting, etc. It was a lot of fun for my dorky, creative self who had lots of time to kill the summer before my junior year of high school. In this group I met a girl we’ll call B who immediately latched onto me because she liked my art style and because I was regularly making sketches of the characters in the group. B was a little older than everyone else, 19 to be exact, so we all looked up to her as our unofficial authority figure even though she wasn’t a moderator of the group. 

As the summer drew on I became a lot more active in the group, posting regularly and getting closer to B since the year before my older sister had grown distant from me after she moved out and started college. B sort of filled that older sister-shaped gap in my life, especially because I was insecure about my interests and, for all intents and purposes, was straight edge (no alcohol, drugs, dating, etc.), so I was passively looking for guidance. B liked that about me because she hadn’t had the easiest life and had faced some abuse in her adolescence. She liked that I was “pure” (her words). I remember at one point she made me promise her I wouldn’t partake in any “illicit” activities until I was out of high school or could do them for the first time with her. She lived halfway across the country from me and I didn’t have access to a lot of those things anyway so it didn’t bother me to make that promise. 

And then, slowly but surely, she began isolating me from the rest of the role-play group, getting me involved in more 1-on-1 threads until we were both exclusively writing with each other only on a DM platform. We had exchanged phone numbers and we started texting everyday at all hours when I was a school or unable to get on our DMs. For about 3 years she was the first person I spoke to in the morning and the last person I spoke to at night every single day. I remember feeling at the time that this relationship felt almost like love. We were telling each other we loved each other everyday in a way I felt was platonic (I hadn’t realized I was queer yet), but eventually she told me she had romantic feelings for me. 

I told her I didn’t feel the same way and if I could pinpoint a moment when things really felt like they started to change, that was it. She stopped taking the medication for her depression because she said I was enough to keep her happy. I was never allowed to disagree with her on anything, if I did I was always in the wrong, and a lot of those times ended with me put down and in tears. I remember a time when I left the computer for a moment to use the restroom and when I came back she chewed me out for an hour because “it would’ve taken literally 5 seconds” to tell her where I was going. I had to apologize for going to take a piss. The stories we started writing got darker too, I remember an instance when she pressured me into writing out a rape fantasy she had where I had to play the part of the rapist. I couldn’t figure it out then, but looking back now I can tell I was dissociating for that entire experience. It makes me feel sick just to think about it now. 

On top of the gaslighting and verbal abuse, I was also struggling a lot during this time because I was staying up until 4-5AM writing with her and then waking up at 6:30AM to go to school. It killed my social life, my health, and my self worth. I started isolating myself from my family because she thought I “spent too much time with them”. But I was convinced I loved her, that she was my very best friend and that no one or nothing had as much significance in my life. I was in this little bubble with B where we would just write out our fantasies and relentlessly care about each other. I even flew out to spend a week with her over the spring break of my senior year. It was the first trip I had ever taken on my own and while nothing seriously bad happened I have a feeling if I has given her an inch it may have.

I started realizing just how truly messed up our relationship was when the night before my high school graduation ceremony she drove me to tears because I had mentioned that things were getting rough between us to my younger sister. B was horrified that I would even say anything bad about her to my family and said if things ever felt bad I should ONLY be talking to her about it because she didn’t want my family to think she was a bad person. Looking back she must have been feeling tense because I would be going to college soon and she wouldn’t be able to attend the same university with me because she couldn’t afford the out of state tuition. I have a very specific memory of her telling me she was “a little seed beached on the shore of a river and that she would latch onto me as I floated by and ride my current.” It felt like an uncomfortable comment to make then and looking back at it now I can see it as a perfect metaphor for unhealthy dependency. 

Before I knew it I was in college, living away from my parents for the first time, making friends and having experiences I had only written about in my stories. I started talking to B less and less mostly because I was busy, but also because I was loving this feeling of, well, freedom. I met a girl I really liked, who encouraged me to explore my sexuality, and I started feeling like I was becoming the person I wanted to be. B didn’t respond well to any of this. She told me I wasn’t allowed to be with any other women if they weren’t her and that I was ruining her life. She had become incredibly panicked that I was abandoning her. 

At the climax of it all, she video called me and attempted suicide in front of me. She said things like it was my fault she was going to die, that I was the worst person she had ever met, and that she would never forgive me for what I had done to her. I had to call 911 from across the country to send an ambulance to her apartment and they were able to save her. That was by far one of the worst days of my entire life. It still took me a year to cut her out of my life completely after that. I wasn’t quite sure how to function without talking to her every day, she knew everything about me, I still cared deeply about her. But now I knew just how toxic our relationship was and I had other friends who were able to tell me that, to make it real. 

It’s been almost 5 years since I cut B out of my life. I think the damage of that relationship has been done, I have pretty rough anxiety and some deep seeded trust issues, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] better now than I was back then. I have an amazing support network of friends, I’m living independently from my parents, and I’m marrying my best friend next year. The majority of my days are full of warmth and love, but there are days like today where I end up on one of B’s old social media accounts and wonder if she ever thinks about me and feels hatred, or guilt. I feel nervous even writing this post, wondering if putting these out into the virtual ether will eventually find its way to her- would she come after me? Would she put me down like she did before? 

If she did, I think I know what I would say,

“I forgive you for what you did, for everything that happened, but it’s time to move on.”

But if she doesn’t, those words can be fore me.",2

Okay, storytime.

On Friday, October 29th of this year, my parents flew out to Houston, TX. The company that my Mom and I work for had asked my Dad to make/deliver/and install a bunch of cabinetry/fixtures for the new surgical center being constructed in Houston.

My parents had to drop by our apartment early the morning they left so my brother could give them a ride to the airport. My mom actually came inside, woke me up, and said goodbye (hugs and all that good stuff). Dad didn’t, and at the time, I didn’t care because I was so freaking tired.

Needless to say, I wish I would have.

At the time, I was certain he would be alright…he always is. But then again…life is uncertain.

Fast forward to Monday morning… Parents were still in Texas. I was getting ready for my 9:55 a.m. class. On the way to my car, I started thinking about my folks. I thought about how I hadn’t really spoken to them over the weekend at all. I thought about how I had not actually spoken to my dad since the previous Thursday. When I got in my car, the cd I had in the drive began playing. It was the song “Proud” by good friends of mine, The Icarus Account. It’s one of very few songs that remind me of my dad.

As I was driving, I started to think about another thing. When I was in 4th or 5th grade (1998?), my grandfather (my dad’s dad) had passed away in Texas, somewhere around Dallas. He went into cardiac arrest at a Home Depot while shopping for rugs for he and his wife’s new home in Dallas. It was incredibly hard for my family, and to this day, I can barely tell my stories of him. A picture hangs in my room, right next my desk, of my grandpa, my brother, and I, sitting in a little fishing boat at his old cabin. It’s probably my favorite picture. It was also one of the last times we saw him, so, I love it. Haha.

Now, upon thinking about this, I thought to myself, “I wonder if it’s weird for my dad to go to Texas? I wonder if he’s okay? What if something happened?” and so on. So, I decided to call him. The phone went straight to voicemail. Strange.

So, I called my mom. She answered almost instantly…

>“Ricky,” my mom said.

>“Yeah?” I asked.

>“Where are you?”

>“Heading to school, why?”

>“Are you on campus or in your car?”

>“Car.”

>“Ricky, I have to tell you something.”

>“What?”

>“It’s your dad. He had a heart attack last night”

I turned the car around, and headed home.

Backtrack to late Sunday night… It was Halloween night, and the delivery truck had just arrived at the surgical center. My mom and dad arrived, and began unloading the truck. They weren’t alone, thankfully; the driver of the truck and a woman who happened to be working late that night were there to help.

At around 11 p.m., while still in the process of unloading some cabinetry, my mom noticed something was wrong. My dad was sweating. Heavily. He had been complaining that he was extremely hot, and actually removed his shirt to try and alleviate some of the heat. It didn’t help. So, being the tough guy my dad is, he decided to go on a little walking cool-off session down one of the building’s hallways by himself. My mom, being the protector that she is, noticed he had left the area, so she gave him a call.

>“Rick, where are you?” 
My dad responded somewhere along the lines of, >“Honey…I think I’m in a bit of trouble here.”

My mom hung up, sprinted inside, and found my dad standing in the hallway, fairly unresponsive. She rushed him outside, and they placed my dad in the backseat of a car to cool him off. 911 was called, and paramedics were on the scene within 2 minutes. Crazy fast, thank god.

The last thing my dad remembers is answering a few basic questions for the paramedics.

Suddenly, without warning, he took a gasp of air, eyes rolled to the back of his head, and he fell backwards. He had gone into cardiac arrest. The paramedics picked him up and threw him onto the stretcher in the ambulance. The truck driver and the woman pulled my mom away from the ambulance to a nearby curb. They prayed and prayed and prayed as the paramedics attempted to bring my dad back to life in the back of an ambulance.

The details of the story, though important, are a bit graphic, so I won’t get into them. Simply put, throughout the course of the next couple of hours, my dad flatlined five separate times. My dad died and came back FIVE SEPARATE TIMES. He was defibrillated five separate times as well, and at least once in front of my mom. He had a 100% blockage in the artery where a previous stent was placed about five years earlier. An angioplasty was performed that night, another stent was placed, and the artery was again opened up. By some strange fortune, one of the best heart surgeons in the Houston area was on call that night, working on my father. Thank goodness. He was out of surgery in just over an hour.

It was an absolute miracle. Had this happened anywhere else, had this happened at home, had the ambulance not arrived in two minutes (the type of heart attack he suffered gives a five minute response window of survival), he would’ve been gone. Had my mom not traveled with him to Houston (she didn’t have to), he would have been gone. Had the people who were there late that night not been there, he would have been gone. Had the right paramedics, nurses, cardiologists, and surgeons not been there, he would have been gone.

He recovered quickly, and they flew back home on Wednesday night. Normally, this type of situation requires a longer recovery period, but he’s a tough dude. So my dad, my mom, and grandma (she flew down upon hearing the news) headed home.

That night, my bro and I were on our way to pick them up from the airport. It was then that everything hit me. Hard. Rob and I almost lost our dad. I almost didn’t get to say goodbye. Our grandma almost lost her son. Our mom almost lost her best friend. Life, as we know it, was almost flipped completely upside down. But here, out of fate and fortune, was a second chance for our entire family.

As we pulled up to the brightly lit terminal, we saw him standing there with our mom, our grandma, and our aunt (his sister, there to pick up grandma). As soon as we were stopped, I opened the door, and headed straight for him.

I swear to each and every one of you, I have never cried so hard in my life. I have never hugged somebody so hard in my life. Never, in my entire life, had I felt such a rush of emotion as I did that night. Such relief, such happiness, such joy in being able to hold onto someone who was almost ripped away from this world, five states from home, five states from his family. I can’t even begin to explain the feeling. It was sad. It was happy. It was absolutely beautiful.

>“Good to see ya, kid,” he said, crying.
>“You too, dad.”

Everyone hugged everyone, and there was this giant family hug. Just tons pf happiness and relief all over the place. We were a family, reunited in near tragedy. It felt good.

>“Your dad’s always had a knack for getting us together in the strangest ways,” my grandma said.  Everyone laughed. Just so happy.

We said our goodbyes to our grandma and aunt, and hopped in the truck.

As we pulled away onto the airport roundabout, the radio was turned up quietly. We sat silently, and I listened. A certain, special song came on, and I was absolutely certain it was meant to be. “I Will Follow You Into the Dark” by Death Cab for Cutie faded in softly, just beginning as we rolled down the highway. I was the only one who noticed. For those of you who aren’t aware of the song, it speaks about death and having optimism in losing someone you love. It’s about a comfort that one day, the people you love are going to die. But, in knowing this, there is comfort. The opening verse says...

>""Love of mine, someday you will die. But I'll be close behind, and follow you into the dark. No blinding light, or tunnels to gates of white. Just our hands clasped so tight. Waiting for the hint of a spark.""

I love this song, and when it came on at that moment, I couldn’t help but tear up. It was perfect. I reached up to the front seat, holding my dad’s hand for the first time since I was a little kid. I never wanted to let it go.

I sit here at my desk, in the after hours of Friday’s workday, stuck waiting for the plows to clear the roads on a snowy December night, writing this story. There are tears on my hands. There are tears on my keyboard. This is my favorite story. This will always be my favorite story. I will tell this to everyone I know and love until the day I die. As they say, where there is darkness, there is light. I have never understood and appreciated this sentiment in a deeper fashion. Real happiness.

TL;DR - I was going to ask for advice about something in my life, and that turned into a good friend and redditor telling me just to tell my story.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of bad at writing, but I tried it anyway.  Care to listen to my boring story friends?

Wall of text Inc.


First, my parents split.  Boohoo, I know.  The real problem came from my mother trying to turn me against my father for four years(14-18).  And, sure, my dad was a prick in the beginning of it all but by no means deserved what she was trying to serve.  Upon reaching 18, a huge fight happened, spent some time at my father's and was enlightened on what really happened.  Long story short, my mother asked for an open relationship and had her fun.  Then when my father asked for his she lost her shit and made it seem like he was the adulterous one.   Couple that with having dated a girl for three years in highschool who cheated on me multiple times, and I stuck with her.  First love, I was a neckbeard basement troll who didnt think he could do better, etc.  Started going to community college after high school, then did the same excuse 'oh I want to take some time off and work to make some cash.'  Never ended up going back with maybe about a semesters worth left for an associates.  I spent my time between working and taking care of my injured/minorly crippled mother(Back and leg injury from a work related accident).  All I really had was my best friend(Henceforth known as D) whom I'd met over pokemon when I was 11, and that was all I really needed.

Now flash forward through about two years of some community college, a lot of working, drinking, partying, fapping, porn, WoW, and general slacking off.  Somewhere in this timeframe I opened up a bit, learned how to socialize and honed my silver tongue.  Sell dirt to a farmer, convince a prostitute for a free sample--all that jazz. I'd been working as a line cook at Ruby Tuesdays, living at home helping my mother.  I'd toned up a bit from being an amorphous blob but I was still a bigger guy(6'3, around 300 lbs).  Another close friend of mine, J, would come into play, but our dynamic was different.  J was a little shy, and fairly quirky.  Socially awkward maybe?  He had moved in with me and my mother because, well, we didn't mind the extra relief on the bills and he loved my family as his own.  I helped open him up, and helped him learn how to deal with a turbocunt of a girlfriend who would later drive a wedge between us(but more on that later).  J was a damn good friend, always had my back, always tried to cheer me up.  But I wasn't able to open up to him.  So I just sequestered myself off in my room.  I played WoW, or other videogames, and would really only socialize when we'd have some silly idea to throw some kind of themed party and invite our friends.  Then I met Tiny Dancer(TD).  This girl was beautiful in every way.  Small in frame, did ballet for 16 years, porcelain skin.  Just amazing.  Who proceeded to lead me on while pursuing D's D.  Sometime of that she decided to choose me.  At first it was purely sexual.  She wanted her relief and I wanted the attention.  Like that stupid Offspring song.  Then it progressed into something more, something far more fucked up.  Mommy dearest didn't approve of me, and because I was not ""classically handsome,"" she was embarassed of me.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] didn't even hold my hand in public places if we could be seen.  But still I poured my energy into it.  Eventually I learned my lesson, and she ran off to some other guy(and contracted VD, dodged that bullet eh?).  I felt like shit.  I went back to drinking a lot.  But this time, I did it with a new perspective--Fuck what anyone else thought.  Law of averages, being a manwhore, whatever.  I chased tail and the bottoms of bottles.  
Shortly after this, D left for the airforce(I'm [REDACTED_NAME] 21 now).  The one person I was open with and close to left.  I didn't fault him for it, he found his path and followed it and to this day I could not be happier for him.  But it left me in a rut, a lonely rut soon after I found some sort of contentment.  A new door opened for me though. I'd taken a really well paying and promising position at a graveyard as a groundskeeper.  It was an interesting job, and if anyone cares to ask about it at some point feel free.  I've got stories.  I've seen some shit.  Something about being outside, working with my hands, and providing a service and just being able to help and assure people that their loved ones may have been lost--They would be cared for and not forgotten.  It gave me some sense of purpose, but also destroyed any minor shred of religion or faith that may have been left in my(I was never really religious but was raised Catholic in a large Irish family).  But again, I fell into a monotony of Work, WoW, and weekend boozing.  The only difference is, I had a lot more disposable income.  That's when Lily entered the picture.  Or server in this case.  She was 35 at the time.  And a world of warcraft relationship.  Skype calls, phone calls, login and insta-party together.  But it was a terrible thing.  It was almost the opposite of my previous relationship.  She wanted attention, she craved it.  Negative, positive, any.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you all know the type.  The one who had several wow guys at her beck and call, but I said 'hey fuck it.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] top of the list, she loves me, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with that.""  Then she just ran me through hell and back, some how managed a visit in there when things got wretched and I just went back into ""doesn't matter had sex,"" mode.  Then it all sunk right back down the drain hole right after she left.  I don't even remember the reason why we stopped, but we did.  It was ugly, it was vicious, and it left me without the urge to play WoW anymore.  I stepped away and just became a hermit.  If I wasn't working, I was reading.  This would be one of the few times I didn't turn to alcohol.  
I turned to craigslist.  Just decided to start going after whatever moved.  Pretty, not pretty. Skinny, fat, troll, bloodelf.  Whatever.  If she gave me the time of day, I gave it to her.  After a several months of this Cal found me.  She responded to an ad of mine and we hit it off.  It started off completely different than any other of my indiscretions, so to me it was amazing.  She had just left a horrible relationship, and I was still seething over mine.  I was probably about 22 at this time, and had left the graveyard.  I went back to cooking at a local all hours diner and was made the Graveyard shift kitchen manager.  Which, seemed to work out well for both of us and spending time together because she worked from home and seemed to be a night owl much like myself.  A good amount of time was spent together, I remember a lot of it in detail.  It was just before my birthday.  It was fall, and every morning I'd get off I would go by her place with a pumpkin spice latte and a bagel for her.  We'd sit and talk and cuddle and watch cheap horror movies on netflix til she fell asleep then I'd head home.  Not long after that she started staying over at my place, and then next thing I knew she had pretty much moved in.  Right after I realized what had happened a huge fight ensued between her and her old roommates to pretty much cement her place in my house.  But I was ok with it.  Sure it was moving fast but this girl was amazing.  To keep the pace, 'I love you' started getting thrown around like it how glitter and rainbows do in equestria.  
This is where shit starts to get real stupid.
Then out of some misguided attempt to white picket fence everything I proposed.  No ring, just a ""hey, wanna get married?""  She said yes, we told my mother, called her mother, and then went back to playing videogames.  Now, as this happened my friend J's and my relationship started getting stressed.  Mainly because our psychohose beasts.  They pretty much had us wrapped around their fingers and if they had told us to tear each other's throat out we probably would have.  As a newly engaged couple ""we"" decided me not taking care of my mother anymore(and in all honesty she was to a point where she didn't need it) was the best choice and to get a place together.  J decided he no longer wanted to live there if I wasn't going to be there even given our animosity, and that left my mother deciding to move in with my grandparents who she was taking care of day to day.  So, come december of 09, I'd moved into a quaint(read as: shit hole) duplex down by the ocean front.  Complete with baseboard heating(that didn't work), window unit AC(that didn't work), and the most retarded plumbing system(to change the pace--didn't work) ever.  
We started planning our wedding.  We didn't want anything big, just some family and a small ceremony with an offciant.  She got her dress, I finally got her a nice ring set.  We were happy.  For about a month.  Going into the moving in together there was some stress.  Mainly because I lied to her about one major thing.  She told me she wanted me to no longer speak to Lily, or have any association with her.  I had stated playing WoW again, and instead of listening--I stayed friends.  Nothing more ever happened, and it was mostly civil.  I think the big issue was that I lied.  Which then moved into the issue of my sexual appetite before I met her.  It was few and far between that she'd meet a female friend, or I would be noticed in public without us walking away and her accusing me of having slept with them before.  I couldn't fathom why it mattered because I was sleeping with her now, not them.  She's the only one I wanted to sleep with.
Then small fights started to happen.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if I've stated but she worked from home.  She wrote web content.  Claimed she made a lot of money doing so.  And I'm [REDACTED_NAME] she could have if the company she worked for wasn't bullshit in how their system worked.  I was working 40-55 hours a week cooking at a local diner.  But she, well she seemed to be working all the time.  Constantly stressed.  So I helped out around the house. Cleaned, cooked, etc.  But that became a problem.  Because I didn't clean 'her' way, and whenver I cooked she would just ignore it and end up making microwavable pizza or something.  So, I generally stopped caring and spent my time doing other things like playing WoW or dicking around with photography.   When this happened she decided we needed to spend more time together even though if I wasn't working I was around her always.  She didn't like to go out, she didn't like people.  So spending time together was just sitting and watching tv series on netflix. It was either done in complete silence/her falling asleep OR a huge argument.  They all eventually lead to arguments because I would suggest ""hey, you took a break from work but you should probably get back to it don't you think,"" and I would be accused of wanting to play Wow or be away from her, as opposed to just being resonsible.  

Now mind you, this is only about 6 months into the relationship and about 3 months into living together(2 alone).  Around this time it was Tax season.  Hers were complicated because she basically had her own business/contractor for the company she worked for and she told me to just do my own cause hers would take some time.  Thats when I let her know I didn't know how.  She was fucking flabbergasted.  After a minor heated debate and a long discussion, I learned something.  Most the things about adult life, and livin alone, I had no clue about.  You know, the things your parents should have taught you?  I had come to realize why I had such an easy ride, and learned why my mother was so upset with me moving out(even though i was barely ten minutes away).  It's because she didn't want me to.  She had intentionally sabotaged my ability to progress to living on my own.  Now, I can understand where some of this is my fault--If I wanted to know/learn I could or would have.  And I agree.  But after having confronted my mother and her agreeing that she essentially kept me in the dark about certain things, and urged me to make stupid decisions(buying a vehicle with a high payment so all my money would go towards it and living at home was a smarter choice), I still feel as though i'm [REDACTED_NAME] wholly responsible and have some resent me towards her.

So over the next few months things continued on the same in that regard.  We had one major  fight where she went through my email to find something and found a spam email from ashley maddison or some shit and snapped.  I had to leave from work and it was a lot of drama before she would even concede it could have been spam(again all of this based on my past, before her).  But so in April, we got married.  The 19th.  Small little ceremony in a public park with an officiant and some family.  That was that.  

Same problems continued, but now we're gonna throw money into the mix.  My bills, our bills, and her work just weren't adding up.  She was ""handling"" the money and bills but more often than not I would have to do some side work or ask my parents to loan me money.  She started sleeping on a different schedule than me(I was still working 3rd shift at this diner), so I maybe saw her for 15 minutes to an hour every day before I would leave for work and end up being asleep.  And god forbid if i woke her to ask for anything I didn't have access to(account numbers, etc) because I was 'stressing' and 'making mountains out of mole hills.'  The one major fight that started was because she claimed to have paid the water bill and it was three months behind, water cut off, and If I didn't have the money in to them(or proof we paid) our water was going to be off for the weekend.  Spoiler Alert: It was off for the weekend.  Ever had to shit in a bucket not being in the woods?  I have.  It's still pretty fun.
Now, with all of this stress sex became an issue.  She was harder to please and my drive just went down.  Then she'd get pissed because I didnt want it, or accuse me of not being at work and cheating on her, which in turn made me want it less.  Which just magnified everything else.  I mean hell, she almost walked out on me over a polite discussion on politics.  She knew well I was apathetic about most issues and brought it up one night saying ""I don't think I can be with someone who doesn't care,"" and started packing.  
Through all of this, keeping with WoW, to alleviate things on the Lily front I blocked her from every aspect of my life.  Server switch, name change, blocked her on social media, had her number blocked in my phone.  I had made some new friends.  One who stood out the most.  His name was Loot. We became pretty close friends--We were peas of a pod.  We both enjoyed good drink, good games, and had a penchant for being gruff no-nonsense characters.  We started running a late night raid group in our guild and quickly became officers and the premier group that was leading firsts in our guild.  This obviously led to a lot of time talking and hanging out virtually, whic then led to personal lives and noticing when one person was having a bad day over others etc.  We connected, he was there for me, he gave me a lot of advice regarding the wife/Cal.  He told me through his experiences the relationship was toxic and it was just poisoning me and I needed to get out.  The next time she threatened to leave I needed to let her, or do it on my own.  I really should have listened.  I think part of the reason I stay in touch with him and we're such close friends is at the end of the day, he's never once rubbed it in my face or played the 'i told you so card.'  He simply gave me advice and left it up to me to follow it.  Without his support I don't know where I would have been, but he helped me through--especially the next part.

After a visit to michigan to see Cal's family, ""we"" decided the best choice was for us to move to michigan.  500 dollar rent? Get a job in the nursing field, we'd be set.  We started to put these plans into motion with hopes of moving by September.  So fast forward to the end of August, with some renewed vigor and hope, and still some fighting, but things had progressed a bit for the better.  I came home one morning from work and was packing up the last few things we had left aside from our computers.  Had sold off a lot of extra belongings(Tv, consoles, furniture, etc).  It was two days before my last day at my job and about eight days before the move.  I was getting everything set up, and trying to make some breakfast and coffee in the kitchen.  She walked in, wrapped her arms around me and got on her toes leaning up to kiss my cheek and said:

""I think we should get a seperation.""

Story isn't finished, but after such a long wall of text I just want to know if people are interested to hear the rest.  I know I didn't go into a lot of detail about certain things so if anyone wants clarifications, just ask.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to head into work here soon but I'll check up on it sometime this evening.

b192et,1552615392.0,2019-03-15 02:03:12,self,"I stood up for an elderly woman at Dollar Tree, and then cried my eyes out.","Something just happened that I’ve been told is important to share.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] in any way looking for a pat on the back, I have just realized in recent months that talking about this stuff and exposing injustice no matter how small are steps towards a better world.  I used to think this was baloney, and that one person can’t make a difference, but hey, let’s all try together.

Here’s what happened:

I was just at the Dollar Tree, very close to a few senior communities.  I was just going in for a few pieces of glassware to hold makeup brushes on my vanity but turned into something more that had me break down in tears once I was back in my car trying to reach my boyfriend on the phone.

I’ll try not to make this too long but this is about my experience standing up for an elderly woman.  While something like talking to strangers in public, especially alone, is way out of my comfort zone, the loud conversation I overheard prompted me to take a stand.

While I was browsing the front section upon entering the store I overheard a loud male voice say “Do you not seize opportunities when they come to you!?”...I continued to listen, “I might not see you ever again, or maybe I will, just take my number” (she interjected with a meek “No thank you”).  He went on, “maybe tomorrow--maybe a year from now you’ll call.  Look, I think you are attractive and intelligent…”  I moved towards the voice and found this elderly man (maybe mid-late 70’s) talking at this elderly woman about the same age, both of them seemed to be in good health and more than decent shape.

Their conversation/him talking at her continued for several minutes loudly enough for most of the store to hear.  There were only about three or four other shoppers in view and one cashier at the front.  I then purposely got in this man’s eye-line and made brief eye contact so he would know I was there listening.  He asked her again even louder making pointed hand gestures “Do you not seize opportunities?!” she said timidly, “Well...apparently not.”  And yet, he continued to beg and frame her as foolish for passing on the chance to take his phone number.

I just thought to myself “I have to do something...I have to say something”....I’m tearing up as I type this because I can’t help but feel I should have done more.  I can’t remember every piece of dialogue because it all went so fast but here’s what happened:

I walk right up to the woman’s side, almost between them, I look up at the man (he was about 6ft+) and say with a stern voice matching his volume (hoping others in store can hear) “Pardon me, I don’t mean to be rude or interrupt” then make eye contact with the woman and ask “M’am did you already tell this man ‘No’?”

Woman: *nods her head yes* and says “Yyes” with a stutter.

The man seemed flabbergasted and I could see him getting visibly upset.  He said, still loud, “Excuse Me”

I repeated, “Like I said, I don’t want to interrupt but this woman has already said no to you, she doesn’t want to talk to you so you should stop.”   (My heart was beating so fast and my voice was shakey and I couldn’t exactly think of the right words to say).

Man:  “Oh alright, yeah, I understand! You and your feminism!”

I turned to the woman again, she gently grabbed and held up my hand in both of hers and looked into my eyes with a strange combination of appreciation and fear.

I ask, “M’am do you want to continue to talk with this man?”
(I think he was continuing to say things to me but I was solely focused on this lady).

She shyly said, “It’s okay, I can….still listen.”  and tapped my hand and thanked me.

I said “Oh okay” and turned to the man and said “I just wanted to make it clear.   She already said no.”  and I walked away respecting the woman’s wish to stay by him and knowing she wasn’t in any physical danger.

Once I was out of sight, he continued to speak to her and shouted this part.  “Certain people choose to eavesdrop on certain things!”  I was in the immediate next aisle and shouted back “The whole store can hear you sir!”  and he said “WELL GOOD!”

My blood was boiling but I had to calm my breathing….I considered dropping my things and leaving immediately.  But I wanted to make sure he didn’t keep following her.

I went about my business and the store was silent.  I saw that he was now in the back of the store and I watched the elderly woman leave with no shopping bags and boarded the little shuttle waiting outside.

I collected the rest of my items and saw the man was now browsing the very back of the store.  I was, of course, still upset.  While he was still in my field of view, and knowing the lady had left, I wanted to go up to him again and say “By the way, it’s not called being a feminist, it’s called being a decent human being!”-----But I didn’t.  He already acted like he was being attacked in that earlier encounter, at this point he’d take anything I say as a threat.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] angry that he made it seem like I was the one with the problem...and that somehow him speaking to this lady in what, in his time, was a “gentlemanly fashion” made the situation okay.  He looked at and spoke to me like I was attacking HIM as he publicly shouted at me for being a feminist in such a negative/accusatory tone…like I’M some liberal whack job and he’s the victim...

Anyway, so that’s it.  Bought my stuff...went to my car...and cried on the phone.  (Spoiler, I’m still crying.)

Here’s why.  It hit me all at once.  The look of fear in that lady’s eyes...imagining the countless women throughout our present and past mistreated by men or made to feel like they are the ones with the problem.  This is real life.  Real everyday women have been dealing with this garbage for so long.  Not just in the movies...it didn’t just “happen a long time ago” it was, and it is real.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you listening...reading?  I have some other thoughts...this next part is just for me to get out (as if I hadn’t said enough).

Funny (well not funny but)...Coincidentally, I had recently been talking to my boyfriend and some other friends about that fact that I’ve decided that maybe I should be more open about my personal struggles with sexual harassment and assault.  I’ve always thought that the world doesn’t need a #metoo story from ME because my assaulter has already been criminally charged, put on the registry, and is out of my life.  BUT I’m going to now semi-publicly share my story.  If you want details you can ask me directly.  I was sexually assaulted when I was 8.  (Aw man see now I’m crying again.)  If you don’t know, I went through a really rough 8-year custody battle following my parents’ divorce in a 90’s family court that systematically favored mothers over fathers.  It took me getting assaulted by my stepfather for my dad to get the full custody of me that he should have already had.  My biological mother is a diagnosed psychopath with personality disorders, it took this for the court to let me live with my dad.

Here’s my story:
My mom and I run errands and stop by the church up the street from where we were staying at the time (we bounced around a lot, she had a lot of fake addresses).  ANYWAY, while sitting in the pews in an empty church she said she noticed that I was starting to warm up to her new husband.  (Like most kids, I hated anyone that my single parents dated because I wanted my own parents to live happily ever after but after their wedding I started to be nice to him to make my mom happy.)  So she said she noticed us getting closer and then told me she wanted me to stop accepting shoulder rides from him---stop holding his hand---stop sitting next to him---don’t let him run his fingers through my hair.  I was EIGHT.  I was like...ok!....

We leave the church, and a few hours later she drops me off back “home” while she goes back to church for some kind of bible study group.  ALONE….with him.  Our room was a re-purposed pantry somewhere in some old lady’s house.  I felt super awkward staying there so I never left this very narrow room.  There was a long dresser, one bed, and a little tv stand with a microwave on it (that’s unsafe lol).  There was nowhere else to sit so I sat on the bed and put on a vhs movie, I don’t remember which.  My stepdad climbed on the bed with me and I thought nothing of it as I watched the tv.  He began massaging my legs, I was wearing stretchy pants like little girls do.  He worked his way up and I was like… “What are you doing?”  he said “It’s okay” with a reassuring smile as he worked his way up then said “You’re going to like it” and he pulled back the waistband of my pants & underwear.  (I’m 8, I didn’t know what sex was, I didn’t know that it’s not called a “Pah-china”).  Anyways, he put his fingers on my crotch and I got goosebumps and didn’t know why but I somehow knew something was wrong so I jumped off the bed and yelled “NO” and ran.

I ran out to the backyard and don’t remember where I ended up and I remember my mom coming home quickly after.  I didn’t tell her.  It was all so strange to me and I was a quiet kid (shocking right?).  Luckily my it was my dad’s time to pick me up like 15min later.  I said nothing in the car ride to my dad’s house.  On our way into the house, I said “Something...happened.”  My dad was my best friend and I am [REDACTED_NAME] glad that he always listened to me and valued what I had to say no matter how young I was.

Anyways (for like the tenth time), that was my first sexual experience.  I won’t go on to do anymore preaching.  I’ll just close by saying this--let’s all make an effort to not only listen more but to stand up for each other.

813tl4,1519893182.0,2018-03-01 08:33:02,self,It feels good finally talking about this stuff,"This would be my second post ever on reddit. It felt really good typing my thoughts, experiences and insecurities on here the first time. Now ever since I popped my cherry on reddit, I want to post more of them. So I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to tell you my story.

So this all happened when I popped out of my moms vagina. I was the second born and my brother was 4 years older than me. I wanted to be like my older brother through out my life. He was always the cooler order brother that I looked up to. But he thought i was this annoying younger brother and was ashamed to have me as a younger brother. My parents were immigrants to canada that came from what some might say as a 3rd world country.  Me and my brother were first generation canadians. 

Some of the earliest memories I have is of my father beating up my mother or being drunk.  I was always really close with my mom and seeing her get beat countless time and not being able to do anything, probably really fucked me up as a kid.  I still remember not knowing what's going on and why my dad was beating my mom and why she was crying. I was very young at this time when this was going on. I don't really remember much about my childhood and it's probably due to the fact my subconscious blocked out all that shit. 

So around the time I was 5 or 6ish(I don't really remember the exact age) my dad had died. I remember my family(cousins aunts, uncles) crying. But I don't remember feeling anything. I don't think I fully understand what was going on. I time to time would ask my mom questions about my dad but she really didn't want to talk about it and would ignore me and not properly talk to me.

Me, my brother, and my mom had moved in with my uncle and his family. I remember having to sleep in the same bed as my mom because there wasn't enough beds and rooms for all of us. So I got to be really close with my mom. I know it must of been really hard for my mom, being an young Immigrant girl that doesn't even speak English and now her husband died and left her with 2 kids. Me and my brother were not easy kids to raise. I couldn't imagine the stress and pressure she was under. And I used to be wild kid that was always getting into trouble or pushing limits. A real brat. But looking back on it now, I know I did all those things just to get attention. So I would do something bad and get beat by my mom, uncles, grandpa, aunt. I really used to get beat quite a lot. I wasn't getting knocked around or anything but I would get a slap or a bunch of slaps on my face when I did something wrong. But honestly I don't blame them for that shit, I don't know how I would have handled my younger self. 

I started going to school and I noticed I was really different from the other kids.  I had this shame about not having a dad. I hated school and could never focus in it.  So I would always talk when teacher is talking and never payed attention. I was always getting in trouble. The Majority of my teacher thought I ADD or a learning disability. I remember having to do a bunch of weird tests to check for it. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] not sure if I do or don't have it. My mom would always complain about me and call me stupid to other family members. She would always complain about me and my brother, say we are dumb and other kids were better than us. She would always compare other people kids to me and my brother. She really made me feel dumb. I had this stuttering problem and talked way too fast, so a lot of people couldn't really understand me. They would make fun of me and this made me more self conscious. I was a loner and was considered the black sheep of the family. I didn't really get along with my older brother, cousins and men in general. I felt more comfortable with girls and women. This was probably due to the fact I barely remember my dad and mostly grew up around women. I was considered the black sheep of the family. I was constantly getting ignored and laughed by my family. So I just started watching a lot of TV and playing allot of video games. This was probably my escape.

My mom remarried around when I was in grade 3. He was from overseas and was a really kind man. I always considered him as my real dad and completely forgot about my biological dad. I opened up to him and he accepted me and my brother. He never hit me or my mom, he didn't get drunk. He was calm and didn't get upset that much unlike my mom. She was always yelling and bitching at me. My step dad didn't like when me and my brother would go my cousins house (biological fathers side of family). Being young and not understanding why he was doing that, made me angry. He would always get upset when we went and make us feel like shit that we went.  So overtime I started convincing myself that my step dad was my actual dad.I started talking less to my biological dads side of the family. The Kids in school would ask why did my last name change. I never knew what to tell them. I felt ashamed to tell them what really happened. So I would just ignore it or lie and make up a story. My step dad became a trucker so he was mostly on the road and my mom once again was alone in raising two kids. I became a loner and mostly kept to myself.

I never had a gf in high school but I had a couple girls that liked me but I never ended dating any of them. I think I was ashamed that they might find out who I really was. I never did any drugs but i used to drink alcohol with friends. But my brother was a druggy and alcoholic at this time. I remember countless times when I had help my brother up the stairs to his room when  he would come home drunk. I would check on him all night and help him to bathroom when he wanted to go. He was probably just battling his own demons. 

I started dating this girl after high school. She was friend from high school. She wasn't really that attractive or a good person. I often had other girls and guys saying why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] her or ask what i see in her.  I actually I was ashamed she was my gf, so for the first year of our relationship I didn't tell anyone, not even my close friends. But everyone eventually found out. I didn't like her cause of her looks but I liked her because we got along well together. I clearly had mommie issues and picked an ugly girl because she wouldn't leave me. I wanted to please her and be nice to her so she wouldn't leave. This was probably because I could never get the approval from my mom so I tried to get it from my gf. I told her everything about myself but only years after we met. We were together for 4 years. I had never talked about my family to anyone before her. She worked at the same place as my older bother and she told me a story one day that she heard someone tell about my brother. They said my brother's dad had committed suicide. When my gf told me this story it was the first time I realized that my biological father committed suicide. For some reason after that day everything started making sense and I realized why no one really answered my questions about my dad when I was younger. I guess my subconscious just blocked that part out. I think it was due to the trauma having to grow up in that situation. I realize now that my biological father was  probably depressed and had a mental illness. Im scared because I think might have the same illness.  I still have this shame,  i am [REDACTED_NAME], and I have no one to talk to about this stuff. I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I thought of committing suicide before but the only reason I don't is because I wouldn't want to put my mom through that again. I know I need to go to psychologist but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and can't afford it. I have a lot of debt and work at a dead end job.

When I was in college and about to grad from a marketing diploma program, my mom got breast cancer. This was a really hard time for my family. I remember all the surgeries my mom got and she ended getting her breast removed. I was with her for all of her chemo treatments. Sometimes her chemo treatments would last 5 hours. She didn't speak English that well so I would translate what the doctors has said to her. At this time I broke up with my gf. The same one from before. I was in a really fucked up place in this moment of my life but I couldn't admit it to myself. I didn't even tell my friends about my mom going through chemo. I would act like everythings fine but I was hurting on the inside. After I broke up with gf I had no one to talk to. I was raised to show no emotion or not to cry and act as if everything was fine. I never wanted anyone to pity me or find out anything about my family. Luckily the 2 rounds of chemo therapy helped and my mom is still with me to this day. 

To end on a positive note, I started smoking weed and I started reflecting on this kind of stuff. I don't think I would be posting on here or even be thinking about this stuff, if it wasn't for weed. Weed had helped me in many ways. I started reading up on things for self improvement. I learned a lot about myself. I am [REDACTED_NAME] I am [REDACTED_NAME] of past experiences. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to get help and fix myself. I will not end up like my dead beat biological dad.",5
4sucom,1468516036.0,2016-07-14 17:07:16,self,It's been a long 10 years for me... (long post),"I am 22 years old and here's my story. It all started 10 years ago in the summer of 2006 when I was 12. Around this time, my mom accused my dad of cheating on her with this woman who worked at an office in a synagogue that we had been members of. My dad was the treasurer of the synagogue, so he spent a good amount of time there and became friendly with the people there. My mom is a school teacher, naturally she gets summers off and was looking to spend more time with my dad. Thats fine and all, but he works a full time job, works a little real estate, etc... 

Anyway, summer of 2006 became one the worst summers of my life. I was absolutely infatuated by my parents. I loved them together and they were basically my superheroes, my best friends. They would constantly fight, not even normal marriage fighting, but screaming and hollering and this would scare the shit out of me. I was 12 years old and this was possibly the demise of my parents marriage. I would be so upset everyday fearing the worst. They ended up staying together, but my mom had insane trust issues with my dad. 

Following the summer of hell, my two brothers were in college and my sister lived elsewhere so I was alone with them. Nonetheless, my family is/was very close. We keep in touch daily and we go on vacations often. Everyday was a constant challenge because there would be so much tension, and it would only get worse from there. 

Fast forward past more fighting and me constantly being upset and anxious about divorce to high school. Summer of 2008, my mom was diagnosed with a couple of debilitating diseases and this changed everything. At this point, my childhood barely mattered. Since my dad was working a full day and had meetings and other things to attend to, as well as my siblings doing there own thing, I was left to basically be the caretaker to my mom. 

My mom continued to work as a school teacher, but the two diseases would change her completely from a happy person who was amazing to be around to somebody I would just feel numb towards. She wasn't the bad guy, nor will I ever see her as that. However, I don't feel I can retrieve our relationship that we had prior to this. She loves me way more than I love her and it sucks because I wish I would be able to reciprocate.

My siblings over the years would help from time to time and say things to melike, ""I am [REDACTED_NAME] you have to deal with the two of them and their fighting."" Or something like, ""I am [REDACTED_NAME] we haven't been around as much."" This is the best one, ""Sorry you are the one that has to take care of mom."" At first, I was bitter and upset that they weren't around, but then it took me a while to realize that its okay. It is beyond anyone's control, life happens. 

During my high school years, I lacked any motivation to do well, I would get low B's C's and basically just get by in my studies. My parents weren't really around to help me or motivate me. The only motivation they actually tried was threatening about going to the local community college. This initially scared me because I thought at that point, it would be over for me. 

This did not sink in until my junior year when it was a little too late. I bombed my SATs and I knew my parents were disappointed. It was memorial day weekend of 2011 that my life would basically change. I was all out of options until one of my friends brought up they were going to the local community college their senior year of of high school for an early admit program. At that moment, I thought that this was an opportunity to grasp and a brand new start. 

I was accepted into the program and thats where I started to flourish. I became more independent and doing much better than I did in high school. Stayed there for two years. Through the duration of the two years I was there, I had 3 jobs/internships to keep me busy.

It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows though, for things would just get bad. My mom and dad continually fought and finally my dad just left. This ruined me. I will never forget what I said to my mom when she told me that he left. I screamed at her. I said, ""WHAT DID YOU DO?"" Honestly, I felt terrible for her and I felt like an asshole for blaming her. I rushed out of my house and drove to my best friends house and ran into my best friend and is mom and gave them giant hugs while crying hysterically. 

One to two weeks later, my dad came back. But this wouldn't be the first time he would leave. Anyway, Memorial day weekend of 2013 would come. Remember what happened two years earlier? Well, Memorial day weekend of 2013 was 100x better. I was at work the thursday or friday before we went on vacation, and I was checking my email and I received an acceptance email from The George Washington University. I had no idea how to react, I was ecstatic! While away, thats all my parents, my brother and I would be talking about. This was a huge win for me. I never thought I would have been accepted to a school like that. 

My first year of actual college starts and I am a transfer. It was a great place to be and I instantly fell in love with the school. However, they put the transfers basically in no where near the middle of campus. They put us in singles in a dorm that was connected to a 7/11. This was a decent/poor year for me. November of my sophomore year, I became ""addicted"" to pot and would smoke constantly. I got fat and I would not even try. Prior to that, I tried joining fraternity as a legacy but I hated it. 

I hated the fraternity because I thought it would be an easy process, but boy was I wrong. I would get hazed by people my own age and I blamed my anxiety on leaving. I was weak and I couldn't do it. I wish I had the balls to have gone through with it and made lifelong friends, but I sabotaged that opportunity. Later, the fraternity was disbanded and many of the brothers blamed me, but I never told administration about any of the hazing. 

Later that year, I was in danger of failing more than one class, my then girlfriend broke up with me because I barely gave a shit about the relationship, many people hated me for something I didn't do. I was in a deep depression, so I skipped class one day and went to the counseling center because I desperately needed help. After a few visits, I decided to turn my life around. I started dating someone new, and worked harder in my classes. I honestly don't really remember that summer, I think I worked a few jobs and had some fun doing other things.

Junior year of college was better, not much better, but better. I lived in the middle of campus and had three roommates who were okay. I made a lot of different friends and connections that year. I also found my passion of fitness and nutrition so I attacked it by storm and started eating really well and going to the gym frequently. I also ended up getting an internship for the summer following junior year at my colleges strength and conditioning program. 

That summer was unbelievable. I became closer with my female best friend and first friend at GW, also became really good friends with my roommates and did some amazing things. That summer is also when one of my brothers got married. I ended up bringing my best friend as my plus one. 

Now, this girl is amazing. She is one of my best friends, but I have liked her more than that on and off for almost 4 years. We've gone on a few dates, but nothing ended up happening. Secretly, I would marry this girl in a heart beat. 

Man, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] bored of writing more of this, but IM ALMOST DONE. Bear with me. Senior year was great. I made a lot of friends and did well in my classes and all together it was a great year. I graduated this past May. It was such a relief. March of this year, I bought study materials for a personal training exam I will take in August. 

Remember when I told you that my dad would leave again? Well, he did a few weeks ago. I more or less told him to. I knew how miserable he was with my mom. He didn't love her the same way he did 40 years ago. I get it. None of us care anymore. My siblings and everyone else knew this was going to happen, we're basically numb to the situation. My mom lately has become insufferable though. Currently, I am [REDACTED_NAME] for my PT exam and will most likely pass it, and I am ""seeing"" this 32 year old woman who has three kids. My life is actually getting better and I am [REDACTED_NAME] to see whats in store for my future. 

I honestly would not change anything about my life and what I have experienced. All of what happened as made me the man I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to be me. ",7
1h33ffu,1732937112.0,2024-11-30 03:25:12,self,I’m a millionaire and it cost me everything,"37M. Recently hit this milestone after committing myself to my career for the last 15 years. I thought just focus on you, build the future you’re envisioning and the rest will fall into place. Man was I wrong.  The only thing I have is my career. I’ve completely lost myself along the way.

I’m sitting alone in my apartment as the holiday weekend gets under way. Watching the city come to life as I feel I slowly succumb to the opposite force. My friends are all with their families and loved ones, most have small children of their own. Everyone is rightfully consumed with their family and close friends - I just don’t fit-in in most of those settings anymore. 

I could absolutely go out on my own, so I’m not throwing a pity party, it just doesn’t sound appealing to me. 

I’ve given up my hobbies as I never had time for them the last decade, or they no longer interest me. I am [REDACTED_NAME] to find love - some blame is certainly my own in this category but still feels like it’s been a gauntlet. And now most of the available women my age have baggage, kids, etc. Not exactly exciting. 

My friends who I grew up with look at me differently now that I’m successful. There is resentment. I went to intense graduate school and post-grad training during my twenties and  early thirties, I grew apart from and lost touch with many good friends.

I used to be incredibly extroverted and could talk to a wall. Now, not only does small talk and interacting with people seem pointless, I’ve realized I can barely keep a conversation anymore. Interaction with people is a task now, and usually a disappointing or at best unremarkable occurrence in my day. 

I’m a shell of my former self. I don’t have anything to offer anyone other than money. And that’s a worse feeling than having no money, which I’ve also experienced. 

In my tireless journey for success, I lost my humanity and there is no worse poverty to experience than that of connection. 

I hope this finds you well, and I implore you to nurture your connections. Love your family and spouse. Be present with the ones that matter. Lean into your friendships. There is no higher calling as a human than to brighten the world of those you love. That’s real wealth. 

In a world that’s obsessed with status and appearance, achievement and comparison, chasing these vague axioms will lead to a life of emptiness and regret. Be thankful for what you have and for those you love.  It’s the only currency that matters. 



Edit: the intent behind writing this was a cautionary tale to the young professionals and young adults, caution that trying to fulfill yourself and find meaning in life through accomplishment and finances alone will not suffice. To cherish the friends and family you’ve got if you’re lucky enough to have them. Many young people driven to achieve are running from something in their past, I was. it isn’t a valid coping mechanism, and I’m humbly realizing that now. 

I also want to recognize the spectrum on which suffering occurs. I assure you I am [REDACTED_NAME] of how my situation doesn’t hold a candle to most of human suffering. I’m not looking for pity and I appreciate the interaction with this post, even the negative comments have value to me. Be well, all. ",27273
1k9owz8,1745821496.0,2025-04-28 06:24:56,self,"A customer said to me today, “why would I have a card when I can just use my phone?”","The tap feature on my card reader was malfunctioning today, so I had to tell all my customers that they had to either swipe or insert their cards (if they didn’t have cash).

Of course I had a few people who only had their phones, as they had originally intended to just use Apple Pay, which I felt bad about but thankfully the majority of them took it in stride and were very understanding. This one girl though… she was immediately pissed and suspicious. She kept asking repeatedly why I couldn’t take tap and when I said the machine was mall functioning she got all mad and started accusing me of lying because, “that’s not how those machines work.”

I apologized multiple times and asked if she had a physical card she could use, instead of her phone and she looked at me like I was a moron and said, “why would I have a card when I can just use my phone?”

While I could understand her frustration at this scenario, that statement made very little sense to me.

As if the situation at hand wasn’t enough proof that that idea was flawed… like… a card can’t run out of batteries…

I have customers almost every day try and rush to pay with their phone only for the phone to die on them at the last second . It’s a VERY common occurrence in my experience.",7570
xk31bx,1663761883.0,2022-09-21 12:04:43,self,My parents don’t realize they’ve lost their youngest child,"Update!!!!!

Y’all yesterday was crazy! My mom tried calling a dozen times before I blocked her number. Never picked up once. Same with dad. Then my brother called. Told me how disappointed he was with me and how he can’t believe id just turn my back on them even when they “accepted your life of sin” since god hasn’t “fixed” me yet. I told him to never contact me again and hung up. Went on to block the rest of them after that just to protect my sanity. Also received a call from my therapist saying my folks had called her asking fir information and she wanted to see if i was ok. Had a long talk with her that made me feel more human. Spent the rest of the night watching movies and eating cake. Life feels strange and bright today but im looking forward to a long and happy life. Thanks for all the well wishes and support 



My (27 non-binary) parents don’t realize they’ve lost me. Over the last year I’ve grown more and more distant. I transferred my car title so that my father isnt a co-signer on it, closed the bank account my mother helped me open, transferred my phone plan to a new carrier, and moved out. 

On Friday they Will receive a letter in the mail containing the bank card my dad gave me for emergencies and a letter. Letter and tell them that I’m done. Done being the family scape goat. Done being gaslit and told that I am [REDACTED_NAME] good enough simply because I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of being expected to do all of the labor in their family while still being abused and I’m done. The letter will tell them that they are no longer welcome in my life or my found families lives. That they are to never contact me again and that should they try I will get a restraining order. 

After 27 years of abuse  they have lost the right to be called my parents and on Friday they will know they’ve lost their youngest child

EDIT: 
People seem confused on the abuse as i didnt add many details on that and rather than simply replying in the comments ill put this here. My parents do not believe in medicine which has lead to broken bones not being treated, serious illness being ignored, and serious chronic health conditions that will effect me for the rest of my life. Along with medical abuse there has been physical and verbal abuse and two separate attempts to deem me medically incompetent.  For those who are concerned about where i am [REDACTED_NAME] i am [REDACTED_NAME] living with my partners and working from home.  Thanks for all the well wishes and concerns for my safety i will update you all on how it goes ❤️",1634
1kedsv2,1746342226.0,2025-05-04 07:03:46,self,Guy and girl mutual friends told me their very different takes on their breakup with each other,"I have mutual friends who are dating. I guess were, now. They broke up over this weekend. Both called to tell me about the breakup. I’m going to share both their versions of what happened to show the power of perspective. And really because… I’m not a gossip, so I have no one in my real life to tell. 

Context, they met four weeks ago, they’ve been on about eight dates. This is my best paraphrase of how they recounted their stories to me, abridged for clarity’s sake. 

**HIS VERSION OF EVENTS:** 

I knew right away I’d found something special with this girl and I had to lock her down. She talked about how her issue in past relationships was the guys not wanting commitment and being squirrelly about putting labels on things. 

So I planned a whole nice romantic weekend for us. I surprised her with a romantic trip into New York City. She’d never been and she said she’d always wanted to go. I got us a nice Air BnB. I got us a fancy restaurant. Flowers. The whole thing was perfect. 

We’re outside the restaurant and I asked her, “Will you be my girlfriend?” She says yes. It’s all good. We go in and sit down to eat. Having a great conversation. Chilling and it’s all good. Midway through dinner she goes to the bathroom. Comes back and says she’s not feeling well. I ask if she wants to go back to the Air BnB. She says no, she just needs some air. 

She gets up and full on leaves. Leaves the whole city. Leaves her suitcase of clothes. Just leaves. She sends me a text and says she wasn’t feeling well so she went back home. Calls the next day and said she feels like things were moving too fast so she’d have to not see me anymore. I don’t know what happened. She won’t meet up with me to talk about it. I don’t know if she’s insane or I am. You just can’t win with women. I did literally exactly what she wanted.  



**HER VERSION OF EVENTS**

It’s too bad it didn’t work out because I actually really liked him. We had seen each other for a few weeks and were just at the stage where we were talking about what we wanted. 

I told him things didn’t work out with [my ex boyfriend] because after two years together he refused to be clear whether or not our relationship was leading to marriage or we were ultimately just “dating” and that at my age I’m not someone who’s comfortable dating just to socialize. I don’t know if that’s what started this whole mess, but I thought I had been pretty straightforward. 

So he tells me he’s planned a trip. He doesn’t ask me if I want to go on a trip, he *tells* me that he has booked and paid for a trip for us overnight out of town. It seemed like he was trying to do something nice and I wanted to see where things could go between us so I said fuck it, let’s take the trip. 

I was pressing him for details as to where we were going, where we were staying, how we were getting there, and he wouldn’t tell me any of that which made me uncomfortable. I know he’s been a friend of yours a long time but that only means so much to me, I’ve only ever met him a handful of times. 

So I find out he’s driving us in his personal car to New York City where I’ve never been and do not know anybody, do not know the agenda or plan. But I agreed to go, I feel like I’m being over-anxious. We go to this shady and unhygienic Air BnB and it is a studio apartment with one bed. There’s a couch so I’m rationalizing “I guess one of us is going to sleep on the couch?” 

I set my stuff down and I’m freaking out internally because I’ve never slept with this man and I had no intention to do so that weekend. I felt played. I felt like he’d taken advantage of me. Nothing leading up to that weekend physically between us should have led him to believe we were in a place in the relationship where we were about to have sex. He knows I’m just coming off this awful breakup and wanting to take things slow, I was careful to be sure he knew that. 

So we drive to this expensive restaurant in his personal car. He makes a point to say he’s going to pay for everything. And my stuff is at some Air BnB I can’t even remember the address to.  At this point I’m starting to get legitimately terrified. 

Then as we’re walking in he asks me “Will you be my girlfriend?”After not even a month of seeing each other, after getting me in a strange city with my stuff somewhere inaccessible, and my only mode of transportation his personal car. And one bed to share that coming night. I called my dad to get me a ticket home and I called an uber and I pretended to be sick so as not to offend him. 

He seemed like a nice guy with genuine intentions but you don’t know how a guy is going to take rejection at that level even if it’s an honest misunderstanding. I felt really upset. If he knew what he was doing he’s disgusting and if he didn’t know, he hasn’t been listening to me at all. So the next day I called and told him it was over. I can’t imagine what he was thinking.

72it09,1506411036.0,2017-09-26 07:30:36,self,"Posted a while back, you all were fantastic, but...","The earthquake hit me hard (I live in Mexico City). I'm [REDACTED_NAME] fine, and so is my family, but it really got to me.

I posted a while back that I felt lonely, and many of you resonated with said post. I think many of you thought that I was depressed or sad, I wasn't. I think sadness is now creeping towards me, and I no longer have the will to get out of the way.

The appt. I lived in was deemed too dangerous to inhabit. A friend, my neighbour, has nowhere to go and has been weeping for her family's safety. She is the only one living there, currently. My mother, me and our cats have moved to my father's house. 

I guess I should be grateful, but I honestly hate every cubic inch of this place. Everything feels so... alienating, as if I was physically here but the majority of my emotions were slowly draining away; this place is slowly poisoning me, and there's little I can do about it. I hate this situation, I abhor how manipulative my father, who makes sure we only clash and never coexist with one another, is and how his cancerous ways have formed a malevolent tumor in my brother's head.

I said last time I knew what depression was, and that was because I was driven to suicidal attempts by the very same people. I've since worked towards getting better, and I did, but it seems, to me, that everything I loved has crashed and burnt. I love mixing and producing music, yet, since the quake, I've had an unbearable tinnitus. I can't focus, and everything I look at turns to a smudge, where once I saw clearly. I hear blurrily, if that makes any sense. I feel tremors and have to watch how some cables I hung don't shake to know an earthquake isn't happening. I hear the sirens blaring in the middle  of the night. There's this impending sense of relief as if there is something, a flash of blinding light, that'd immediately take me away. I know I should feel fine that I just got a superficial cut out of this and move on. Hell, my appt. is repairable, and I know many people died or have nowhere to go.

I'd given up on my relationship with my father, being the anti-Middas: everything he touches turns to complete and utter shit. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to realize that my brother has become one of those things. My father has implanted the seed of discord into my brother's head, and there's naught but disdain and resentment for us.

To contextualize this, I have to tell my story. When I was 15, a friend's mother got lung cancer. I helped her and her mother every time I could until I just couldn't anymore. I was just depleted in every sense. At the same time, I was ignored by my family, and dedicated no time towards bettering myself or talking with pretty much anyone else. I felt suicidal, and talked to my mother about it. There is something surreal in telling someone close that you want to kill yourself. 

We planned and took a trip, fueled by credit, to Europe with a friend of my mom's. Everything was so real, and I managed to see that there are more things to life other than being the perfect student for a subject you hate and living the life a full colostomy-bag imposed on you. That was my turning point and I 

So I sought and found an amazing opera singer who taught me all I know about spirituality and singing that I know. I studied under her tutoring for a couple of years and found a reason to live. In that time, I moved out of my father's place into my now-empty appt.

I loved for the very first time. I was loved as well. I finally remembered what not being empty inside felt. I knew I had cost my mother hundreds of thousands of pesos in debt, but it was all worth it. She was changed, too. There's a sublime satisfaction in changing someone's life for the better; turns out she'd tried to kill herself many times, since I was little, with complete disregard of how I'd be left alone with a leech who feasts on souls. She now had, as well, some motivation back in her life, helping me out and caring for her cats and me.

My brother, having formed a codependency with my father, stayed with him, and started growing a resentment towards us. I attribute it to me being in search of my happiness and well being. I feel he's struck mediocrity in every personal development sense. I felt, and still feel, saddened by his stunt in growth, but my mental health and potential for happiness is more important to me than anything else.

And that's what my place meant to me. It's a symbol of my will to get better; to find and value myself.

And I can't help but feel like that has just been taken away for me.

I feel like I've been stolen that, and that I've regressed all those years' development I put all my hard work into, and everything's terrible again.

I fear falling back into depression, and had to get all this ""negrura"" (blackness, I guess) out of my soul. To everyone who read this, I hope you've found happiness and can work towards it. I'll be happy for everyone who's working hard in bettering themselves.

To everyone who feels like they live in a black hole that consumes all feelings and will, you are not alone. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of you whenever I work hard to stop feeling empty, and I hope you find your way in this convoluted maze that is life.

Note: many people IRL know my handle. Nothing of this is a secret, but many things are told in passing, and lack perspective. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if you disagree with how I felt this, but this is my reality based on my perception. I may be wrong to how you see my story, but, to me, it doesn't get any more real than this.

Thoughts and prayers to everyone who's been affected by this, Harvey, Irma, Maria amongst other things. We'll prosper, I'm [REDACTED_NAME].",3
1hbeze6,1733871798.0,2024-12-10 23:03:18,self,"Before you make up your mind on Luigi Mangione based on what the media tells you about him, know that his Reddit account paints its own picture of who he is","There's reason to believe that [REDACTED_USER] is the UHC shooting suspect Luigi Mangione. Credit to [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/spinalfusion/comments/1hajvwr/luigi_mangiones_spinal_fusion_looks_like_an_l5s1/m19pau7/) which is where I first saw this. Dug into the account for the fun of it.

The account is suspended, so all record of its posts/comments comes from Reddit archives.

Archive of all posts from the account: [Primary](https://search.pullpush.io/?kind=submission&author=mister_cactus&size=100), [Secondary](https://ihsoyct.github.io/?mode=submissions&subreddit=&sort_type=created_utc&sort=desc&limit=100&after=&before=&author=Mister_cactus&score=&num_comments=&q=)

Both primary/secondary links should have the same content, but included both in case one goes down or something.

## Proof

It's known that he has a Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, and more, while being a tech bro, so it's no surprise that he'd be on Reddit as well.

Here are some snippets of evidence that I compiled in order to prove that the account belonged to Mangione. Note that the first point here is pretty cut and dry, everything else just further confirms it.

**Linked to his own GitHub**

He commented [this](https://i.imgur.com/mqwhbCy.png) on r/FTC (robotics competition for high schoolers?). Notice that it links to his code on GitHub ... and it's Luigi Mangione's GitHub. Yeah, pretty cut and dry lol.

He was in fact into robotics in high school (and he would be in high school in 2016 so that checks out).

Unfortunately I typed the rest of this out before finding that piece of definitive evidence, so here it is if anyone's curious:

**Attended the University of Pennsylvania during the same time frame**

Luigi Mangione graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020. This [image](https://i.imgur.com/rtAqHfZ.png) shows that the Reddit account posted a question about housing in r/UPenn in 2017, which would check out.

**Was a computer science undergraduate student**

Luigi Mangione majored in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. This [image](https://i.imgur.com/sVwtKXI.png) shows that the Reddit account made a post where he says ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] undergraduate pursuing a degree in computer science,"" again lining up with when he was at UPenn.

**Same age**

In 2018, the Reddit account made a post to r/sleep. Here's an [image](https://i.imgur.com/EfsAt4t.png).

It mentions being a 20-year-old male. 2018 was 6 years ago, and he is now 26-years-old, so this lines up (I do not think we know his exact day of birth).

**Shared an interest in Ted Kaczynski**

According to Mangione's GoodReads account, he left a positive review for the Ted Kaczynski's manifesto and called him a prodigy and political revolutionary. [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/person-interest-unitedhealthcare-shooting-gave-[REDACTED_PHONE]70.html). 

The Reddit account likely posted [this video](https://np.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1czali0/streaming_overdose_2024_china/) to r/tedkaczynski. Technically all we know is that he had a post on r/tedkaczynski with the same title as the post I just linked and his post was two days after the original - we can't see what the attached video was. Given the identical title and being in the same week, it was likely a crosspost. 

[IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/UKC4y43.png)

**Had serious back problems**

The Reddit account was very active on r/Spondylolisthesis. According to Google, ""Spondylolisthesis is a condition where a vertebra in the spine slips out of place, usually in the lower back.""

This includes [this post](https://i.imgur.com/GRX4hhD.png) where he listed athletic success stories as motivation to other people suffering from the condition.

[Here's](https://www.foxnews.com/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-murder-suspect-luigi-mangione-complained-about-back-surgery-before-slaying) a news article that mentions Luigi Mangione's back problems. 

**Aggravated injury due to surfing**

Last year (2023), the Reddit account says that they're 25M (again, age lines up) and says, ""I first aggravated my spondy 1.5 years ago after surfing."" [Image](https://i.imgur.com/0Mux0In.png)

This lines up with Luigi Mangione. The [following article](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/luigi-mangione-charged-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting/) says:

> CBS News has also learned Mangione had been living at a co-working, co-living space called Surfbreak in Honolulu up until 2022, when a spokesperson for that community says he left due to a lifelong back injury that was exacerbated by surfing and hiking.

> Sources tell CBS News back pain was a major factor in his life and appeared to be a source of pain and frustration for him.  

**Shared an interest in Agronomics**

According to Google, ""Agronomics is a London-listed company that invests in cellular agriculture, which is the production of agricultural products from microorganisms and cell cultures. Agronomics uses biotechnology, synthetic biology, and tissue engineering to produce proteins, fats, or tissues""

[Here is a post from Luigi's Twitter account talking about the company.](https://nitter.poast.org/PepMangione/status/[REDACTED_PHONE][REDACTED_PHONE]02#m)

Ton of comments from the Reddit account on r/agronomics, [here's an image of a few](https://i.imgur.com/dxglYEP.png).

**Lived in Hawaii at some point**

I don't know Luigi Mangione's entire life story, but the surfing thing occurred in Hawaii and his LinkedIn has his location as Hawaii. Well, in 2023 this Reddit account commented on r/Oahu that he loves stargazing at ""Ke'ana Point"". Here's an [image](https://i.imgur.com/7mGJHuY.png). That's in Hawaii.

## Takeaways

Okay, now that we know that it's him... what does the Reddit account tell us?

Here are some things that I noticed from its comment history.

**He's a kind guy**

Most of his Reddit activity is on r/Spondylolisthesis and it's rather uninteresting in the sense that it's... mostly just him being nice to other people, giving them advice and motivation.

Here are some quotes from r/Spondylolisthesis specifically.

- ""You'll do great, whatever you decide. [...] We can't be afraid to live our own lives to the fullest!""
- ""Of course. Also feel free to DM me if you have any questions in the future""
- ""Sorry you're also a member of this shitty club, but know that you'll be fine whatever you decide""
- ""Hope that helps and sorry you have to go through this""
- ""Surgery is scary, but the sooner you get past this, the better. Good luck with the neurosurgeon consult!""

Pretty mundane stuff, but with how much douchebaggery you see on the Internet, it's a breath of fresh air in a sense. Most of these are parts of longer comments where he gives detailed thoughts / advice, you can see those in the archive.

**Some of his interests include**

Football: he commented on r/nflmemes and r/fantasyfootball

Pokémon Go: he commented on r/pokemongo back in 2016, along with r/pokemongodev nd r/TheSilphRoad.

Flipping: he commented on r/Flipping and r/ThriftStoreHauls

Bioinformatics: he commented on r/bioinformatics

""One Bag"": he was active on r/onebag in 2024. According to the subreddit description, it is ""an 'urban' travel community devoted to the idea of helping people lug around less crap; onebag travel""

**He was struggling in more ways than one**

On top of his back problems, he commented on r/BrainFog, r/visualsnow, and r/ibs.

According to WebMD, ""Brain fog isn’t a medical condition. It’s a term used for certain symptoms that can affect your ability to think. You may feel confused or disorganized or find it hard to focus or put your thoughts into words.""

According to Wikpedia, ""Visual snow syndrome (VSS) is an uncommon neurological condition in which the primary symptom is that affected individuals see persistent flickering white, black, transparent, or colored dots across the whole visual field.""

And IBS is irritable bowel syndrome.

And for what it's worth, the brain fog activity was in 2018, before COVID (it's apparently a reported symptom of COVID).

Here's a neat snippet of a long form comment on r/BrainFog during his time at UPenn six years ago.

> Working through the degree has certainly been tougher than anything I ever even thought I could handle. Granted, I went from almost entirely A’s at a tough school to just passing my classes and not understanding anything while putting in probably twice the amount of work.

> Funny how you mention strategy games. Last year when it all started, I used to play chess daily against my roommate. I used it as a metric to see how the brain fog was improving. Eventually, I just stopped since I could never remember any strategy. He would use the same moves against me day after day and I just wouldn’t remember them.

> I think it helps to latch onto something for motivation. My choice to study CS and Bio wasn’t completely random - after spending so much time with brain fog, I’ve come to realize how little is understood about it, and I’d love to change that. Once I get past this, I hope to at least help a few of the people on this sub.

[Here's an image of the whole comment](https://i.imgur.com/aXFr7If.png).

**Miscellaneous**

There are two other random Reddit comments he had outside of his usual subreddits that I found somewhat interesting.

Both of these comments were on an r/facepalm post from April 2024 about Elon Musk having a transgender daughter.

One specific comment thread made fun of Musk for being high on ketamine, and then a random Redditor basically argued that people should be more open minded about substances that can be used to treat depression. The comment was downvoted, and Mangione replied ""Weird double standard by reddit here regarding treatments for depression. Now sure how this is being downvoted"". [Image here](https://i.imgur.com/d3ySr6U.png). There is some evidence on Mangione's Twitter defending drug use as well, including psychedelics.

This other exchange was on the same post about Musk. 

- A user commented ""Feels pretty silly to not believe there is at least some social contagion element at play."" They sit at -58 points on this comment.

- A person replied ""I grew up really religious and still turned out trans. Just took me years of depression because my family wouldn't accept. No one ever talked about trans people.""

- Original commenter said ""DID I SAY TRANS PEOPLE DONT EXIST FOR FUCKS SAKE? This is why no one can have a conversation. 10 downvotes and been reported already for saying there might be some aspect of growing trans population resulting from social contagion. Fuck me, I guess I’m just satan.""

- There was a long back-and-forth between these two fellas, as Reddit tends to go, but at this point Mangione's account replied and said: ""This is one of the crazier comment threads I've seen on reddit, that reminds me how much of an echo chamber this site is. How the hell are you being reported for merely suggesting that both ""nature"" and ""nuture"" play roles in human behavior. Literally nothing bigoted or controversial about that statement.""

## The elephant in the room

The obvious questions: Did he talk about healthcare? UHC? Brian Thompson?

No bomb shells, exactly.

In 2018, in a thread on r/IBS, a user asked him if insurance covered a test that Mangione received from his doctor.

Mangione's account responded that ""BCBS covered my test"". [Image](https://i.imgur.com/Mjj4XM8.png)

Now, that was six years ago, but for what it's worth, BCBS is ""Blue Cross Blue Shield"". They are NOT United Healthcare (UHC). They're actually the company that recently received criticism for a newly announced anesthesia payment policy and ended up reversing it in light of Brian Thompson's death. [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/anthem-blue-cross-blue-shield-time-limits-anesthesia-surgery-rcna183035)

This doesn't really mean anything because it was six years ago.

The only other somewhat adjacent thing that I found was a comment in response to a post where somebody asked for help convincing a surgeon that they needed spinal fusion surgery because their pain is unbearable.

Mangione's account gave multiple suggestions, including: ""Tell them you are ""unable to work"" / do your job. We live in a capitalist society. I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life."" [Image of the full comment](https://i.imgur.com/B3w4X0u.png).

## Conclusion

It would be silly for me to tell you not to blindly trust the media and then tell you to blindly trust me. So do your own research if you're interested. The links at the top of the post will allow you to do so.

My take?

Kind-hearted, smart kid. Suffered from a host of problems, far more than anybody, let alone a young man in their 20s should deal with.

According to his Reddit activity, he suffered from:

- Debilitating back pain
- Irritable bowel syndrome
- Brain fog
- Visual snow

Nonetheless, he came to Reddit to help others with the same problems and give them the same motivation that seemed to help him.

I won't speculate on why he did what he did for the sake of objectivity, but I hope people engage on the topic with a better sense of who he might've been, because there will certainly be an attempt to paint him in a specific way.",30307
4nko58,1465633999.0,2016-06-11 08:33:19,self,it all started with cough syrup,"I have a story to tell. It has two beginnings: one in my childhood and one later with cough syrup.  

It starts with me as a young lad growing up in a Christian family: going to church, Bible lessons: all that Jazz. Only problem was, I never felt any of it. I remember sitting in church watching people singing and I would think, what is everyone getting that I am [REDACTED_NAME]? I remember praying and reading the Bible, and thinking, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] doing it right. There must be something wrong with me.   

I remember always feeling like things weren't 'real.' I think I was dissociated for a majority of my life. Sometimes not as much but sometimes to where I felt like I didn't know anything at all. 

I remember when I was around 12 or 13, and I started thinking about why is the Bible true? I tried to stop the doubts, but it felt like my faith slipped away just like sand in my hands. It actually took me a about five years, until I was 18, to really stop believing. I remember thinking ""Well, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a Christian, but I just don't believe any of it."" That's when it finally fell away.  

But there was something I was unaware of. Even though I didn't believe, I realize now that I had this deep, deep shame about being 'sinful' and 'bad' that was under the surface that took me ten more years to get rid of.  

What I did was, I used being superior to counteract the shame. I was good at school, straight A's, and I used that to counteract the shame. In college, when I realized that was going to go away I fell into a deep depression and quit going to classes. My friend said it was like I died.   

After coming home from failing college, I was at home and I got a janitorial job and I would come home every night and go online all night, just numbing myself with the screen. I would eat to feel better. I remember I would go to Burger King and get a double whopper meal, and then after work I would get another double meal and eat it in the parking lot, and then go to Taco Bell and bring that home so my parents would only know about the Taco Bell. One time I made a whole box of pasta and just ate it all in my bed.  

A couple times between the ages of 20 and 27, I would 'come out' of my dissociation. I would go into mania, and they would last about two weeks. One time I got obsessed with Bowling a perfect 300 and I managed to get six strikes in a row at my best. I remember this idea, that if I could just do something great I would be 'okay.'  

 One time I got obsessed with women's rights. I remember emphasizing with woman in an extreme way, to where I would see men as what I thought women saw: bigger and stronger and deep voices and capable of violence and more powerful. I would actually **see** them that way. I remember being able to 'shift' between seeing men the way I saw them before and now instantaneously, like they would grow in size and then I could shrink them back and forth.   

I had disturbing visions. I would see some men as being just pure evil and I would gag when I saw their demon eyes. I remember one older man slapping a table and his slap sounded like rape. I remember feeling like I was on a mission: I had to wake everyone up to this reality that everyone was missing.  

I would watch current tv shows with men and women and I would see them like they were old shows from the 50's, like I was viewing them from fifty years in the future. I felt a lot of distress about people not understanding what I was experiencing.  

I would often come home from work and just feeling anxious all night, so I would cope with eating. I researched and started taking some cough syrup, because I read about the mental effects it can have. The first times I took the minimum threshold to have an effect, I would look at images online and see them have a strange quality. I realized I was seeing 'beauty', perhaps for the first time. I would marvel at it. It felt like an effect, like a photoshop effect painted over real life.  

I would go into the bathroom and just stare at the mirror. Sometimes I would see a version of myself that was ghastly and strange and odd and I would call it 'the horror.' One time I sat on the toilet and I just stared at the wall and I could feel what felt like my brain loading, it felt like layer after layer being built and like a pitch that is going higher and higher and deeper.  

The effect would always go away. I took a higher and higher dose. I remember when I took the highest 'safest' dose at about 20 mg/kg and I went to the movies and I 'woke up' over and over in a strange world and I would control the screen with two pieces of licorice and when I walked out of the theater, the whole world was small and far away and vivid and strange.  

I got into a state where I thought that I had to go above and beyond and it would 'heal' me. I took about 25 mg/kg and I went into the tub and I started falling into pleasure. I remember seeing the water come out in slow motion and feeling pure heat and seeing my body and muscles and falling back into bliss. The tub started spinning and I held on as it spinned around and around. I 'woke up' to find my gripping the edge of the sink just shaking and covered in sweat as I would spin around and around over and over and I desperately tried not to fall.   

I came out of the bathroom in my friend's house and I started seeing her as really far away, and my hands were tiny. They were obviously freaked out. I remember 'waking up' and I was shocked to be real and time was ticking by and I had a voice and had choices and I was overjoyed. But I started shaking and the my vision began spinning around my head.   

They called an ambulance and I felt like I was in a horror movie. My lips were numb and I could only speak in single words. I remember thinking I would be like this for the rest of my life. When I was in the hospital that night, the culmination of that trip was me feeling iike I was a pulsing star in my mind.   

After that, I got home and for a couple weeks I had much more mental ability and could think and do things. This went away and for the next couple of years I tried therapy to see what was wrong. I would do the cough syrup from time to time, at a lower dose and would wake up and see people as real and feel like I was alive.  

Just recently, I would took large doses of marijuana to try to see if it helped. I took a liquid form that contained 200 mg of THC. The next couple of days, I would be seeing the world as 'almost' real. I would see the world as if it was split into two in my mind. I feel like I am [REDACTED_NAME] there now, as the world is getting more and more real.   

I think I have been dealing with feeling ashamed for being 'bad' according to Christian theology my whole life. I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure that I am [REDACTED_NAME] getting rid of the belief. I feel like I shouldn't have been able to function at all. I remember my parents saying they loved me, and I would hear the words but not really know what they meant. I remember one scary time when I had this idea that I could get rid of my shame by hurting other people, and for a brief period of time feeling like I was a serial killer and I empathized with wanting to kill people and torture them. I was glad I had the capacity to not act on that and let it pass through me.  

It has given me a lot of experiences through which I can emphasize with people. I feel like I know what it's like to have an addiction and feel like you 'have' to do this thing that will kill you and no one understands and if you have this once chance you need to take it. Or to feel like everyone is almost cruel in how oblivious to how empty you feel and you are all alone and all your emptiness justifies hurting people to feel alive. Or feeling like a schizophrenic who just 'knows' something that everyone thinks is crazy and you feel like no one understands and you are on a mission. Or feeling like you have to be 'perfect' to be acceptable. I know what it's like to be 'unintelligent' and confused and frustrated and also what it's like to be extremely perceptive and know things intuitively. 

Anyway, that's my story. It is still ongoing and I think it is finally getting better.",5
1iurasy,1740145714.0,2025-02-21 13:48:34,self,Online racism affects me a lot less when I realized most people are dumb,"As a non white guy, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] who was quite affected by the massive increase in online racism on social media. For those unaware, there's been a big increase of racism against muslims, indians and black people in the last year or so

Predictably, it did make me very depressed and bother me a lot. However, over the last few days, something has began to change

After being constantly exposed to the content, I began looking at the accounts of people making such comments. It was often the case that whenever these racist commenters tried defending their comments, they put forward very very dumb arguments

It was also the case that much of the time, these accounts had brainrot on their profiles or were blue-collar types

As someone who studied at a very prestigious university and has two degrees, something clicked in me - most of these people are just dumb. Many are uneducated, and those that are educated, are often at lower tier universities

I came to the realization that most of these people are dumb, and they are destined to not do much with their lives. Their futures will be full of debt, divorce, health issues, etc. And most people won't be able to climb out of the place they're in

And what reinforced my belief that most people are stupid, was looking at what society is like now. Streamers such as Adin Ross (pure brainrot) being made famous/rich, half the country electing the orange man (who is a complete half wit), etc

When you really and truly internalize that you are smarter than most people, and that most people are dumb and will live very unhappy lives, you begin to not value what they think or say. And thus whenever I see a lot of racist comments, it doesn't bother me as much anymore",234

I'll say this as a gay guy in a college town in South Carolina: a TON of the gay guys here voted Trump. All the closeted/Dl guys seem to be Trump supporters (guys I've hooked up with posting MAGA stuff on their snap story for example). 

Our community is really small and everyone knows each other, so I have a fairly accurate sample of the gay population here. She straight up just failed to appeal to anyone who doesn't care about DEI/trans issues.",15111
1glywd1,1731007939.0,2024-11-07 19:32:19,self,Here's my wake-up call as a Liberal.,"I’m a New York liberal, probably comfortably in the 1% income range, living in a bubble where empathy and social justice are part of everyday conversations. I support equality, diversity, economic reform—all of it. But this election has been a brutal reminder of just how out of touch we, the so-called “liberal elite,” are with the rest of America. And that’s on us.

America was built on individual freedom, the right to make your own way. But baked into that ideal is a harsh reality: it’s a self-serving mindset. This “land of opportunity” has always rewarded those who look out for themselves first. And when people feel like they’re sinking—when working-class Americans are drowning in debt, scrambling to pay rent, and watching the cost of everything from groceries to gas skyrocket—they aren’t looking for complex social policies. They’re looking for a lifeline, even if that lifeline is someone like Trump, who exploits that desperation.

For years, we Democrats have pushed policies that sound like solutions to us but don’t resonate with people who are trying to survive. We talk about social justice and climate change, and yes, those things are crucial. But to someone in the heartland who’s feeling trapped in a system that doesn’t care about them, that message sounds disconnected. It sounds like privilege. It sounds like people like me saying, “Look how virtuous I am,” while their lives stay the same—or get worse.

And here’s the truth I’m facing: as a high-income liberal, I benefit from the very structures we criticize. My income, my career security, my options to work from home—I am [REDACTED_NAME] from many of the struggles that drive people to vote against the establishment. I can afford to advocate for changes that may not affect me negatively, but that’s not the reality for the majority of Americans. To them, we sound elitist because we are. Our ideals are lofty, and our solutions are intellectual, but we’ve failed to meet them where they are.

The DNC’s failure in this election reflects this disconnect. Biden’s administration, while well-intentioned, didn’t engage in the hard reflection necessary after 2020. We pushed Biden as a one-term solution, a bridge to something better, but then didn’t prepare an alternative that resonated. And when Kamala Harris—a talented, capable politician—couldn’t bridge that gap with working-class America, we were left wondering why. It’s because we’ve been recycling the same leaders, the same voices, who struggle to understand what working Americans are going through.

People want someone they can relate to, someone who understands their pain without coming off as condescending. Bernie was that voice for many, but the DNC didn’t make room for him, and now we’re seeing the consequences. The Democratic Party has an empathy gap, but more than that, it has a credibility gap. We say we care, but our policies and leaders don’t reflect the urgency that struggling Americans feel every day.

If the DNC doesn’t take this as a wake-up call, if they don’t make room for new voices that actually connect with working people, we’re going to lose again. And as much as I want America to progress, I’m starting to realize that maybe we—the privileged liberals, safely removed from the realities most people face—are part of the problem.",15137

wmb8c,1342401721.0,2012-07-16 01:22:01,self,What should I do?,"We all have a story to tell; some have short, some have long ones to share. It can be the discovery of your first love, maybe even one of a cuddle-animal you kept since you were a child. All that matters for it to qualify is for it to hold significance for you. 
       This is mine, the story of my transition into an adult and the story of the loss of my ”innocence”.

I once had it all; money, friends, looks, physique and confidence. I was constantly happy; and every day brought a smile to my face. (Over-reacting here now, but the point is that life was good)

That was over one year ago, and since then I have lost what mattered most of those things, I lost my self and I have lost my happiness. Take a moment and listen to my story. It is a story about love. Let me warn you though, it is a long story. 

Two years ago, counting from today, ninth grade was coming to an end; it was to be the end of our group that had been created during our years together. At the end of ninth grade we were six friends, six close friends. We were all going to different schools, different classes and if it were not for our gaming group having been born; we would had missed out on loads of fun. 
It is time to introduce the characters of this story, the people of my gaming group. 

Social Awkward: First up, we have Social Awkward. He is the one that always fails his jokes, the guy that can never read the mood and thus says the wrong things at the wrong moment. But in the end you can’t deny the fact that he has a good heart. He just happens to be a catastrophe on interacting with other people.
Odd Friend: I always looked up to my odd friend; he’s an intelligent, friendly fellow. And like Social Awkward, good-hearted like few. We’ve known each other since fifth grade, but back then he found me rather annoying. He was my rival in a way and I always tried to compete with him. But I grew out of that rather quickly and we have since then been good friends. Odd friend never cared what everyone else thought about him. He was different and he knew it. 
Pretty Boy: Pretty boy is girlish in his looks and additionally quite unfit. As long as I’ve known him he has always had long blond hair, longer than most girls. Highly intelligent, asocial, but he’s way too arrogant. 

Indian boy: The social guy of the group, he’s the one that went to all the parties and had all the ladies. Why the name you ask? He’s half Indian and half Norway. An interesting mix if you ask me. He’s a great friend with everyone in the group, but especially good friend are Viking and Indian Boy, they go long back.

Viking: Aaaand then we have Viking, he’s the tallest one of us, and with his blond curly hair and blue eyes he makes the perfect Aryan. A running joke in the group is that he is “the eternal leader” of our gaming group. He is also the trendsetter in our group .Viking is hard to explain; he is rough on the outside but can be the nicest person I know of. He might be harsh to those that he does not call friend, but to those he does; he is a friend you will not regret having! 

Me: And then we have me, the meatball: Today I am a liar, a betrayer, fake, a…empty shell and much more. Back then though, I was the short guy with red hair and glasses, oh and a bit chubby. This combination was what gave me the nickname Meatball for a while. 

All of us were nerds in some regards, myself though? God, we were weird now that I think about it. And we still are. We mostly just used to play Magic The Gathering during the lunch breaks, that was until Viking told me his stories of roleplaying games. 

You see, Vikings father was a veteran role-player, so Viking had some experience with roleplaying games. Viking got me interested in roleplaying so Viking and I organized the group to come together for a game. Hell, I even remember the game of ours, we were terrible. But…we had fun. On a random note, that was also the day that I chopped the head of Social Awkward (‘s character), oh poor Social Awkward. 

That day was our gaming group born. Roleplaying became a regular thing, and we began playing every weekend; usually on Saturdays. Our friendship was not to end because the end of ninth grade. No, it was to become stronger. Yet…as high school began, things began to change with us all. 

This is when the real story begins, ninth grade was over, we all was about to split up to different schools, different classes. Things were bound to change.

I had decided that the end of ninth grade would signal the start of my own change. It was time I got into shape. I started training, it was hard at first. But I kept training; taking the bike to school as often as possible combined with regular morning joggings. I ran for twenty minutes, each morning before school. God…it was hard. After each run I kept grasping my chest due to the pains I felt. Almost crying for how pathetic I felt. Eventually I moved on to visiting the Gym with my brother. But I did not give up; I kept training until it paid off.  Until I became fit.
During the same time, Viking and I became closer and closer friends. We began to text regularly, mostly because I was bored a lot but also because I enjoyed his company greatly. He was my best friend. 
To be honest, this was the happiest time of my life. It was the peak of my happiness.
But I began telling lies, small lies. Not lies to Viking, but lies to everyone else that I didn’t care as much about.  It was small lies, often to Indian boy as I wanted to impress him. Lies about girlfriends, sex etc. I wanted to look cool, so I lied. The problem with this however, that I didn’t knew back then; was that lies spread, they spread quickly. 

Viking soon heard about my lies. You see, Indian Boy and Viking were friends since long back and they talked, they talked a lot.  Viking was disappointed that he had not gotten to hear the news from me first-handed, instead from Indian Boy. I was afraid that Viking would be disappointed in me even more for lying to Indian Boy. So I lied again. I kept expanding the small lie I had told, in order to make the lies more realistic. So much that the lies felt like the truth to me. This was my first wrong doing towards Viking.

At the beginning of the first term in our new terms Viking began to visit me regularly at school during his breaks, I loved that he did. Though I believe I never showed it entirely. At the same time as I loved spending time with Viking, I wanted to spend time with my new classmates, to get to know them better. Viking understood though and as a result ended his visits. Much to my dismay, I didn’t want him to stop completely. We kept hanging out after-school and gaming nights though, and despite that incident we grew closer as time passed by. 
However…one night. One fateful night, my relationship with Viking changed forever. After one gaming night over at Social Awkward, Viking and I was about to sleep over. That night Viking and I were lying on the floor, both of us unable to sleep. Meanwhile Social Awkward slept soundly above us in his bed. I tried to do my best to sleep when I suddenly felt a hand go under my sheet, up along my thighs. Stroking me gently, and caressing me. Slowly…slowly the hand drifted into my pants. I feigned asleep.
I didn’t know what to do; I was basically panicking at this point. “What the hell is he doing?! This is so wrong…yet it feel so good”…so I moved closer to him, without saying a word. It did not take long for him to make me cum.

He…he grabbed a hold of my hand, and made me do the same to him. Yet…I stopped whenever he was close to cum, and promised to make it up to him later. I didn’t want to make a mess, and my thoughts constantly drifted towards Social Awkward, who was despite this sleeping heavily. It felt so wrong, so very…very wrong. After a while I managed to convince Viking that we should go to sleep. I felt so tired and hoped if I went to sleep it would somehow turn out tomorrow that it was just a dream.

It was not.
The following day, Viking and I were waiting for the bus on the way home to him. I told him what had happened during the night was wrong, and I could not allow it to continue. He was saddened of course, yet he kept it all inside him. I was sorry to hurt him, but I was so confused, still so shocked. I needed time, time to think; time to take in what had happened. 
I never took that time for myself though and I have no one to blame but myself for that. It spiraled into an admittedly horrible relationship. Thoughts I clearly remembers are among ”Did I love him? Did he love me? Is this right? This is happening so quickly…”
Viking and I, despite my initial rejection started a relationship. To be honest, I can’t remember a thing about how it happened, how it could turn into a relationship after that day waiting for the bus.  How did we become a couple after I rejected him? I can’t remember.
But I do remember the happy times that follow that and acts that caused him great pain. Example would be that often times I never told him that I loved him. Despite the many times he told me that he loved me. I couldn’t do it most of the times, I just couldn’t do it. I wanted to…but I couldn’t without lying. Other acts would include things such as me refusing to kiss him in public. 

During our relationship, I didn’t believe most of the times that he loved me. It felt so wrong. We were both guys, and I had never ever looked at other males in that way. 

I remember one time, a memory that has been specially carved into my mind. It was a month or two into our relation, and he had convinced me to do a blowjob on him a few times before. I didn’t really want to do it; I hated the thought of it at first. But I wanted to please him; I wanted to repay him in some way. For he always told me he loved me, and I felt so guilty to him for I wasn’t able to repay him.

One day, I asked him to return the favor, for him to do the same to me. He told me he couldn’t do it. I…decided to leave early that day. I didn’t spoke much on the way to the bus. And all the while he kept saying how he was sorry for it, and asked me continuously if I was mad at him. I told him no. Really much more than that, I didn’t say. 

However…once alone on the bus. The tears started flowing, for I had convinced myself that he didn’t love me if he could not sacrifice it too. It took me a little while, but eventually I managed to convince myself that such a thing didn’t matter after all. Yet I still didn’t fully believe he loved me. Despite how much he told me so. 
Days passed, until almost half a year had passed since we initiated this relation. Then, I did another terrible thing to Viking. Without a word, suddenly I shut of all contact with him for five days. I needed to think. 

I had to decide, either I would end this relation and let him be loved by someone hat could. Or I would love him back fully. No more tests of his love. Just…pure love. I would accept his love, and in turn accept my love for him, as he deserved. 

I chose the latter. However….when I returned, I had lost him to someone else. During these days of isolation I had accepted that I loved him. It took me almost six months to do so, but when I finally did so; it was too late. 

I entered a state of shock, I shut of these feelings. Buried them so deep inside of me that I forgot that they ever existed. 

The problems didn’t end as Viking and I ended our commitment to each other. No, they became a lot more complicated. 

During my and Vikings relation, Pretty boy had also discovered love. He had found an intelligent and beautiful woman. She was special in so many ways. Her name in this story will be “Angel”. A fitting name for the person that would come to leave such a huge impact on me. 

The following day, after our break up. I found out who I had lost my Viking to. It was Angel. I was absolutely stunned by this, I was shocked beyond belief. “Angel was together with Pretty Boy…”

Days passed, and I was stone cold. It was like Viking and I were never together to start with. It was just like before, good old friends. I ended up taking care of Viking a lot. Often telling him that Angel would surely chose him of the two, for he deserved her. They deserved each other. My time was also spent persuading Viking to tell the unknowing Pretty Boy of their affair. He deserved to know. I never succeeded at my task, and quickly abandoned it once I realized they would tell him, one day; when the time was ready. They didn’t want to hurt him. 

After a few months had passed, all of my pent up feelings burst out. I came clean with my feelings to Viking. Told him I loved him, this time I was certain of it myself. He…accepted my love in a way. 

But he was still in love with Angel. A month passed when I was back with Viking and Viking together with Angel.  When Viking told me that I should talk to someone, with these feelings of mine, for I wasn’t stable. I was in a way sad very often; I had lost control of my feelings after having them pent up for so long. Viking told me that Angel had offered to help me.  Viking pleaded me to take her offer, I didn’t heed his words. I needed someone to talk to, someone that could understand. I didn’t even listen to his reasons. I was too caught up by the fact that she would want to help me. I wanted so badly for someone to save me, and there my savior was. 

I told her everything, every little detail, every little feeling. I opened up to her like I have done to no one else, like I believe will never open up again.  In return she opened up to me, Angel told me of her past and her feelings. She promised to always protect me, to always shelter me from every bad thing. To hurt, those who would hurt me. 

She became my sanctuary, my goddess and my angel. I was safe with her. I didn’t know what it was at first, but she evoked feelings that I had never felt before. I wrote texts in order to convey my appreciation and love towards her. Sometimes long, sometimes short. 

It didn’t take me long to realize what it was, it was love. But not love as I wanted her, no. It was love as one would love his mother. It was love as one would love a brother. I loved her more then I loved myself. 

In inspiration of Angel I had taken up writing texts in various forms in order to convey my feelings. I still occasionally write a text piece or two when the mood arises. 
After that month Angel hade made her choice. She chose Viking and Viking chose her in return. 

This crushed me, it wasn’t unexpected. But that didn’t prevent me from being devastated. I was hurt beyond belief and entered the bottom of my depression that left scars which still lingers to this day. I wanted to die. 
The same day that Angel and Viking chose each other Angel broke up with Pretty Boy and Pretty Boy much like me entered a depression. 

But my friendship with Angel didn’t start for long. Maybe it didn’t start correctly; maybe it was never correct at any point. After only four months our friendship came into an end. 

One day after spending my time over at her house, everything changed by telling her a single sentence. 

“I want to die.” 

Everything changed by those words. I had said so before, during the initial stages of my depression, but that was long since I last mentioned any such thoughts. This time I had set out a date for my own death, planned it into detail. She knew I was hiding something from her after an earlier word slip, so she had been pressuring me into telling. I finally gave in, because I didn’t want her to find out in the after math. But honestly, I wasn’t thinking clearly at all. So I came clean, hoping she would be able…I don’t know what I hoped for, just that she would slap those thoughts out of me. 

When she found out she got madder than I had ever seen her before. 

I went home that night, clueless of how much I had actually hurt her. It all seemed fine at first, I knew she was upset. But….I thought it was irritation, something we would talk about. 

(Take in mind despite how unserious it might seem written, I was really considering suicide. I was completely calm about it, not crying when thinking about it. It was just a matter about that I saw no point in living anymore. I had no motivation to do so. I was an idiot back then, and I needed a bitchslap. I couldn’t think quite clearly) 
The following day she didn’t respond to any of my messages. I could feel that something was wrong, for neither did Viking answer. 

I pleaded them to answer, for them to cease ignoring me. They did.

Angel sent me a long angry text, which the essence of it I think told me that she was tired of my manipulative nature, my childishness. That I had to grow up and stop pitying myself.
I panicked, I was so afraid. For she told me that she was not sure she if she could ever forgive me. She wasn’t sure if she would ever want to see me again, and told me to leave her alone. Instead of heading her, I sent her dozen of texts back, basically all just telling her how sorry I was. I didn’t stop until Viking told me to stay away from her. It was then I realized by doing this I was only doing more harm, and left her alone. Viking was there for me after this, he explained the situation in a bit better detail. The phone call could be summed up into two things. 

1: We were not best friends any more.
2: He wanted us to be best friends again, but wanted us to restart from the beginning. 

To be honest, I hardly remember what he said much more than this. I remember the pain I felt, how my fear of losing Viking as my friend increased tremendously. 
         After a few hours Viking had to go to sleep, I immediately contacted Pretty Boy.  I was still terribly sad and Pretty Boy helped me handle it that night. And as I filled him in with the details he didn’t know yet, he realized that there were pieces of the puzzle that didn’t quite fit his. He knew everyone was hiding something from him, and I wanted for him to know, he deserved it. 

That night I broke a promise I had made to both Angel and Viking; that I must not tell Pretty Boy of their affair. They would do it on their own, when they deemed the time was right. 

Not surprisingly, Pretty boy got angry when he heard it. For it would mean that all his closest friends had been keeping a huge secret from him for several months. Not one of us had told him, until now. 

I spent days, just reading Angel’s text over and over again. Trying to understand what went wrong. I did this until my brother convinced me to remove everything I had of her. And so I did. It was the best choice then.
Days passed and I stayed away from Angel as much as possible. I once sent a letter to Angel by a friend, giving her a more formal “Please, Forgive Me” 

During these days Viking were of great support for me, but I clung too much to him. He wanted a complete restart, while I wanted things to just go back to normal. (Partly because of semi-selfish reason such as I needed his support during these times, partly because I didn’t believe it to be possible to do a restart. (I still don’t)) My clinging however resulted in me just pushing him away further. Now I am [REDACTED_NAME] even sure if he would call me a friend of his. 

He wants space and I hope he feels like I’m giving it. Although as I write this I can’t help but feel that he watches over me. Just that…if something was to happen to me. He would be there; despite our recent fallings. 

Present day, me: 
A lot of time has passed since Angel broke of all her contact from me; it’s been about three months since it happened. Since then I’ve slowly come to control my sorrow. 

I no longer have any close friends; oh I got plenty of friends, but none to call close. None that I feel understand me, or truly cares for me as much as themselves or not more. I got Indian Boy though as something in-between. He’s my first choice of who to turn to when  troubled. 

Viking: 
I feel nothing but contempt from him when we meet anymore. No more love, no more nice feelings. But I can’t call it hate, no. It is just anger, I’m pretty sure that is all there is to it. I don’t know, he refuses to talk this out with me anymore. 
He isn’t friendly in any way to me; it is like our previous friendship never existed. He’s even a bit hostile when I meet him. Often I feel him being a bit rude and slightly mean to me. 
Although I do believe things look grim between us, despite the fact that we are farther away from each other than ever. I believe we will one day be friends again, the best friends. I am [REDACTED_NAME] where this belief stems from. That was…until recently however…
A couple of days ago, I asked him if he was mad at me. I wanted to know why he was acting like a jerk when he always used to be so caring and why he ignored my latest texts. He’s currently in Australia and will return in two weeks I had originally planned to wait until he returned but during his vacation he annoyed. I had since long back created a FB group for our chat and as a sign of respect (since he was the “leader” after all) I made him and me admin. But…he removed my admin status from the chat. 

I told him to reinstate my admin status and after he flat out refused to do so I  asked him if he was mad at me. The conversation lead as following.
Me-“Are you mad at me?” 
“I guess I am.”
Me – “What have I done?”
“A lot of things, you know.
Me-“Lately?”
“Don’t know.” 
Me- “I don’t know what to say, in fear of saying something wrong. You are surely tired of these discussions. SO! I will leave you to your vacation! :3 WILL YOU GET ME PICTURES OF KANGAROOS FOR ME?!

No answer

Me -“Urgh…did I say anything wrong? Is it too much to expect an answer normally?”
“Maybe it is, we will see. I can’t handle this right now, its 2 am for fucks sake.” (2am for him)
“That is chill, you can set the pace however you want. *jokingly* BUT I WANT PICTURES OF KANGAROOS! Awh well. Nighty! 
No answer

Will he ever care for me again? More than three months has passed and we hardly speak at all. Will he ever stop being angry on me? What more can I do?


Angel: 
Angel’s eyes however…Whenever I find Angel to lock her eyes on me, all I see is a cold stare. An ice cold stare, like she wish for me to disappear, to die. I believe if I told anyone of this, I would her that I am [REDACTED_NAME] imagining it. Whenever I’ve tried to reinstate contact with her she has told me she wants nothing to do with me, and end with threat if I ever hurt Viking again she will hurt me more than anyone has ever done before. 

Random note: Angel is suffering from the condition Asperger’s. 

Pretty Boy: 
Now days Pretty boy receives regular counseling from a therapist (though I do believe he did that before too), and is regularly taking anti-depressives and sleep pills. He advices me to do the same. Apparently his therapist believes him also, like Angel suffers from Asperger’s. 

I rejected his recommendation of the use of drugs, I’m fine. Though I believe I will take up counseling.

And that’s the full of it Reddit. Thank you for spending time to read this, just anyone reading this makes me feel a lot better.  Reddit, here I am, confused and not knowing what I shall do. 

I know I need to move on. But how do I move on? What do I need to do? 
Am I as horrible as Viking and Angel believe I am? I fear I might have some Mental Disorder or worse, for I don’t understand entirely what I’ve done wrong. I don’t understand how that one sentence made Viking and Angel, both so caring to suddenly hate me. 

I know I’m biased, but I’ve tried to keep it as neutral as possible. Sorry for the long post, I hope I made it an easy reading at least. This might be the wrong subreddit, but I’m rather new here and hope I posted it on the right one.

Only after we stopped talking, and I told my friends they finally had the courage to tell me that they hated him from day 1 because of how much of a know it all he was and that no one in the game likes him.

1fpm7sw,1727318571.0,2024-09-26 02:42:51,self,"My GF cheated on me, and all my friends knew. ","I met my girlfriend through my best mate. (Let's call him Dave.) He introduced me to his friend group, and I became part of it, my now ex girlfriend, (let's call her Emma) was also part of this group. There were 8 people in the group all together. 

We were friends for a while, I liked her, and I found out she liked me, asked her out, she said yes, and eventually we made it official. 

We were together for about 2, nearly 3 years, and I was honestly the happiest I've ever been. I thought we were perfect, we never argued, and overall, the relationship was great. Well, I thought it was.

I was so happy, and In my mind, she was ""The one"". I'd be thinking about it for a while, but I decided I was going to propose on our 3 year anniversary. I told Dave, and he was really happy for me. I wanted to arrange something romantic, like on the beach, or something you see on YouTube of these perfect proposals, I wanted it to be something we remembered forever. I wanted all of my friends help to arrange everything, so i arranged to see them all (Excluding my GF) and I told them I was planning to propose. 

I was expecting the excitement and happiness that Dave showed when I told him, but they all kinda looked at each other silently. I knew they were hiding something, it was obvious. So I asked what it was, and they all said it was nothing and then tried to pretend they were happy for me. But I asked them again, and one of the girls in the group just shouting out that Emma had been actively sleeping with a guy in the group (Let's call him Mike.) Since we started dating. They were all giggling between each other like it was some sort of joke, which, I thought it was to start with. Some really, stupid, unfunny joke. I kinda laughed it off, but when I looked at Mike, he said just said ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME]."" And I could tell he wasn't joking. 

After a minute, it dawned on me that it was real, and not a joke. I stormed out, if I stayed in there any longer, I would have caused a scene. 

Dave followed me out and told me he had no clue, and I genuinely believe him. I still believe him now, he seemed just as surprised as I was. 

He let me hide out at his place for a while, just so I could process everything and keep away from everyone. 

When Emma found out I knew, she started blowing up my phone. She even turned up at the house and Dave said he hadn't seen me and sent her away. 

Dave told me he was gonna see them all again and see what actually happened, so he did. And he told me that Emma started sleeping with Mike 3 months into our relationship, and it was something that happened quite often. Multiple times a month, the whole time we were together. And she told all her girl friends in the group, and eventually everyone knew except me and Dave. And no one told me, no one cared that she was cheating on me for 2 years. 

The only they told me is because I was going to propose to Emma. If I didn't plan that, I still wouldn't know. I thought these people were my friends, I was so close to them, they were basically family. I spent most of my time outside of work with them. 

Anyway, her and Mike are together now, and they're all still friends. I still see their social media stories of them all hanging out, and they even tag me in them sometimes, probably just to rub it in my face. I should probably block them all, but I don't want them to know they're pissing me off. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] no longer friends with them, and Dave also cut them all off because of what they did. 

So I lost who I thought was going to be my wife, but I gained a friend for life I guess. 

It sucks, it's been months since this happened, and it still hurts. I still wanna cry so bad, but I've got to keep the no cry streak going lol. When will I actually get over this? Anyone able to speak from experience? 

Sorry if it's hard to read or seems unbelievable, it honestly sounds like one of them sad movie plots. ",23006

This made me realize something that feels obvious and surprising at the same time, that since I don't want children, I probably just shouldn't be having sex at all...?

My ex was super against having kids, had an IUD, and was very pro-choice and not against having an abortion if it came to that. But even with all that... there's a chance of pregnancy, and a chance emotions change and a child is born. But I guess it's more arguably worth it in that case, depending on how badly you want intercourse.

My current gf has no birth control, and eapecially with her saying this, I don't feel comfortable banking on a condom that my life won't end up massively changed in an unplanned way. I could get a vasectomy, but it's a more intense commitment, maybe one day in the future I'd like kids. And I guess even with that it could fail in some cases.

1gltmej,1730994776.0,2024-11-07 15:52:56,self,Democrats: Identity politics are destroying you,"
I am [REDACTED_NAME] this as a democrat to other democrats: identity politics are dooming the party. It is not only alienating people who might vote for you by demonizing them for their opinions, or canceling them for some tweet they made ten years ago, but you are also ignoring the shifting political landscape of America. 

Believe it or not but MAGA has become increasingly more diverse and accepting of others, even if equality might not necessarily be equal or that racism, sexism and homophobia hasn't dissipated, it has grown in diversity and that's a fact.

13% of black voters went for Trump and 20% of black men voted Trump, 45% of latinos went for Trump,  and 52% of white woman went Trump. 42% of Gen Z voted for Trump. That is all in despite of democrats insistence that MAGA is full of the most misogynistic, racist, homophobic bunch around. And while MAGA might be all those things to some degree there are many who look past it for their own reasons. Even in the LGBTQ community there has been increasingly growing Trump support.

Being latino or an immigrant in general does not mean you are more accepting of illegal immigration or migrants in general. And lumping them into that group is working against you, focus on what they want as legally immigrated working Americans. Illegals can't vote, Americans can.

Democrats can't keep relying on these communities to vote for them anymore if they keep treating them as another check on a list of historically reliable voters; they have to approach them as individuals with individual needs rather than just minorities. 

Democrats need to get back white male voters. Democrats have utterly failed here and overlooked a massive problem with a hostility towards white men, which alienates them and turns them to the individuals like Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, and Andrew Tate. You have to understand that men are also trying to navigate an increasingly more diverse world, which is harder for them to find a place in and find healthy role models. If you keep telling men that they are the root of all evil, that they hate woman, that they are the privileged, those men are not going to suddenly change their ways if you don't empathize with them at all, don't provide them with some sense of empowerment, don't provide healthy role models, and shun them because they didn't agree with you. These men will turn to individuals who will provide them a sense of empowerment even if that is toxic, because at least they will have been given a purpose and identity. Democrats need a better more inclusive strategy for white men and frankly men in general. Remember bears don't vote, men do.

Democrats are wondering where their 15 million votes went that got Biden elected last time, well this is where they went. You may be mad at these people for voting for Trump, but if you continue to alienate them and act like they should vote democrat simply because you have been pandering to them for decades you will lose again. 

Policy matters, not race, gender, or sexual orientation.

Change now.

P.S. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] saying that republicans don't engage in dirty identity politics, but they have done a great job a gathering up all those who have gotten fed up with the democrats identity politics and lack of focus on the issues of the average citizens. Democrats have had a serious issue in forcing people of differing opinions out rather than just accepting that not everyone has the same opinion. You lost people during the George Floyd protests when people were saying maybe it's not cool to burn cities down and accept looting as a norm, and you called them racist and white privileged. You lost people during #MeToo when some said maybe it's not ok to label all men as sexist, and ignore their feelings, while giving them no healthy mechanisms of coping. You lost people when you didn't back Bernie Sanders who was the clearly more popular candidate, and you then called men who wanted Sanders sexist. You lost latinos because you assumed they were all cool with migrants because they come from the same place anyways. You lost latinos because you ignored them as a working class and saw them only as immigrants. You lost woman because the economy still matters to them. ",10548
1j072vd,1740747584.0,2025-02-28 12:59:44,self,"People with BPD should fix themselves first before going to dating market, your partner isn’t your unpaid psychiatrist","Read some insight about what happened to partners of people with BPD and their caregivers in this
[Harvard systematic review literature.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/s/ejrnoeXKrJ)

I am 32M, but let’s cut the bullshit, dating a woman with Borderline Personality Disorder is emotional self-harm. I wasted four years (2[REDACTED_PHONE]) trying to “fix” one, and here’s the raw truth nobody wants to admit, BPD isn’t just a disorder it’s a license to manipulate.

She weaponized vulnerability like a pro. Sweet? Intelligent? Sure, until her insecurities turned every conversation into a minefield. One wrong word and she’d shut down, sulking like a child. My empathy was her fuel. Every insecurity I confessed was later twisted into a blade to gut me with. I wasn’t a partner, I was a therapist, a punching bag, and an emotional hostage.  

The suicide threats? Classic BPD extortion. She’d dangle her life to keep me shackled to her bottomless pit of need. And when I couldn’t “fix” her fast enough, she monkey-branched to multiple married men. Not for love for supply. She treated people like utilities, one funded her, another stroked her ego, another absorbed her meltdowns. A fucking trauma dividend portfolio.  

Here’s the cold reality, BPD relationships are emotional Ponzi schemes. They take and take until you’re bankrupt, then move on to the next investor. Narcissists discard you, borderlines consume you. They exploit your pity to justify cruelty, all while Reddit coddles them with “uwu mental health” excuses.  

If you’re an empath, RUN. These relationships aren’t challenging, they’re parasitic. BPD abuse isn’t a flaw, it’s a feature. You can’t love someone out of a personality disorder, and sacrificing yourself won’t make them stable. It just makes you collateral damage.  

Downvote me, call me ableist, I don’t care. Save yourself the therapy bills and avoid this predatory neediness.  

To the “not all BPD” crowds:
Congrats if yours is medicated and self-aware. But the disorder itself thrives on instability. Defending it is like saying “not all landmines.” Some just haven’t exploded yet.



EDIT:

Leaving wasn’t an option. Every time I tried, she’d sprint into traffic, threaten to jump in front of trains, or slice her wrists for show (once even doing it for real, though not deep and wide enough to finish the job), I assure you it's scary.

The only way I escaped was by nuking both our reputations while I was away. I leaked proof of her affairs with married men, screenshots of her verbally abusing me, and bombarded her with daily messages for two weeks straight, not threats, just cold, blunt truths “You’re the problem. Fix yourself or rot.”

Eventually, she realized I had zero empathy left. Now I’m just the bad guy yelling ""SHAME"" at her face. Read some of [her behaviors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/s/GdRoS1idgf)

EDIT 2:

I’ve seen all the takes in the comment section, people with diagnosed BPD, empaths, haters, victims, even predators specialized in BPDs women.

Why don’t you all just… hug it out? Assuming you can tolerate a “long-term” hug without ""splitting"" and imploding.  

As for me, I’m out from this league.

EDIT 3:

I've outlined the risks of untreated BPD in relationships. So, instead of gaslighting and getting defensive in the comments, like my ex did, how about those of you with BPD share your symptoms from when you were undiagnosed and untreated?

That way, the rest of us can make informed choices and run like hell at the first sign to [save ourselves.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/s/0YGsZZpQxt) :)

FYI:

I have no animosity toward people with bipolar, HPD, ADHD, ASPD, schizoid, NPD, or any of those personality variations. A bit tedious, perhaps, but nothing a graceful retreat can't fix. It's the BPD that's earned my undivided attention. You can read my personal opinion about the differences between [NPD ex and BPD ex.](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/s/ePbgRmLIgh)",5898
16f1a0,1357958785.0,2013-01-12 02:46:25,self,"Living with PTSD that started at birth and  hit me again in highschool at 15...
My whole life story","Hello Reddit...
I apologize for my lack of punctuation in advance..
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a slump today and wanted to type out my story to whoever happens to read this. When I was just a chile 2-3 I lived with my father and my mother... He was a horrible man and took advantage of her she was 10 years younger at the time they met. I don't know how their relationship was in the beginning anyway he was scum... Drunk all the time high on whatever he he avoided paying taxs... anyway he started beating my mom she injured her back and ended up with a herniated disc in her back she couldn't work he would treat her like a dog I can't say for sure how long before I was born but I know It went on for a while.

When I was born into this world which today I question If I even wish I was he was bad he would beat on her try to have sex/makeout with her touch her all kinds of things In front of me... He abused me physically and physiologically I can't say exactly for sure what happened but I remember I was In a highchair maybe just 2 years old he pulled his pants down and showed me his ass and said ""Your daddy is a pervert"" around the same age I opened the fridge one time and he threw me on the floor for it...        One thing I will never forget is the day when he made me throw my Mothers keys behind the couch and made her get them to hurt her back... he would kick our cats and such.. I lived in hell for my first few years on this earth.

My Mom tried so hard to get me out of there she did everything she could but he would beat her more threaten her and of course lied about everything he ever had done after my mom spent all her money and worked her ass off she finally escaped and took me across the country to WA where I am [REDACTED_NAME]. 

Now I could be wrong about this but I think we ended up having to move back to him for a few years with all the court stuff he said my mom was crazy and he was god all mighty long story sort of short here he got off the hook nothing happened hes a free man with a new wife and 4 new kids... 

Now I had so many problems growing up It probably was when I started school I had anger problems I was crude had a horrible time keeping friends back talked to teacher had no respect for them if they weren't ""nice"" to me I was in trouble constantly I got suspended for 2 weeks In 5th grade.

I was seeing a therapist throughout that whole time now during that time my father demanded visits with me they were supervised at least but every week when he would visit I would have night terrors grind my teeth and get no sleep It was a nightmare In It's self.

They stopped when I was about 8 or 9... that sort of sums up my childhood.

Things got better It was in the past obviously it was still a problem middle was just as bad as elementary but in comparison It was better I guess... not really.. in 2010 I was diagnosed with PTSD from what my dad had done and the schools wouldn't listen I was still in the office every god damn day.

This Is when things got bad again I made my fair share of mistakes in middle school I was oblivious to the repercussions of my actions on the final day of 8th grade I had pissed off a kid with anger problems a week prior I told the principle he actually ignored me blatantly and said ""No nothing will happen"" (the kid said he would kick my ass) so back to the last day everyone was in the gym the kid was string me down with his friend I knew he was mad.... He started following me I was looking for help but no one was listening It was loud I saw the back exit and started to run before I could get out.... It was too late.

He picked me up and used me to push open the door lifted me and threw me on the sidewalk (He weighed about 250 pounds I was a skinny 110 then) I couldent breath I was stunned and my back and head and neck were all hurt... I tried to get up but stumbled down the janitor told him to go away fucking dumb ass thought we were ""fighting"" anyway his fuckhead mom was in the parking lot and took him away I called 911 and so did some other people I got hauled off on a backboard in front of half the school.

Now that wasn't the worst I was pretty shaken after that but I recover somewhat.

After that In the summer I got caught up in the wrong crowd of people started smoking weed they were always fighting I was always downtown or other where they lived in the projects... they were the definition of welfare I met them through a girl friend of mine she was in a relationship with one of them and so I was with them almost daily.

One day I told the girls boyfriend she had cheated on him which he had and that was a mistake I think about so much.
I was also dating her friend and she dumped me we got into a fight she made fun of the abuse my dad did to me.. Now was this right of her? No.. But I responded with ""I hope your step dad rapes you so and you get made fun of so you know how it feels"" clearly not smart... now by that time the girl who had introduced me to them hated me for what I told her BF my ex gf hated me but I still thought her boyfriend was my best friend.

One day I get a call from him ""Hey come hangout at the park next to my house"" nothing out of the ordinary I did my mom was out of town I took the city bus downtown then up to his side of town. He was with someone I did not know but I didn't think much of it I walked up to them and he says ""What's up?"" I said I had to pee.... He say ""sorry I have to do this"" the next thing I know he has me in a choke hold and in falling to the ground I try and brace myself and that's when my right collar bone snapped I was unaware for a bit he held me down.. while he friend kicked me in the back at least 10 times... I screamed.. no one in the whole fucking park even noticed I was being attacked he finally let go and I jumped up and tried to explain myself desperately.
He though I had just said that to her out of the blue not knowing the context of the situation at all. They continued to follow me as I backed away after I explained he stopped and told his friend to as well... I was shocked my pulse must have been 150 as the adrenalin went away I felt a horrible pain in my shoulder and my back hurt I didn't know what the hell just had occurred all I knew was something was broken. I walked back to the bus stop in agony waited there took the bus downtown waited for that bus got home about an hour after being jumped realized I was injured bad I called 911 and then help came.

Broken collar bone spent the day in the hospital got lot's of vicodin...
Then went home I think later that day..

The next week was indescribable I was In so much pain I could hardly move I didn't eat I was afraid of someone breaking into my house I was afraid of the world that day of being attacked changed me forever the trauma of that incident will be in my bones and my body forever PTSD was no longer a diagnoses It was a full on reality nothing was safe every sound shook me every person my age scared me I hardly left my home my arm was immobile... 

I never knew life could be such a nightmare...
one week later school starts first day of high school I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a sling I people who had beef with me from middle school were shoving me pushing me all kinds of things and the girl who introduced me all of this was one of those people. She screamed all kinds of names at me cheap insults every time she saw me I never would ever wish that week of my life on anyone.
I tried to get help from the school they did absolutely nothing    NOTHING AT ALL I was injured scared and being beat up and they did not care one tiny bit.

One day at lunch this kids brother who told him too had 6 juniors walk up to me at lunch and they all told me how they were going to ""kick my ass again"" That was about 5 days into that school year I got up walked away and saw a group of random people walking towards me I dident even know them but I got so freaked out knew the school wouldent help and I was on my own. I left I walked about 5 miles downtown and called my mom and explained what happened and ended up home.

Now on top of everything a week later after I decided I couldn't keep going to school I woke up noticing a sharp pain in my side yup appendicitis, appendectomy, more vicodin 5 days in the hospital....

I spent 4 months at home smoking weed (had a green card) not able to leave due to pain and fear life was never the same everyone was a threat this actually went on for 9 months I never went back to freshmen year I was on all kinds of meds I was seeing a therapist again nothing was helping anyway after a year of nothing but sitting in my room I finally got out a little. I had tried to go to school in the end but I couldn't even walk in the building without being afraid. 

By the next summer I joined this program called GRUB It was this farm it was part of the school and you got credits and money anyway that helped a little and I was feeling ready to go back to school because of that program but about 4 days before school was to start I got told I was not going to be accepted into the school year... they let every other person in but me.


So to the present day I go to 3 periods of school failing all my classes on lots of pills cut myself a while back got hooked on Vicodin for a few months got addicted went through withdrawal and live every day in fear PTSD is horrible It makes the world seem like a war to me i can hardly be at school I worry someones going to jump me or kill me or stab me or the worst will happen people still fuck with me.. 
Oh and as soon as my collar bone was healed I trained in Krav Maga and Jeet Kun Do self defense for about a year did p90x twice worked my ass off and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] so afraid I really want to leave this world sometimes the school continues to fuck me as well as the students.

I'll never be the same but I guess it happened for a reason it made me who I am I have lot's of undetermined health problems going on at the moment as well.. I hope one day I will be free again and I dream of the past when life was a gift If anyone reads this thanks.

My dad was out on a client entertainment and I was home with my mother and younger sister, living in a Baltimore suburb area at that time. Sister had already gone to bed and I was watching a movie with my mom on one of the cable movie channels (TNT, TBS, etc). This was the era before DirectTV, Fios, and all that. Everyone just got 100 channels or so on their TV, had memorized the channel numbers, and would enter the number then press enter on their remote to flip channels. 

Anyway, it was about 9pm or so at night and my mom and I were watching a movie, I don't remember which one it was. But all of a sudden a woman took her top off and revealed uncensored breasts. They looked to be about 34 D's, but that's all I can remember. My mother was shocked wondering how the channel allowed uncensored tits on cable TV. She scrambled around and flipped the channel off, then called my aunt to get her take on the matter. When my dad came home she told him I had seen boobs on the TV.

Nearly 30 years later and I can report that seeing uncensored tits on TV when I was 6 had no negative impact on my life. I grew up to become a good student, get a good job, marry a wonderful woman, and now have a beautiful daughter. The breasts I saw on TV that day did not turn me into a serial killer, rapist, or other unsavory character. But who knows, maybe I was just one of the lucky ones.

We have been dating for three years and are 25 y/o adults! But she was making notes of conversation topics like a kid with a crush.

I was so touched by this level of effort I almost teared up. I feel so loved.",42700
1gl2c9f,1730910146.0,2024-11-06 16:22:26,self,The Democratic Party has nobody to blame but themselves. This is what the country deserves.,"I voted for Harris, but at this point I believe that a second Trump administration is exactly what this country fucking deserves, if for no other reason than to emphasize that the Democratic Party—to which I've lent my support for my entire voting career—is a pathetic disgrace of an institution that no longer deserves endorsement solely on the basis of their not being Republican.

The reason the GOP has successfully been attacking the Dems for being out-of-touch is very simple: it's fucking true. Election after election they have failed to give voters electable candidates. The only popular Democratic President since Bill Clinton was Obama, and he wasn’t even the candidate the Party wanted! It was supposed to be Hillary, and we all saw what a disaster that idea ended up being in 2016. Biden barely won in 2020, only because of COVID, and proceeded to deteriorate while leading an incredibly unpopular administration that domestically oversaw a hike in prices, and on the world stage oversaw the escalation of two major conflicts. Was it all Biden’s fault? Of course not, but it doesn't fucking matter in the court of public opinion.

Then, after Biden dropped out way too fucking late, with no actual input from any voters the Dems elevated zero-charisma Kamala Harris and expect people to mobilize for her en masse? The vice president inextricably linked to the aforementioned wildly unpopular administration? In what world did the Democrats expect that to be a winning strategy?

The fact of the matter is that Americans were never going to elect a female president, especially not a nonwhite one. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] saying that’s okay, but what I am [REDACTED_NAME] is that it's true. The Democrats were so blind to the reality of the ideological makeup of the electorate that they chose Harris, who was an abject failure in the 2020 Democratic primary, as the person they thought would beat Donald Trump. What absolute fucking IDIOTS.

They also have spent over a decade alienating white men, the biggest fucking voting bloc in America. They surrendered them to they sympathetic arms of Republicans without so much as a fight. Of course men deserve criticism for their behavior and privilege, but the realpolitik of the situation is that you can’t broad-stroke demonize and guilt-trip an entire demographic and then expect them to support you in elections. That was never going to work.

Not only did they alienate those men, they also condescended to and took for granted women and minorities. They looked down on and treated with disdain the huge bloc of religious voters. You can be as principled and technically correct as you want, but it doesn't fucking matter when your messaging alienates damn near everybody. That's what the Dems never understood, can’t understand now, and in all likelihood never will understand.

And guess what’s going to happen now? Trump is going to appoint nobody but loyalists, he's going to consolidate power and go mostly unchecked with a Republican-domiated Senate, House, and Supreme Court. Probably Ukraine falls, either through an outright loss in battle or through a shitty deal brokered by the notoriously Russian-sympathetic incoming administration. Say hello to an empowered Putin, who might have his eye on Poland, Moldova, Finland, etc. Probably things will continue to get worse in the Middle East. At the very least, if Trump escalates the trade war with China you can count on China growing closer with Russia, North Korea, and Iran. God help us all.

But do you know what else will happen? The economy will recover. Probably crime goes down. What’s that, you say? If the economy does improve it will only be because of policies implemented in the Biden Administration that have slowly made an impact? Crime rates aren't as high as people say they are? Well, you’re right, but it doesn't fucking matter that you're right because the average voter doesn't care. Condemn that voter all you want, blame whatever system you want, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter that you understand and they don't.

And while the standard of living is improving, even marginally, what do you think Democrats will be doing? Since they are terminally incapable of reading the room, they’ll continue to futility crusade again Trump, making him into even more of a sympathetic martyr. They’ll double down on the identity politics that have alienated more and more people each election. Academics will continue to moronically squirm in their silos of bullshit critical theory. All the while they'll be growing more and more out-of-touch with voters, and I frankly wouldn't be surprised if we never see another Democratic president. Maybe over the course of the next 20 or 30 years we will see the gradual rise of an economically conservative socially liberal third party that eventually takes the place of the modern Democratic party. But barring that near-impossible feat, I really think that we’ve spent the past year watching the great progressive experiment fail before our very eyes. And the Democrats have absolutely nobody to blame but themselves. Fuck it all.

  
EDIT: I'm [REDACTED_NAME] two comments I made, just to clarify in case anybody actually cares:

1. On my comment about female presidents:

I've been catching a lot of flack for the comments I made about Harris’ gender and race, so I’ll just say this here:

You're right that any sexist/racist would never have voted for her anyway. But subtle misogyny was one of the many popular appeals to grievance in Trump’s campaign even before Harris took over the candidacy and sexist language came closer to the forefront. The DNC should have been smart enough to see that, and then make the realization that whatever perceived draw from progressive voters a female candidate might get would inevitably be outweight by the risk of giving Trump more ammunition to rile up the men that make up such an important part of the base. It was a bad tactical move that didn't pay off, not even among female voters. It didn't work in 2016 and it didn't work this year, even though they put a lot less emphasis on it.

2. On my comment about white men:

I've been flamed a lot for this line, so I’ll just clarify once:

I think it was important to have the conversation about male privilege and bad behavior. I think it was important to talk about misbalanced power dynamics and the prevalence of sexual assault and violence. I think we should keep all these things in mind.

I do not think that you should use these issues to condemn men as a whole, because that's the kind of attitude that drives non-shitty men further away from the Democratic party, which is the opposite of what any political party should be trying to do. I've seen it happen to friends—from 2016 to 2024 so many men moved right because of the dumbass overcorrection from #MeToo to #AllMenAreTrash. Zero nuance. A justifiable call for accountability became hyperpoliticized into hate and alienation. Now Dems are paying for it.





To restate my previous concluding statement, fuck it all.

1fur2zx,1727903181.0,2024-10-02 21:06:21,self,How do I tell a girl my biggest insecurity before we have sex,"So I recently started going out with an amazing girl. We hit it off immediately. Bear in mind I have alot if trouble with dating due to my situation-

My situation in question is this:

When I was a newborn, i had a severe case of hypospadias, which is basically where the opening of the urethra in low on the shaft of the penis. But in combination with this condition, in the womb my testicles had fused with my penis causing my parents to have to make a decision for me as a newborn that I would have never made myself. They chose to have my testicles removed versus having me go through multiple stages of dangerous surgeries when I was very young. Due to the hormonal imbalance of this before getting prescribed testosterone as a teen, my penis is well below average (~2.8in) and it makes me feel like less of a man. 

So my dilemma is this:
How do i explain this to this amazing woman im going out with in a way that doesn’t make me sound wildly insecure about it(which I am), because in my head as soon as I tell her, she will want nothing to do with me. 

One of my biggest dreams in life is to have a family and be a father, but I know that it will never be MY child(by blood), which I have accepted, but explaining this to someone new hurts to even think about. I dont want to be looked at as less of a man, or as someone who cant provide her with what she wants. 

EDIT1: i just wanted to say thank you to every single person who has commented, dmed, or reached out. The immense support im feeling helps me more than you know. Im sorry i havent been able to respond to every message(kinda hard when theres 1500+), but if you really want to reach out, or are a parent who needs advice with their kid(ive had a couple reach out) my dms are open. I will update this thread once I tell her. 

EDIT2: Well, i told her. Needless to say, it went amazing. I guess in my head i had a bad idea of what would happen because of the way my last gf reacted. This woman comforted me, told me it wasnt an issue at all and we would work through it, and then messaged me after i left saying how much it meant to her that i told her and trusted her like that. I think now i can start planning on asking her to be my girlfriend. Thank you everyone for the support and kind words. I feel completely loved by complete internet strangers. Everything happens for a reason. ",9473

But I can't help but feel shitty about it when the same family members who are totally supportive of her were abusive to me about the exact same situation.  My dad told me I would go to hell, that he would put me up for adoption if I didn't stop being gay, that gays aren't welcome in our family.  My cousins were all rude af about it and openly mocked me for it for years.  But now that my cousin's daughter came out they all completely flipped the script and they're all done being homophobic evidently, even my dad.  I've always been the black sheep of the family for a variety of reasons but it makes me wonder why they are supportive of her but not of me.  They could at least apologize for all the shit they put me through if they really have changed their minds.  Am I being unreasonable?

1jesqbb,1742375042.0,2025-03-19 09:04:02,self,Just realized I’ve been eating likely only ~1000 cals a day for most of my life,"A bit ridiculous it took me this long to catch on, I know. I’ve always just not been very hungry, and food for a long time was just something I handled at the end of the day with an average sized meal the majority of my adult life. As a kid, in my first household I snuck a lot of food to my dog since I was often averse to my only option, and then in the second household I just ate whatever from the pantry at night. 

I’ve been into sports a long time, mainly swimming. But lately I’ve decided to get more into weightlifting, and over the past year I’ve been really trying to focus on slowly improving in basic self-care stuff. Taking daily meds, brushing teeth everyday, etc. 

Logging each and every thing I ate was something I’ve meant to do for a while, as I understand a big part of my exercise routine I’m missing is eating enough. But since I already knew it was low to start out, I first have been slowly upping my intake as much as I can, even past discomfort sometimes. 

Cue me finally deciding to add up my food for the day out of curiosity- I felt proud I had ate so much more than normal, and thought maybe I would have met the actual recommended amount. 

My “a lot” was fucking 1350… Oof. 

Not looking forward to how uncomfortable it’s probably going to be to push it even more than I did today. Nor am I sure how to do so. If anyone knows how to make oneself more hungry, I’m all ears. ",215
1fdtvv0,1726004868.0,2024-09-10 21:47:48,self,I’m the kid of one of those traveling rv families online and I hate them for it every day ,"My parents decided when I was only around seven years old, far to young to get an opinion on anything to pack us up and move into an rv to travel around the us. My dad works online and my mom makes content online, she’s not huge by any means but big enough that we get recognized sometimes and big enough that i’ve had a camera shoved in my face for as long as I can remember. For my privacy’s sake I won’t say anything else on that and i’m using a throwaway account because i’ve gotten enough attention already and i’m sick of it. 

I sleep in a tiny bunk bed that I outgrew years ago and the other bunk is the only space I have to put anything I own. I don’t even have a room just a curtain and thank god i’m an only child or else I would have to share the small space I have already. I was homeschooled for most of my education and then switched to online school at my own insistence for high school. I’m an 18 year old girl, I don’t have a single friend in person because the longest i’ve ever stayed anywhere is a month. I don’t have a job and no way to get one because of not being stationary unless I find one online which also mean I have no way to move out and get away from them. 

I’ve had conversations with them about all of this countless times and they are so delusional and genuinely believe that “a nomadic existence is the best way to live” so why would I never need anything else. I hate them for treating me like some pet they can just drag along in their plans rather than their child. I hate traveling, I don’t like heat, I hate dealing with bugs, and i’m so sick of hiking. I can’t wait for the day that I finally figure out a way to get away from them with their mornings hikes and cameras in my face. I’ve traveled around the us yeah but god forbid I want to have a normal life, go the college or maybe even makes some friends? That’s asking to much. ",19884

Update: as of 11:45 the device is disabled.

I wanna thank everyone for your suggestions, I loved the diabolical, unhinged shit y'all crazy motherfuckers suggested, shit had me in stitches. 

I ended up combining a few different suggestions. I disassembled the device and took some of its internal pieces and pitched them off the balcony into the night. I don't live near nature before anyone shits themselves, and I don't think a few electrical parts are any worse for the concrete than the thousands of cigarettes butt's, broken glass shards, other litter, etc out there. 

The device no longer turns on. It has been reassembled. 

I had a lot of fun in this thread despite the people who came here just to be mad and the people who tried to literally kill me by trying to convince me to microwave it and the one guy who DMd me telling me to commit suicide. But in all seriousness, stuff like this is literally used in torture. The person I live with is abrasive, hostile, and impossible to reason with. It wasn't just them playing loud music. It was them playing the same 2 hour Playlist on repeat for up to 12 hours every day at a volume so loud that it overpowered my noise-canceling headphones. I tried to ask nicely multiple times, I got into screaming matches over this which I did not escalate, I called in noise complaints with the building and the police, and nothing came of it. 

I lost sleep. I couldn't play video games or watch movies or listen to music in my own home. I couldn't have company over. I had to stay away from my home even on days I was exhausted from work. When I was home I just kept getting angrier and angrier at the situation. I started to have high blood pressure and I was feeling irritable all the time. I was damaging my own hearing to try and drown it out. I was suffering migraines daily. As much as this thread was kind of a gag, this stuff was seriously damaging and that is not a joke. 

It's pretty clear most people have no idea and think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] dramatic as evidenced by people getting an attitude with me. Google auditory torture I guess if you think I am [REDACTED_NAME] the wrong here. 

I am [REDACTED_NAME] to move out soon, not that it is anyone's business. Just looking for places. A bunch of people who i have to assume are children with no knowledge of how the world works kept saying ""durr just move"" like there isn't a massive housing crisis going on. ",4557
1g32jbu,1728861470.0,2024-10-13 23:17:50,self,I saw my dad crying and I can't get it out of my head,"TLDR: My mom exploded and began throwing stuff on the floor in my sister's room. My dad was bend over against the wall crying and begging her to stop.

Today my (19M) younger sister and my mom had a fight about my sister's room. There were a lot of things in my sister's closet that weren't hers so she asked my mom if she could move them. She's asked this multiple times over a long period of time and everytime my mom didn't do it. Today my sister's asked again and my mom got irritated so she decided to ignore my sister and not talk to her. When my sister said to my father that it was kinda childish to act this way something in my mom snapped. She ran upstairs to her room without saying anything.

Later when my sister was in her room my mom stormed in and started throwing shit from the closet on the floor without saying anything. My sister was like ""wtf are you doing"" but my mom ignored her and kept violently throwing stuff to the ground. My sister got scared and started yelling and crying. 

Up until this point I didnt know that this was all happening so when I heard her crying I came to see what was up and I saw my father standing in the doorway with the door half closed. When I peaked into the room I saw my sister crying in the corner of the room and my mom just throwing stuff. 

I yelled something along the lines of ""wtf is happening"" and my mom just yelled at me to stay out of it. I told her to stop what she was doing and then everybody just started to yell at each other. Then when I looked over at my dad he was bend over against the wall crying his eyes out. He just yelled with the most defeated fucking voice I've ever heard: *""no no please stop! please please no!""* I hugged him from behind trying to get him up and move him to his bedroom but he refused to move and cried that I didn't get it and that it was all his fault because he couldn't talk??(I think he meant about his feelings)

This completely fucking broke me and at this point I was crying as well. Seeing my father like this, completely in panic and shock, it did something to me. I felt like I had to protect him because he emotionally just fell apart.

Now everything's cooled down a bit and it is all sorta fine but I still hear my dad's broken voice in my head. He just sounded so defeated and sad and his voice was like 2 octaves higher and shivering. When I tried to sleep just now I kept hearing his cries for my mom and sister to stop in my head over and over again and I don't know what to do.

Anyways I'll try to get some sleep now but if you guys want to know more I'll update tomorrow.

EDIT:

For all of the people supporting me, thanks! My intention with posting this was just to get some support. I didn't need anyone pointing fingers to my mom calling her all sorts of things. This post was not really about the fight, more about my father, so maybe I shouldn't have told the whole story. I don't think any less of my father or think he is weak. I know it's okay for man to cry, I do it as well. It just made me really sad to see my dad so sad and that is what I wanted to share.

To clear things up: my mom is not a substance abuser or anything like that and my dad didn't cheat on her (how the fuck does someone come up with that by reading the smallest story lol). My mom does probably have some mental problems though. Through my childhood I've always seen this. When she's mad she starts to ignore you, she can be really angry and the next moment she's happy again, when she's mad or sad everyone else will be to because of her actions, she brings you stuff when you don't ask for it but when you actually need something she's ""already doing so much for us"". 

I really love her but she's quite something. During dinner yesterday my mom told us she was very very sorry and that she didn't want to scare anyone. She said that when she entered my sister's room she didn't know my sister was in there so she started removing the stuff from the closet. I asked her why she didn't stop after hearing my sister telling her to stop, she said she didn't know.

After dinner I talked to my parents when my sister's went upstairs. I was softly crying again at this point because of all the thoughts going through my head. I said to my mom that this wasn't how normal people react to things and she agreed. I said that maybe it's for the better if she talked with maybe a psychologist and that there was no shame in that. She said that maybe that's a good idea. I told them that the reason I was crying was not because I was scared but, because I was sad to see my sister standing scared in the corner of her room, unable to do anything about it. I said that I hated that my mom did it to someone smaller and weaker then her because if she would have done it in my room I would have grabbed her and put her on the ground.

When I started to talk about my father crying I broke down again. I just heard his defeated voice over and over again in my head. He told me that there was a lot of miscommunication going on beforehand, between my mom and my dad, about who was going to clean the closet and when. So when my sister asked for it again something in my mom snapped.

If there is more confusion I I'll update you guys again, thanks for listening btw!

EDIT 2: 

I still see some people that think that I found it weird that my dad was crying. I want to say that I don't think less of him or that he is not a ""real man"" for crying. I just wanted to vent my heart out because I was really sad that he was so sad. I love him and my mom very much and I told my parents both after dinner.",7135

Tokyo Station

He has the stink of a foreigner/Chinese (two teen girls said this three times as I passed by them looking for someone)

On a Train

He's scary/dangerous. Don't look at him.  He'll kill you (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] straight-laced as they come)

He's American.  He's still Chinese though (after hearing me speak English)

Train Station

My wife (who's born and raised Japanese) and I approach two male train station staff.  She asks them a question, looks at me quizzically wondering why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the one asking, and answer her question.  I then ask them a question at the end and they just walk away and mutter to each other (what the hell is she doing with a foreigner.)

Tokyo Skytree

They come every damn year over and over

It's ok he's a foreigner (a teen to his friend when he sat down while half-asking if he could

Tokyo Disneyland

You shouldn't be here.  Get out of here (to my white Hispanic in-law, my sister also came)

Mt Takao

He has a huge backpack.  It's so lame.  I'd never wear that.  (Bought the backpack in Japan.  It's for my Japanese wife with rheumatoid arthritis and young daughter and me.)

How many pictures is she going to take?  She's taking another one!  (girl to guy about my sister taking pictures of the view on the train up to Mt Takao)

Foreigners are really a pain in the ass.   He ruined the vibe.  I don't know want to talk anymore.  We should've come earlier so we'd see fewer foreigners (after seeing me, various places)

He's pushing that little girl.  She looks Japanese.  Is that ok? (Im walking and holding hands with my daughter)

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the wrong way haha (a group taking up the entire path including my left side)

He's getting scared.  He'll start shaking soon (buying tickets at a machine and having a bit of trouble before our Japanese guide came looking like he was embarrassed to be with us.)

A word about our guide: My wife and child weren't on this trip to Mt Takao with us as they were visiting family.  Later our guide said I should've told them I had a Japanese wife and child as if that would've made us acceptable in his eyes.  And he did start treating us better after he found that out.  He seems like a decent guy, it's a shame he only saw us as decent after finding we had Japanese family and friends)

Hakone

What the hell is that Japanese man doing showing these foreigners around (about our guide, two young men a foot behind me at a ticket office)

There's foreigners here.  It's safe there's a Japanese man with them

Rest Stop on the Way Back

He's not Japanese.  Look at his eyes (a mom said this to her ten yr old)

Kamakura

Foreigners love to stand in the middle of the road (we were to the side in an alley)

Complaining about foreigners taking all the incense sticks at a shrine (we took two)

Bowing to me with clapped hands (thats a stereotypical Asian bow thet dont do) as I pass them on the street.  Yelling Korean at me (twice)
Thoughts: Visiting Japan has gotten much worse this year.  It's constantly being watched and policed and talked about and criticized and held to a higher standard than Japanese and feeling unwanted and Im imposing on their lives and the cause of whatever problem it is they're personally going through.  The people are seething underneath and it explodes in angry whispers.  Always whispers.  Apparently it's due to weakening yen, economy, low birth rate, China-Japan relations, poor communication skills, widespread media coverage of a few foreigners behaving badly.  

There are also cases where they've been nice, helping me pick up something Ive dropped, making small talk with a smile, hurrying to eat their food so my family could sit a little sooner.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] to concentrate on positive experiences and am still having fun but I am [REDACTED_NAME] feeling increasingly insecure out in public and emotionally exhausted

Update 1: 
6/[REDACTED_ADDRESS]ation, Ginza, Akihabara, Skytree

What's she doing with a foreigner.  He has to be chinese right.  But he can speak japanese.  Maybe he's Japanese American.  But he looks Chinese.  I guess with some women any one is ok.  She should be with Japanese man though.  Their daughter is speaking English and Japanese.  She should learn more Japanese. Now he's speaking English again.  Well maybe he's a nice guy.  There's bad japanese guys too.  (Two older women having a running conversation one table away in a tiny restaurant)

It smells (two teen girls with their dad when they see me)

It's lame with foreigners here (at a restaurant)
(After hearing me speak english.) He cant be chinese of course because he has facial hair so he's american.  Wow you know so much about them.  Well i guess you could say that

That's why I couldn't figure out what he was.  (After interacting with me then seeing my wife)

Hold me tighter.  He's so scary (my 70 year old dad and I walking)

(After i put on an american flag sticker on my backpack)

Look at him total giveaway, chinese.  Ah, he's american

Hes chinese right.  Ah wrong, american

There's another one.  Ah it's because japanese are too annoying he got the flag

So he's american. But he's still conniving to put that flag there

Thoughts: Reading everyone's comments has been really validating and perspective-shifting and helpful to me.  Thank you all for your support!  Only eleven more days to go this time in Hokkaido.  While I've had some incidents there in the past (family friend said Chinese bring pests with them, airport workers tried to figure out what I was for twenty or so minutes while I waited to enter the gate) hopefully there will be less incidents since there are fewer tourists and I'll be around my wife and her father more instead of on my own or with my extended family

Update 2: 
 
6/19 At the Airport, Hokkaido

He's a foreigner.  American.  But Chinese probably.  His wife's Japnese.  But theyre sometimes speaking English.  They should teach their daughter Japanese.  There are Japanese who travel overseas.  That's probably where they met.  We should talk later.  He might know Japanese.  (At a restaurant, the baggage handlers behind the staff at the ticket counter, on the airplane.  Pretty much same conversation.  After i started speaking more than a little japnese the men at the restaurant stopped talking about us.)

He's a foreigner.  I guess Japanese girls are that good.  Quiet, he might know some Japanese (group of Japanese boys)

You know from ancient times Japan's been in charge of China.  That's terrible you said that.  It's the Chinese again (At the airport restroom behind my back while I was peeing, his friend, then same guy again at the parking lot while I was walking with my father in law)

They're letting foreign children in now (after saying hi to a mom with her toddler when signing my child up for elementary school)

Thoughts: years ago they might more considerately say ""he has the look of a foreigner"" or ""we can't really tell can we"" but recently it's with contempt and ""he has the stink of a foreigner""

Update 3:

6/20 Tomita Farms

You know that guy he's not japanese hes chinese or american

This place is full of foreigners.  This country is over

Hey be nice to the foreigner.  This one knows Japanese and has manners (after another staff member must have said something)

6/21 Asahikawa, zoo

Leaving the seal exhibit, a man with teenaged kids said to them upon exiting and hearing me speak English ""japan is finished""

On the bus out, an old lady mustve been over 80 said to her companion after hearing me speak english that don't foreigners have their own zoos to go to?  Why are they coming to our country to our zoos?

Thoughts: for the most part, the last two days I spent it with my wife and her family as we went out so most I got were looks and hey he's alright he's with a Japanese wife and them trying to figure out how an Asian could speak english. As long as Im in visual distance of Japanese I know where they can connect us the most they show is civility and curiosity.  I do think more than Tokyo the staff is also more used to Asian travelers and in fact want then to come because i dont sense so much fatigue and from what i heard the zoo and tomita farms and elsewhere spent lots of money to lure foreign tourists and there were quite a few.

6/22
At a scenic view, bikers kept looking my way and made jokes among themselves but I couldn't make it out.

At a rest stop in a small town, one person saw I wasn't Japanese and talked about it then other groups overheard them talking then everyone was talking about the ""Chinese,"" ""how could she be with a Japanese,""  ""They're probably eating fried rice tonight,"" ""he's stretching and Japanese don't stretch in public,"" ""look at his face hes not Japanese.""  One group said it so loud my father-in-law overheard and muttered they were being rude and my wife looked at me finally understanding what I'd been telling her.

Final Update:

6/23-7/1

At a mall, a couple walking behind me said I couldn't be Japanese because my legs were short

At a children's playground, another kid said to her friend ""let's go there's a weird kid speaking English here.""

At a ramen shop, a woman with her boyfriend, both in late twenties, said my speaking English made her feel sick

At a sushi restaurant.  I was refilling hot tea for my wife and father in law and two Japanese young men were watching and said ""So he is considerate.  About this, anyway.""  And left.

At another children's playground, the kids were playing run away from the foreigner

At the airport, a father pointed out to his pre-teen son that I wasn't Japanese as they walked past and the son then scoped me out.  Then a group of male teens were again surprised that I wasn't Japanese and speaking English

At LAX, two Japanese men there for the anime expo said ""oh he's a foreigner"" when they noticed me.

Thoughts: for the most part, went out with my wife and father-in-law so didn't hear as many comments on a per meeting basis.  I did overhear them say to ""be considerate.  He's with Japanese. It can't be helped.""  I did hear the usual ""he's not Japanese, he's a foreigner, Chinese"" which I got accustomed to but it's the negative comments that got to me.  I think the only time I felt like things could turn to violence was at Mt Takao where the train we took down the mountain was full of rowdy men who had earlier criticized me for not being able to work the ticket machine faster.  

My takeaway from this experience is that the Japanese people are curious, they are also going to talk shit if they feel they can get away with it but I can't live my life by what people are thinking.  I can just try to be positive, hopefully that will help them change, and do what I need to do.  But also not to repeatedly put myself in a situation with people where I can't thrive.  Thanks to everyone for your support.  It really helped support me so I could figure how to deal with this incredible stress.",12060
1fup7qt,1727898432.0,2024-10-02 19:47:12,self,"I finally know why my parents hated me my whole life, it only took me 28 years","TW for mentions of Child abuse

I grew up in an abusive household, I was the black sheep of the family and from a very young age I knew that my parents saw me differently from my sister. My sister was spoiled in comparison. Every single bad thing that happened in that house was always my fault in my parent's eyes. My father would constantly tell me out of the blue how much happier he'd be if he didn't have kids, how I make his life miserable, that I am a literal demon and not human, and all the ways he wanted to physically hurt me. That's not even the half of it. He would beat me to the point I couldn't walk properly, but  it wasn't as common as the emotional abuse. My mother on the other hand just watched and would pretend like nothing happened.

Anyway, a few months ago I was feeling very lost in my life, I have a lot of mental health issues from the childhood trauma and didn't know what to do with myself. I decided to call my aunt who has lived overseas for almost 30 years now, I asked her how she managed to move abroad and she said in her words  
""I didn't plan it, the plane tickets didn't belong to me. They were your fathers tickets but...you should ask him why he didn't go, it's a funny story""

My heart dropped immediately. It's like a lifetime of mystery suddenly made sense. My Aunt has lived overseas for almost the same amount of time I've been alive. My father has wanted to live abroad for his whole life. My mother was super religious at the time so an abortion would have been out of the question for her. So currently, I believe I was conceived out of wedlock, and that my father hasn't been able to move because of me. My parents were always suspiciously adamant that I wasn't a mistake, completely out the blue they would say how I was an intentional choice, *definitely* not a mistake on their part even when extended family would always look at me differently than they did my sister.

Literally everything makes sense. Why my parents were never really affectionate with each other. Why when I was 8 years old, asked my mother how my father proposed and she said it was ""an agreement"". The way my father would call me a mistake all the time in primary school. Why he always blamed every single wrong thing that happened to him on me. It all makes sense.

I don't know whether I should laugh or cry. My whole life, from as long as I can remember, believed that I was literally subhuman. I thought that there was something bad/wrong about me fundamentally, like I was born broken, or a mistake or something. I'd work extra hard at school and always had the highest grades. I tried hard to always be polite, always be respectful, never talk out of turn, didn't do drugs, etc. I tried so damn hard to be someone worth loving and I always failed.

Thinking back on my mental health problems now is crazy. I struggle with personal hygiene and cleanliness and overly clean spaces scare me. I realise that comes from the neglect. I still only have one pair of shoes from 3 years ago because deep down I don't think I deserve nice things. I haven't had new clothes in probably 15 years because of this mindset I've been trained to have. I bought one jacket yesterday and instantly started dissociating at the mall. doing anything at all that relates to taking care of myself fills me with anxiety.

I wish little me knew that it was never her, that she is perfectly normal little girl and that she deserved better.

edit:  
I can't even say in words how much all the support means to me. I wasn't expecting this little vent post to get seen at all and now I can't even respond to everyone. Thank you guys. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sad that so many people can relate to this, on one hand there's no reason for us to have gone through all of that, but on the other hand I don't feel alone anymore, I hope we all find a way to heal and be happy. I've read every single comment and I've been feeling so many things. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to try treat myself better, and maybe buy some new clothes too haha. Thanks again <3",13451

The thing is that she really likes me and we spend a lot of time together but she told me that other night she already kissed a girl in a party, and i felt really bad when she told me. I feel very unlucky that my first relationship has to be like this, but also really lucky because she is awesome. I know most people is going to tell to leave her, that she is not the one, but after all this years you've been alone and someone shows you some love is not that easy.

1dkktx9,1718913296.0,2024-06-20 19:54:56,self,"I opened up to my Gf at the time, she is now my wife ","I saw the post yesterday about the guy who was having an incredibly rough go at the moment and opened up to his GF about what was happening. He ended up crying, and subsequently was dumped in a cruel manner for doing so. 

The reason I’m making this post is to try and show other men that being vulnerable isn’t a sign of weakness. It is okay to open up to your significant other, and if you can’t frankly it’s a sign that it isn’t the right person for you. 

About 5 years ago I had been dating my girlfriend for roughly 6 months. We went to dinner and a movie and saw the movie “White Boy Rick”. Basic premise is he’s a young kid who ends up getting arrested and sent to prison for trafficking narcotics. There is a scene when the family members are driving down a long country road to reach the prison. This seemingly innocuous scene is what broke me. I really never gave the word “trigger” any credit or merit until I watched this scene. 

When we got home, she knew something was up and asked if I was okay.

When I was very young my father was incarcerated for most of my life for trafficking cocaine. All in all, he served roughly 20 years. It’s something I kind of brushed off, tried to “be strong” and tried to live my life through the reality I knew. Single mother, roof over my head. To me, this was normal. 

Most prisons are built away from the dense populace of society in rural areas in the country side. When I went to visit my dad, I made that exact same drive as the characters in the film. I was completely blindsided by emotion. I held it together until we got home. 

So now back home with my Gf, she asked me what was wrong. I decided I couldn’t keep up the facade and explained what I was feeling. I couldn’t stop the tears, I wept like a baby. She grabbed me, held me in her chest, and the flood gates opened. It had been over 10 years since I cried, so I just couldn’t contain it. She told me she loved me, and it was okay to let it out. 

That was the moment I knew for sure that I loved her and she was the one for me.

It’s now ~ 6 years later and we are happily married. 

So men, don’t be afraid to be vulnerable. If a woman makes you feel lesser than for being vulnerable, she isn’t the one for you.

zn5fwy,1671163138.0,2022-12-16 03:58:58,self,I had an anxiety attack for the first time yesterday and realize I've been unfairly judging people all my life.,"For years I've silently judged people who have anxiety/panic attacks and leave class/work/etc because of one as ""mentally weak"" and thought they were overplaying simple nervousness and just were unmotivated. I knew that anxiety disorders are a real medical condition, but thought that just meant you're more prone to an attack, and that anxiety attacks can't really be *that* bad. 

But I don't have any anxiety or panic disorders, and had never had an attack.

That changed yesterday after my diffeq & linalg final exam. I've always been good pretty good at math. In past exams, math or otherwise, I've had hard questions and some questions I didn't really get, but no situation where a large chunk of the test I felt completely lost on. But so much of this test just felt so utterly confusing and convoluted that for the first time during a math exam I was actually struggling. It was an unfamiliar experience, and I started panicking. The time pressure didn't help either. 

I started feeling short of breath near the end of the test time but it turned up into a full attack after I left the room. I felt lightheaded, dizzy, nauseous, and had to consciously remember to breathe. Even so, each breath felt like I was barely getting any air, and this lasted for what felt like hours. My friends would ask me how I felt about the test, how finals have been so far, etc, but I was so out of it that I basically couldn't even hear them. My mind was a trillion places at once and I couldn't think coherently. It was utterly miserable and even debilitating. I had to leave work early because I legitimately couldn't focus on anything and felt physically sick. (For context, I work in a lab on campus and went to work directly after the exam. I asked my PI if I could take 30 mins to myself in my office to try to calm down, and even that didn't really do anything)

I was lucky it didn't get worse in the middle of the test because had it, I honestly think I could have had a breakdown in the middle of the exam.

Until now, I've never understood what it really feels like to have an anxiety attack like that, and realize I've been unfairly judging people all my life for it. An attack like that really can be debilitating, and people aren't mentally weak if they have to stop what they're doing for it.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the more grateful that I don't have any anxiety disorders because that shit was ***m i s e r a b l e*** and I sure to god hope it never happens again.",859

1jsn1m2,1743917729.0,2025-04-06 05:35:29,self,My younger brother's (19M) friend (20M) sneaked into my room while everyone was asleep.,"So this morning, while I 24F was asleep, my younger brother’s friend (who lives in the same building and whom I’ve known since childhood) sneaked into our house—and then into my room—while everyone was asleep except for my mum, who had gone for a morning walk so, the main door was unlocked. He quietly reached for my left hand and tried to unlock my phone using my fingerprint. Luckily, that’s when I felt someone holding my hand and woke up. At first, I thought it was my brother, so without thinking much, I asked, “What do you want?” He immediately pulled away and ran out of the room.  

I was completely shocked to see him in my room inside our home at that hour, when everyone was still asleep. I asked him what was going on, and he just said he came to see my brother. I was still trying to process everything. It felt really creepy. Like, why would he sneak into my room that early in the morning?

The creepiest part was, I didn’t even know how long he had been in my room or when exactly he sneaked in.  

I didn’t overthink it at the time and just locked my door. I considered telling his parents about it, but then again, it’s not like I see him as a pervert or anything. He’s never seemed like that. So instead, I went and woke up my brother and told him everything. He told me that his friend has been going through depression.  

I don’t know do people with depression normally do stuff like this? When I told my brother, he actually got really angry and wanted to confront him right away, but I was the one who stopped him. I thought maybe there was some reason behind why he did what he did. My brother also told me this wasn’t the first time he tried sneaking into our house. Apparently, my mum had once caught him early in the morning trying to open our main door, but he failed. She found it weird too, especially since he could’ve just rung the bell but didn’t.

Later, I told my mum what had happened, and she immediately went to their place to confront him and let his family know what he did. (My parents are super protective when it comes to their kids.) But what shocked me the most was that he told his parents a completely different version of the story.

My mum explained everything exactly how it happened, and his response was: he didn’t know it was me in the bed. he thought it was my brother. When my mum asked why he didn’t just call out my brother’s name, he said he didn’t want to wake him up.

Now that was creepy. Even my mum felt the same. It was 7 in the morning how the hell did he not see my face when I could clearly see his the moment I opened my eyes? He’s been coming to our place since he was a kid. He knows which room belongs to who. That just made the whole thing even more unsettling.



P.S- I just added some more details to clarify because it seems like some people are assuming my brother was involved or didn’t react the way he should’ve. But honestly, the moment I told him what happened, he got really angry and wanted to confront his friend on the spot. It wasn’t him who stayed quiet... it was me who stopped him. 
Our families have known each other for years, and I’ve literally seen his friend grow up. I’ve never seen him do anything like this before, not even once until today. That’s the only reason I held my brother back. I thought maybe there was some deeper reason behind why he acted that way.
But then I told my mum about the whole incident later.

When I was younger, I used to be really into the ""pretty boy"" look -- skinny dudes with more delicate features and fluffy hair. I used to go CRAZY for fluffy hair. However, now that I am [REDACTED_NAME], I find myself not really being attracted to that look anymore. I can still recognize those types of guys are good-looking, but the attraction is gone. Instead, now I find burly men with beards very attractive. I even find buzz cuts hot now.

I also used to love men who were artsy and the type to write you a poem. However, now I am [REDACTED_NAME] more attracted to the kind of man who knows how to fix shit lol like cars and all of that (ofc that's not always mutually exclusive, but before, the artsy type used to drive me wild whereas it doesn't anymore and it's not something I'd prioritize) I find this change in my ""type"" pretty amusing bc I never thought I'd be into those kinds of guys.




~~~~~
EDIT: well this post unexpectedly blew up. It reminded me of how many cynical ass people there are on Reddit. No, I didn't have ""fun"" with the pretty boys and I am [REDACTED_NAME] ""ready to settle down"" with the burly men. I've never been in an ""actual"" IRL relationship (unless you count the LDR where I didn't even meet the man in person). I shouldn't justify myself but maybe don't make weird assumptions about strangers, y'all. I've never even held hands with a dude so calm your tits lmao. Just cuz I have a pussy between my legs it doesn't mean I have fucked a gazillion guys like some of you want to believe!

Also, since I have gotten many questions on it – I used to be on birth control twice in the past for brief periods but even before I went on BC, I liked pretty boys and my ""type"" never changed while I was on it. It's only last year (and I haven't taken BC in 3 years now) that my type started to make a transition into what it is now. ",4560
1hcd7s1,1733978045.0,2024-12-12 04:34:05,self,I told the guy I like I’m trans,"
Let me start off by saying I think everyone should be able to have their own preferences, I do not find someone not wanting to be with me transphobic nor am I ashamed of who I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I’m not overly political, I don’t insist that trans women are identical to women, I don’t care. I wear the clothes I like, and I do my hair the way I like, and I live my life and in the grand scheme of things I’m happy.

For the past 6 months I’ve been taking a class and afterwards we all get drinks. I’m not exactly open about me being trans per say, mainly cause I just find it inappropriate, considering every one in my class is not so why be the a-hole who preaches about something no one can relate to. Like most social adept individuals, I keep the convos light and relatable. I’ve said things here and there like I remember one classmate was talking about a pregnancy scare and she said something to the effect of “well cause like you know when your about to start your period and you feel etc.” to which I replied “no I actually don’t know, I am [REDACTED_NAME] barren and I don’t deal with that” or I’ve mentioned that I was the pretty typical emo boy of the early 2000’s.

Cut to last week. There is a boy I’ve had a crush on the entire time, with no expectations of anything happening because I LITERALLY do not know what I’m doing. I’ve had two boyfriends in my life ( and a few men who may have said they were my boyfriends, but mainly flukes I used as escapism from my own boredom at the the time) and aside from the fact that they both looked like Abercrombie models there was nothing that I found especially attractive about them intellectually or anything I felt were qualities that could sustain a healthy relationship. I’ve had a hard time relating to men in general, they just speak a different language than I do. I don’t find them funny, I think that they have low EQ’s because they are not encouraged to talk about their feelings with one another, it’s just a different breed that I can essentially be around but cannot relate to. But I did find him different, esthetically he was not the 6 ft rock hard abs guy but I thought the fact that he was not overtly flirtatious or loud with his opinions was attractive. He had a confident quietness in his presence, and I just felt like we got each other. Through the past six months I just felt a connection, he was my straight man (no pun intended) he got the jokes, he was introspective, devoted to self improvement, was not overly eager in the over saturated dating culture, was adorably self deprecating, idk I just adored him in every way. It never occurred to me to have a direct talk with him about me being trans because it just didn’t seem like that was our dynamic, I was perfectly comfortable having a crush on a boy without the need for a resolution. He typically would give me a ride home from the bars since he lived relatively close and I’m a bit of a lush, and last week as I was on some drunken tangent (which I tend to do) he leans in and kisses me. Even in my drunken stooper I knew I should stop it and tell him, but I didn’t want to so I just kept kissing him back. Is it morally corrupt that I did?? Maybe, however just because I’m the odd man out in a hetero normative culture doesn’t mean I get a hand book on how to deal with stuff. For a moment in time I was just someone who was getting kissed by her crush, and I just wanted that for myself regardless of the consequences. 

Next day he asked me out for drinks to which I replied “you do know I’m trans right? I’m sure I have mentioned it in passing, but we’ve never actually had a convo” I felt it best to mention it via text before it goes any further because while I am [REDACTED_NAME] afraid for my safety or anything like that, I wanted him to be able to process his feelings in his own time and get back to me when he felt ready. He replied an hour later with a novel to the affect of and I’m paraphrasing “you’re an amazing woman, value our friendship, but ultimately I’m not the best partner etc etc.” I told him I understand and sorry about the mix up and he replies “I really care for you, and would never want to hurt you” and I’m just devastated. I get it, maybe I should be more upfront but I’m learning as I go, and I stay away from dating in general mainly cause I’m just uninterested, it just sucks when you feel like I’m the grand scheme of things you are so compatible with someone, only to realize you are not, because if you were you would be with them. It’s who I am, and I can’t change that and I wouldn’t if I could (theoretically) and he likes what he does and I have to trust with him being the creative, intelligent, thoughtful man he is that he thought about this carefully and I have to respect it. I couldn’t have communicated better, listened more, worked harder, or given it space…. It just was out of my control and wasn’t meant to be and that really really sucks.",3215

Bad relationships also bring opportunities for personal growth, which, while it may suck, has some silver-lining, and is meaningful. Again, if I only read people's complains, I share in the bad parts of the relationship, but do not get to share in the personal growth.

1g5qu0f,1729171569.0,2024-10-17 13:26:09,self,"A man should want any woman who wants him, is a stereotype that I'm absolutely tired of. ","A recent experience and a comment I saw on a reddit post piqued my interest in writing this post.

So there's a woman in my post-grad who recently asked me out. Let's call her S. 

S and me are in a big circle of friends who I recently found in my university. S told me in a class that she found me funny and interesting and asked me out on a date. For context, S is a pretty woman, possibly an 8 or a 9. Physically I wouldn't have any problem getting attracted to her, but her personality and mine isn't a great match and I realized it way before when we began our friendship. The things she's interested in does not interest me and her worldviews and mine does not align at all according to me. But there's no obvious red flags with her and she's a nice person. 

So I politely declined the proposal for a date by saying that I don't think we'd be compatible and it's better if we stay just friends. She didn't react too negatively to it at that moment and just said 'Okay' and left. I got to know from another friend who told me that she said I'm ""too full of it"" and ""stuck up"". Alright, a little bit of bitterness can be expected and I don't really hold it against her. 

The thing that really irked me is when some of my friends said that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] idiot for refusing the date and how I wasted a chance to date S. Another girl said that I should be grateful that an attractive woman is taking interest in me and I must be stupid to let her down. A guy said I must be a moron to lose the chance to atleast bone S even if I didn't want to pursue her. I don't feel comfortable to lead someone on for sex. Some are even pressuring me to ask S back on a date as I still haven't lost her completely. Keep in mind, these were their actual words. 

Suddenly I'm [REDACTED_NAME] bad guy in my friend group 'who thinks too highly of himself'. I don't think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] AH for refusing to date someone who I find incompatible. Getting new friends is also not a possibility as these are the only people I find cool in my post-grad and there's no chance to avoid them further down the road. I must somehow figure out a way to mend things with them. 

So yea thanks for listening to my rant. Yes it's true that men get less opportunity to date, but it doesn't mean I should accept any and every opportunity even if I don't want to. This stereotype must come to an end. Rant over.




Edit 1 - Damn I wasn't expecting this to blow up like this, although I couldn't possibly respond to everyone over here, I would be reading EVERY comment.

This idea of “if men x, then women y,” is killing our ability to have relationships or even basically get along. Fault is not always, and is in fact rarely, attributable to an entire group of people. 

But I think the thing that annoys me most of all is how quick people are to discount someone else’s lived experience on the basis of a random anecdote. Frankly, you can find a not great looking but charming guy who happened to find a great partner and you can also find a not great looking but charming guy who is perpetually single. They could be equally attractive, about equally moral, and equally charismatic, but one happened to live in an environment where he fit in better, or he just got lucky, and now he has a partner. That doesn’t make him superior, it doesn’t make the other guy inferior, and it doesn’t invalidate the other guy’s struggles and mean they’re all his fault. Now, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t some fault that’s holding the single guy back, but it also doesn’t mean that there isn’t an even bigger fault that the guy in the relationship has that his partner can just tolerate. 

In short, attraction is not a rational thing, and the more you try to game it and explain everything, the more wrong you become. There’s no basis to make categorical statements about ugly people, attractive people, men, or women. These are frankly incredibly large, diverse groups which have a lot in common if you stop seeing everything through the lens of difference and determinism. On top of that, I think one of the biggest dangers with this discourse is people walking away with the idea “because I’m part of x group, and all Xs have this problem, I have this problem.” Recognize that maybe because of a characteristic or piece of your identity, your life outcomes are affected to some extent, but those characteristics and identities do not necessitate any given outcome and do not define you unless you let them.

7x9jg4,1518530281.0,2018-02-13 13:58:01,confession,"When I was 11, my dad’s girlfriend’s 22 year old son used to regularly beat my dad up to a bloody pulp in-front of me. I’m 30 now, and I’m still haunted by it..","I turned 30 recently, and since then, a lot of things have been bringing up some of the skeletons from my past... I’m realising that I’m still deeply affected by them, and still haunted by them to this day. And honestly, I just wanted to share it with someone..

When I was 11, I remember being one of the happiest, goofiest, rambunctious, cockiest, *naughtiest* kids there was. I had so many friends, played sports, had all these play “girlfriends” with all the girls in my class, and had so many healthy experiences living in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. I was just happy and bubbling with life and confidence living with my single dad.

Just before the 6th grade, my dad met a woman. Her name was Dianne. She was also a single parent, except her kids were much older than me. She had three boys between the ages of 22 and 35 at the time, and an 18 year old daughter. 

After a few short months of knowing this woman, my dad broke the news to me that we were leaving Melbourne, and moving in with Diane to a small rural town in the country. At such a young age, I didn’t understand exactly what this meant. But I went along with it, without so much as a peep or murmur.

Soon, we moved to the small country town called Pylong, in Victoria. This town had maybe 1,000 people living in it. And my new school, in total, had maybe 50 kids. My first day of school there was a real indicator of my temperament, as I’d cause the first fist fight in all of the school’s history literally in my first day. The reason? Simply because another student suggested that I pick a fight with someone. There was no reason. I was wild!

Very soon after my dad moved us in, Diane allowed her youngest son, Peter, to move in with us. Peter was 22, lifted weights, and was an absolute monster. My dad was 55. Soon after Peter moved in, even though my dad bought this house from sale of his previous home, Peter began to claim it as his own. He began bullying and intimidating my dad. Peter would change the locks and bolts on my dads tool shed so that only he would have access to it. Peter used to play with my basketball in the back yard, then kick it as hard as he could across the 1 acre paddock behind us into the overgrown grass so that I couldn’t find it after he’d finish. Peter would push me over and trip me when I’d try stand up to him.

Peter began to regularly beat up my dad. To a bloody pulp. In front of me. 

Peter’s temper was like a hair-trigger, and anything would prompt him to hurt my dad. Sometimes my dad would react a little to Peters bullying, and then it would be on. At any time of day or night, Peter would just lay into my dad until he’d have broken noses and chunks of hair missing from hair scalp..

One night, my dad was sleeping in my room with me to get away from Peter. It was like he was hiding in my room. At about midnight, Peter came in to my room with his older brother while we were both sleeping and started both beating my dad up together. 

Sometimes when this would happen, I’d run to the next door neighbor’s house and beg them to let me inside to call the police. But other times, I’d just stand there in fear watching it... frozen. 

Though I only lived there for about 1-2 years, it felt like forever. I’d pass the time after school and on weekends, by literally breaking into whole streets of houses not far from my own. I wouldn’t steal anything. I’d just break and enter, walking around in the houses of strangers. I had no friends, I had no outlets, I had nowhere to go, and no one to see... I missed Melbourne so so much, and felt like I’d been ripped out of my happy, bright environment in the suburbs, and placed in this town that felt like a prison made of dirt roads and nothingness. I felt isolated, alone, and like I was taken away from everything that made me happy...  I yearned to go back to Melbourne where I had friends who loved me, and where ever hung could be normal again. Where I could be normal. 

This all happened for about two years. But for my entire teenage life, I was withdrawn into myself. I was shy, embarrassed, scared, quiet, frozen, all through my highschool years... it took me until I was about 20 to come back out again, resembling what I was like in my previous childhood years.

And this might be a story for another time. But all throughout this time, for my whole life, I was also dealing with an alcoholic mother who I’d see on weekends. My experiences with her equally devastated me. She committed suicide (I believe) when I turned 17.

I never forgiven Diane or Peter. Im haunted by them. I sometimes imagine what I would do if I could pay them both a visit, and let them know exactly what they put me through. I’d tell Diane that she is a horrible human being, and I’d tell Peter (and his brother) that I’m not 11-12 years old anymore, and that iv been lifting some weights of my own.

Sometimes I still feel trapped in that house. Iv never felt closure or resolution. Iv never felt justice or peace... it’s hung over me for all these years, and I don’t know how to answer to it. I don’t know how to forget it all..

I don’t remember Diane or Peter’s last name. Sometimes I think that that’s God’s way of not allowing me to do something that I could regret..

Thank you for reading my story. 

EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone for your support and encouragement. Iv very rarely spoken to anyone about the things such as this that iv experienced in my life, and I’m so grateful for all your thoughts and replies:

1. Yes, I absolutely do want to resolve this against Peter legally. My dad had called the police, so there would have to be a record of it somewhere. Does anyone know how I could follow this up? Or if it’s too late? How can I make him answer to what he did? If you have any suggestions please feel free to PM me.

2. I see a lot of people are asking about my dad and how he is now. After I left his house when I was 16 (new house we moved into after it all happened), I dropped out of highschool, and moved to Sydney with the little amount of money I had. I built a life for myself there, independently.
Meanwhile, my dad went into business with his daughters husband, sold it after about 10 years, and used the money to retire on his eldest daughters property in his travel caravan. He loves it, and occasionally takes long solo trips around the Outback of Australia with his dog. He’s at rest, and I am [REDACTED_NAME] relieved for him.

nn1hst,1622218951.0,2021-05-28 16:22:31,confession,Took part in horribly vandalizing a public bathroom,"This happened when I was about 13 probably, around 2002 or 2001. We were in this rich part of Southern California. 

My friend let's call him Jack and his older brother John were going to a barbecue at a local park in this neighboring town next to ours. It was the rich, uppity place where if you're from my town you don't like it because they're a bunch of snobs. 

Real uptight folks and such. So anyways their family were having a barbecue with some people from their church group and I tagged along. Us being young boys we immediately started thinking of what can we fuck up, let's raise some hell because we're bored and this was far before everyone had a computer in their pocket. So the only way to entertain ourselves was to find some property to destroy. 

We go to the public bathroom at the park where we were barbecuing which was very nice and clean for a public park bathroom, remember it's in the nice part of town. We immediately start filling the 2 toilets up with sand because we were near the beach. We fill them with sand and all the toilet paper in bathroom and just kept pressing the flush button over and over until it starts overflowing. 

Fast forward about 2 hours later my friend Jack has to take a shit. He goes into the bathroom and is reminded they are unusable. There is no toilet paper and the toilets are full of sand and filled to the top with toilet water. He's freaking out because he has to shit. So I grab him some fliers from his church and he shits behind a tree. I thought we were done fucking with the bathroom for the remainder of the evening. We start packing up to leave and I decide to go take a piss before the ride home.

I go back to the bathroom because we left the urinals unharmed. I walk in and Jack's older brother John is holding his younger brothers piece of shit with a piece of paper and drawing one continuous long squiggly line with the piece of shit across the bathroom wall. When he gets towards the entrance of the door he wrote 

""FUK YOU"" and stuck the remainder of the piece of shit on the wall and it stayed. To this day what I never understood was why he spelled the word fuck incorrectly but the word ""you"" correctly. 

But yea the names have been changed to protect people's identity. I felt bad thinking about the person walking into that place when it was their shift to clean it and seeing a pool of sand and toilet water and a wall with shit going across it. But life goes on.

Edit: I've had a blast reading the comments and really did not expect my story of being a little shithead to get this much attention. I assure you I'm a grown adult and don't do stuff like that now and realize me fucking up public property wasn't the most productive way to pass time. I had a great childhood and was raised well. But I had a phase where I liked to fuck shit up, not animals, not a bully, just playing with matches and raising hell in a public bathroom. To be clear I just poured sand in a toilet, I didn't condone the shit smearing, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] what I did wasn't ok at all. Hope everyone has a nice weekend though.",1160

He used to beat us and yell at us about how worthless we were constantly. My mother finally had enough, and said that either he gets psychological help, or she leaves him. He went to the doctor, and was prescribed an antipsychotic medication. When he started taking it, he magically became nice! No more beatings, no more yelling... it was paradise. Then, after a while, he turned mean again. We asked our Mom what was going on, and she said that he stopped taking his medication because he didn't like the side effects, whatever that meant. We felt doomed. Until one day, my mom accidentally? left his prescription bottle in the kitchen. My sister and I looked at each other and didn't even have to say a thing. She got out a spoon and I ground the white pill into powder, and we put it in his orange juice. What a nice day we had!

Edit:

For those saying that antipsychotics take weeks to work, that’s not always the case (in contrast, antidepressants often take weeks to work).

I got pregnant in college, this was a few years ago now, and I was the only girl on campus who got pregnant and kept it, haha. I was very embarrassed, and the father wanted nothing to do with me, it had just been a casual fling. 

I was waiting tables and still going to school, and pretty broke. My family was supportive, and I knew I’d get all the baby sitting I needed, but stuff is expensive you know? 

Anyway, I noticed that once I started showing, I was getting tons more attention from guys. Like, tons more. Hit on, asked for my number every day. Some of it creepy, but most of it actually more respectful than before- tho the creepy stuff was creepier, if that makes sense. 

I mentioned this to a friend, and he told me about pregnancy fetishes. What the heck, I thought, and just curious at this point I looked it up. 

At around this same time, I got a dm on Instagram. I hadn’t made my page private, and had posted a few pregnancy related things on social media. This person offered to send me 100 dollars for a video of my belly. I was like, well, why not? What he asked for was a pretty innocuous video. It was such easy money, I started sending him other updates like that. I also made a reddit account and found other perverts (said lovingly) who were looking for similar stuff. 

This was before onlyfans, or at least before it blew up like it has now. All these guys were content with basically pg13 stuff- rubbing my belly, putting on old clothes, weighing myself. Some would want me to eat a big belly and talk about how full I was, or pretend I shrunk and swallowed them. I mean, it was kinda fun how creative the requests were! And people paid CRAZY money, especially for anything where I acted. 

I put all the money away, and after I had my kiddo I deleted the account. I feel fine about what I did, but I worry sometime about the videos being out there. I was able to find one once that someone had uploaded with the right keywords. I hadn’t made them sign any contract not to do stuff like that, sometimes hadn’t even asked them not to share it, the money was so easy I just got careless, but I suppose they could’ve just uploaded it anyway. 

No one would EVER suspect me of doing stuff like this, and I have complex feelings about it now. I made a lot of money to support myself during a hard time, and it was fun doing it. Some of my frequent customers were fun to work with. But I feel weird and stupid that an unknown amount of it is just out there, and could be found, especially with like AI face recognition stuff. 

Has anyone else done this kind of thing, but not made a life of it? I don’t identify as a sex worker or anything, although I was during that time.  I also worry what to tell partners. I told my last ex, and showed him the one video I could find online, which has since been taken down when the site it was on cracked down on stuff where it wasn’t by professionals. So it’s also weird because I don’t have any proof that i did any of this, so I worry people will think I’m making it up, for what reason I don’t know, but I think I’m just being neurotic about it!

3nf2xb,1443931194.0,2015-10-04 03:59:54,confession,I indirectly killed the love of my life.,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad.

So before I tell you my story, Let me say, I did NOT KILL ANYBODY. Also, before I confess my biggest secret, I will give a little bit of a background. I will not say my location and I will change names, because I don't want anyone in the outside world to know this.

15 years ago, I was 6 yrs old, I looked out my window and I saw a moving truck across the street. I was excited because that house has been vacant for a while and I was in need of a new friend. I was a shy kid. I had no friends, and I was embarrassingly awkward. I stared out the window for an hour for a hint of who the occupants were. I saw her; a little girl my age with blonde goldilocks hair and blue eyes. she was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. She was the first girl I was ever into, and soon, my first and only love.

I worked up the courage to talk to this girl. I saw her drawing on the concrete with chalk. I walked up to her and asked to join. she nodded. So we drew. We drew for hours without saying a word. we laughed and drew and the world around us disappeared as I made a friend. That was the first day I met Lauren. We were best friends for 4 years.

When I was 11, My parents informed me that we had to move. We were moving 3 hours away and I instantly realized that I might be losing my best friend. I talked to Lauren the next day. She listened and nodded. She then blurted out: ""wanna sleepover and watch a movie?"" I looked at her confused. She obviously didn't understand. I told her I am [REDACTED_NAME] away and We wouldn't see each other anymore. Lauren smiled and said, ""Yeah, but you're here now. wanna watch a movie?"" And so we watched a movie and shared a sleeping bag on her floor. She was so warm under the covers. we held each other. I felt her heart beating. We were as one. I looked her in the eyes. I saw my future. I saw love. That was the first and only time we kissed. We lied there through the entire night without sleeping, just holding each other. She whispered, "" I don't want you to leave."" I nodded and started to cry, "" I don't want to go. I'll miss you too much."" Lauren wiped a tear and said, "" are we ever going to see eachother again?"" I nodded. ""We will see each other again."" she smiled and fell asleep. I watched her sleep. ""I promise""

At this point, you are probably wondering what this has to do with killing the love of my life. Well I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to that. the thing is, That was the last time I saw Lauren in person. but it was enough to fall in love. I felt that love burning inside me ever since we were drawing with chalk. One day, I, a 19 year old college student, was on facebook, and decided to try to find her, and sure enough, I saw her. Her blue eyes. she hasn't changed. she was as beautiful as I had remembered. I messaged her. 

We started messaging each other and we quickly picked up where we left off. I found out she lived a few towns over and we decided to meet up for a date. I was very excited. We decided on a quiet park we used to go to when we were kids. I was going to pick her up, but she said she wanted the first time seeing me for years to be in a beautiful place, not my car. so I agreed. I waited at the park. we agreed on 7:30. It was 6:30 at the time, and I had gotten there early because I was so excited. I sat there imagining what my future would hold having lauren back into my life. I imagined what our kids would look like. I imagined holding her in my arms. I imagined kissing her. I heard sirens off in the distance.

It was 7:30 I waited.

8:00 I was impatient 

8:30 I was frustrated. 

9:00 I was worried. I called her on her phone but there was no answer. 

9:30 I decided to go home. I was depressed on the ride home, as I listened to the news. There was a car accident on a road in the town I was in. 1 female was in critical condition. I didn't think anything of it. I got home around 10:00 I lied in my bed, disappointed. That was when it hit me. I got on my phone and googled information about the crash. 1 woman was in shock trauma after the crash and in bad condition.

We were just two little girls. I don’t remember everything we did Just running straight inside to her grandparents to tell them, the first time I really felt unsafe in the world for no reason at all.

I still think about it sometimes, especially now that I work with children. It makes me even more aware of how important it is to protect them and teach them to speak up if something feels wrong.

She claims that it hurts his stomach. So, whenever they're in town and come over for dinner, I refrain from using garlic or onions, which is frustrating because I use those two in just about everything I cook.   

For a little backstory about my step-MIL's cooking, she makes the blandest food. Once, we went to her Thanksgiving dinner. She cooked the turkey around noon, cut it up, and had it out around 3, but no one was allowed over until 5 pm. By the time we arrived, the turkey was cold AF and drier than the Sahara desert. The woman just doesn't know how to make a tasty meal.  

Anyhow, my FIL visited us once without his wife, and I made chicken breast with garlic and onion seasoning, and he loved it. Nothing happened to him after he ate it. He told me that he can eat garlic and onions if they're cooked. But for some reason, when he's around his wife, both of those ingredients are not to be used.  

They visited before Christmas, and we planned a dinner at my house. My sMIL made it a point to call me to remind me not to use garlic or onions. She also called my wife to remind me not to use garlic or onions. I was so annoyed that she made it a point to remind us not to use the two ingredients after years of her constantly reminding us. That night, I cooked the chicken breast with sage, rosemary, thyme, garlic, and onion powder. Both my sMIL and FIL loved the meal. In fact, they commented on how juicy the chicken was and how delicious it tasted. It turns out they both like garlic and onions but, for some reason, just have an issue with it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/fadg4/i_cant_remember_who_i_was_before_adderall/



I know you posted the thread about Adderall over a month ago, but I had to pm you even if the chance of you reading this is slight. Your situation sounds almost EXACTLY (frighteningly so...) like my situation last year. Here is my story and I hope you can take something away from it.


I started taking it without a prescription in order to motivate myself to work hard for the summer school classes I was taking. It was incredible. I felt as though for the first time in my life I had begun to reach my full potential. I got A's in all my classes and even had a teacher recommend I take graduate courses during the fall.


Since buying consistently from a friend is expensive, time consuming, and even a tad embarrassing, I decided to meet with a doctor for an evaluation to get a prescription. After probably one of the best bullshitting performances I'd ever put on, I was prescribed 20mgs twice a day and everything started looking up for me all at once. I was losing weight (oh yeah, probably should mention, I've struggled with various types of eating disorders for most of my life: bouts of anorexia, binge eating disorder, and bulimia), doing well in school, and had even improved most of my relationships with family and friends. I stayed within the recommended dose for a little while at first but I quickly built up a tolerance. I got too afraid to ask my doctor for a higher dose in fear he'd find out I wasn't really ADHD. So I took more and more and ran out early, pretty much becoming a sleeping, gluttonous human blob when I was without it.


I completely relate to what you said about not being able to get out of bed without popping a pill. If I didn't have any, there was no way in hell I was leaving my bed until 5 pm so I could eat every piece of edible matter within a 50 foot radius, and then plop right back to sleep (unfortunately most of it was my roommates' food, so they were constantly pissed at me). Consequently, I would miss a lot of class/homework on the days I didn't have it. Shit started goin' down.


Not only did I feel like a shell of a human being, but my grades were suffering, I was gaining weight, and my roommates were frustrated with my uncontrollable binging. How do you solve this problem? More Adderall is clearly the right decision! I started writing fake prescriptions in my therapist's name. I would go through a month's supply in a week, sometimes less. I didn't really care though because as far as I was concerned, I had an unlimited amount of Adderall.


As I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you're aware, coming down from Adderall is BRUTAL. I would feel so dysphoric I would often have dark, depressing and sometimes suicidal thoughts. On top of hardly eating, I also didn't sleep much, and if I did, it was for 14-[REDACTED_ADDRESS]raight. The longest I ever went without sleep was a full 3 days, but I frequently went two nights in a row (at least once a week). Hallucinations are not as cool when they're not on purpose. 

While in the intense state of paranoia I was beginning to know too well, I decided to research what the consequences were for writing fake prescriptions (this thought literally never occurred to me before I wrote them).  Well, it's a felony, worthy of years in jail and massive fines. FOR ONE PRESCRIPTION. I wrote approximately 30-40.  The sleep deprivation, hunger and intense paranoia hit me all at once and it was in this moment I realized how dependent I was on this drug.  Getting Adderall felt almost like a survival technique. I didn't even stop to think, ""hmm? maybe illegally obtaining a controlled substance by forged documentation isn't such a smart idea after all!""  I was so desperate I didn't even think  my actions through, and was willing to risk my freedom for a quick fix.

 
This is already getting pretty lengthy so I'll cut to the chase. I was taking 100-200mgs a day, with the exception of my sleeping, gorge my face days. I would have done ANYTHING to talk to someone who actually understood what I was going through. I obsessively searched online for forums, adderall addiction sites, chat rooms, anything that showed even the slightest bit of hope for understanding what I felt. Doctor's know pretty much nothing about Adderall addiction and will probably advise you to commit yourself to an inpatient treatment center (which you probably don't need, but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] completely knocking it. my doctor suggested this for me dozens of times). Your friends CERTAINLY don't know anything and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if you've opened up to at least one of them, you've received the same ignorant response I did: ""Why don't you just like, stop taking them?""


This suggestion infuriated me, and made me feel more distant and alone than I had before I brought it up. As much as it comes from a place of ignorance and disregard for your physical and mental dependence on drugs, it's completely right. You need to get the fuck off of it. I avoided it for the same reasons you did: weight gain, uncontrollable binging, extreme fatigue, not being able to think clearly, depression, extreme irritability, poor grade performance, etc. There were even a few times I thought I would never get off this drug, that I would stay on it forever.


My addiction to Adderall was a tumultuous, passionate love affair, but I know I wasn't the same person I was before. And you know you're not either. I completely lost my sense of self beyond that of my addiction. I felt bland and artificial. I don't think you're as bad as I was, but you are physically and mentally dependent on this drug. You admitted it and went somewhere for help, and that's the first step!


Now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to be honest with you. Recovery's gonna suck. Really suck. You will gain weight. You will probably need AT LEAST 2-3 weeks of being able to do nothing but sleep, eat, and shit. You will eat a lot and may feel out of control. People around you won't understand how exhausted and sad you are. That's why you have no idea how proud of yourself you will be when you get over this, because you did it completely on your own. Stimulants are one of the hardest drugs to quit (second to heroin I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure) because they are almost entirely a mental addiction. You will feel tired and hungry, but that's about the extent of the physical effects.


You will gain control over your thoughts, relationships, and mood and discover your sense of self again. You won't feel empty and robotic anymore, and will be able to accomplish things through your own motivation. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to sugarcoat it and say it's not a daily struggle, though. It's been almost 8 months and I still don't feel fully recovered. I gained 30lbs in 3 months (no i did not eat my family), but I attribute most of that to my history of eating disorders, not the Adderall addiction. You will probably gain some weight, but no where near the amount I did in the time I did. Your body will go back to your natural, healthy weight once you get regular sleeping and eating patterns under control. I still experience brain fuzz, and I can still sleep most of the day away. Being in college surrounded by people using, abusing, and selling Adderall makes temptation a constant struggle as well.  Admittedly, sometimes my temptation won.  Knowing what you've been through though, you will NEVER go back to living that way again. I have an incredibly addictive personality and knew I was spinning out of control into addiction, but most people become addicted by accident, or without knowing their dependency until they stop.  Doing it every once in awhile (but RARELY) in a moderate amount is harmless, and I was able to remain in complete control for the last part of my college career. Haven't done it since. You'll be surprised by your newfound ability to take it once or twice a year without any dependence on it or desire to fall back again.


I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this is so long and babble-y, but I want to offer to you what I was needing so much during that dark period of my life. Please message me anytime, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Reddit around 100x a day.


Good luck and let me know how you're doing when you recover!",183

Edit: this was 3 or 4 years ago and I’m currently in an amazing relationship with a very kind man. Thanks for all the support so far guys it means a lot. I’ve come a long way but man, those days were rough. I do feel a tinge guilty about how I reacted, so I appreciate you guys here giving nothing but love. 

Edit 2: Wow was not expecting this to blow up. For those of you saying I need help, trust me I get that. I was in a very dark place at the time. And I was VERY drunk while doing all of this. I ended up going to rehab and am happily sober now. My life has IMMENSELY changed for the better and I handle things way better now!

Edit 3: For those of you wondering why I “let the ex off easy”- honestly I should have guessed he wasn’t that into me. I just wanted him bad and deep down knew he was using me for a place to stay/food/my car/etc. I got myself into that situation. It was a really rough time and I had literally 0 self respect. What really broke my heart was my best friend betraying me like that. I did kick the ex out and he was homeless/without a car/etc so he didn’t get off easy that’s for sure. But at the same time the pain from him cheating was absolutely nothing compared to the realization that I lost my best friend.  

Edit 4: also I realize my title was very confusing and long winded lol. For those confused, I’m a female. My roommate was a confident gay male. I didn’t know the guy I was dating was in to dudes 

Edit 5: I apologized to my old roommate and vice versa. We are both in better places and good friends again. I forgave him and he forgave me, this charade was years ago and we have moved past it

Okay last edit: To whoever gave me gold, that’s so sweet I honestly did not expect this reaction. It’s my birthday today and I’ve had a great time reading all these comments so thanks Reddit. You guys rock ",15085

So we decided to go look around my dad's shed. He used to always be in there fixing something, but at this point in the story it had been about two years since he's gone in there.

For a good hour or two we were exploring and playing and tinkering with anything we could find. 

We found a homeless man that was maybe 30 or 40 something sleeping in one of my dad's very old cars. 

I was a little scared, and clung to my cousin, but he just nudged him awake and attempted to make conversation. His name was Clement and he was actually very friendly. 

Call my cousin stupid for not telling my dad, but he's had friends and their relatives become homeless, and he was sympathetic, so he chose not to say a word to my dad. A little messed up because my cousin was just staying here a few weeks, and then he was gone.

I stayed though, and went into the shed every few days to color while talking to Clement. He didn't scare me. All he did was sit there in the car and talk to me and tell me stories. I was just a kid, and maybe too scared to get caught so I never got him food from the house. How on earth was he being fed, I don't know.

This went on for about five or six months and then one day I went in the shed and he wasn't there anymore.  I cried. I was so upset.  I never told my dad so I couldn't just make this story up now. And my cousin was in another state. I felt so alone, I missed him, I was worried for him. I think this was the earliest in my life I truly WORRIED about someone like that. Saw a post earlier about someone doing something similar, and it reminded me of this experience.

I had 6+ tables and I’m not gonna lie, I had a tough time running all the mimosas that my tables were ordering. I could tell that one table of all women were getting abnormally angry about their drinks taking a while. I apologized for the delay and made a joke about it being an especially busy shift. I offered them a round of drinks on me to smooth the situation over. When I walked away, one lady murmured under her breath that I was an “incompetent cunt”. 

Let’s stop there, its common for people to treat servers like shit, but this was the first time I ever had experienced being spoken to like I was garbage. I shook it off and continued to be nice to them, but it only got worse from there. They started to laugh at me, and shit talk me to one another. They told me that my future career looked pretty bleak, considering I couldn’t even serve tables, “honey, even a toddler can deliver drinks”. When I took their order for food, one woman REFUSED to speak to me. She just stared at me while her friend ordered for her. By now I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I asked her why she felt the need to have her friend order for her? She laughed in my face, looked down at the menu, and said because I was a dumb little bitch. 

Due to the fact I was at work, I couldn’t argue or tell her to eat shit for treating me like I was a dog, if I did my boss would have fired me. They ended up stiffing me on their 200 dollar check. Once they left, I realized the woman that gave me so much shit had left her phone. I took it and went out the back door to smoke a cigarette and try to calm down, who the hell did that women think she is? So I promptly turned off her phone, threw it in the trash compactor, and turned it on. She came back minutes later and asked multiple staff members if we found it, I told her that I didn’t see it when I bussed the table, and that I would call her if it turned up. I never told anyone but I never regretted doing it. When you treat people like shit, expect shitty things to happen to you


Edit #1. Thanks for my first ever metal kind stranger! 

Edit #2. I should have clarified that they stiffed me, as in they didn’t tip me. They did pay their bill before they bounced

Lastly, I’ve been in the service industry for a hot minute and I’ve only experienced this level of disrespect twice. Whether you believe it or not, some people actually think they have the right to talk to servers like this and many restaurants dgaf",13088

No one knows this about me, but now all of you will. Please cut me some slack as I try to piece together this confusing mess of my story.


When I was the fine age of just eleven years old, my dearest of Aunts came for a visit for the first time. Her name was Aunt Flow. Some of you are getting it and some of you are not so let me clarify: Barely getting into my double digits, I became another bleeding woman of society ready to reproduce.


I sound bitter, I know, but by being forced to mature hormonally could have definitely waited until I was at least out of elementary school. That would have been nice. Alas, I was the youngest of four siblings in a boy, girl, boy, girl pattern which meant I was destined to be the spoiled princess. Let me just say this before I get into my confession, and remember this, I was raised in a rather fortunate house where I wasn’t abused in anyway and loved whole-heartedly. I do not take for granted the things that were scrounged up by my parents and the sacrifices that they made individually for each of us. However, I have the slightest resentment towards my mother because her consumption of alcohol when I was younger and how I reacted towards it. 


Mom wasn’t a violent drunk, never has been, and today I would say she was a funny drunk, but back then, in my childhood, she was different. I didn’t like that. I couldn’t handle another spontaneous change in life that was just thrown on me like puberty had been. There were no warnings (maybe the failure start of “health education for elementary students”) but I didn’t know how to prepare even if there was any. I really didn’t notice her change in personality at first but when it became more frequent and totally different to what I was used to; that was when I paid attention. 


The strongest memory I have of her “other personality” is when one night she called me into her room to talk to my sister and me. When I walked in the room the stench of what I thought was rubbing alcohol burned my nostrils and put me almost immediately on guard. She was waving around an interesting looking glass, that I learned later was cleverly called a “wine glass”, and jabbering away about her toy box. She looked drained of all energy and just loopy. Like she had no cares in the world and that what she was holding and her story were the best things ever. Because I wasn’t a complete idiot, I pieced together what she was drinking when she mixed some type of clear liquid that definitely didn’t smell like water from where I was standing, with Pepsi and taking a big swig out of it before lulling back into her dream state of happiness. It seemed my sister and I realized what was going on at the same time since we exchanged glances and started trying to sober our mom up in the limited way we knew how.


At first, we tried asking her simple questions like about colors or our birthdays. She was so out of it by then that it was near impossible to sober her up so we thought maybe her thinking really by telling us a story would somehow wake her out of this ridiculous state. Nope. But she did actually give me a way to release all of my tension from my hormonal prison called puberty.


Mom walked to the other side of the small bedroom and heaved a yellow toolbox onto her waterbed. Now this was a literal toolbox. You know, one you would see on “Tool Time”. Instead, this is what my mother insisted as her “toy box” because inside it contained all of her toys. Yes. You got it. Sex Toys. She opened it up and on the inside was like the gathering of the type of “Pleasure Bringers” I had seen in commercials during late night TV (that I so cleverly watched in the living room when everyone was asleep). She tried telling us the names of them with her obvious drunken lisp and when I watched her get to that point of carelessness; I think I broke a little inside. Here a grown ass woman was showing her eleven and fourteen year old daughters her vibrators and dildos. I know now as I type this that a lot of respect for her was lost and will never to be recovered. Though in my resolve, I forgive her for it because she found her own temporary escape from the stressors of her world back then and if she didn’t I really think she would have given up. Just that blackout drunk night, along with a handful of other times she did this in my presence, was able to keep her sane. I worried for a while as I was growing up if she would become addicted to her releases. If she would slip away from the family because she couldn’t handle the face of reality and never return to the mother I so greatly adored.


Point is, those toys in that box sated a lot of my urges that I had and they weren’t all sexual either. I had many unexplainable emotional troubles that I made disappear with those toys until I had the actual maturity to do something about it. 


I later found out at fifteen that I suffered from clinical depression and Grave’s Disease. The endocrinologist pretty much put the blame on the fact that I hit puberty so early in life. He never said it in words, but he didn’t have to. All the facts pointed to it and when he finally did something about it, radioactive iodine for example, I was finally able to be myself without some looming ghost of depression around me. I was free! And as I grew older and the medicine that helps grows bigger with me, I still found myself sneaking around to dig up her hiding spots.


Didn’t your mom ever teach you that sharing is caring?


**TL;DR** Mom drunkenly showed me her sex toys as a young “woman” who hit puberty too early for her own good. Used toys as a release of multiple uses of the word “tension”. I secretly hunt for her hiding spots she uses now instead of the toy box so I can still get my own use out of them when I am [REDACTED_NAME] at her house.

1krhxyt,1747779580.0,2025-05-20 22:19:40,confession,When I was 19 / 20 I sort of “intentionally” got an airport terminal evacuated,"So, I used to pull pints in a bar at Gatwick airport. It apparently had the longest bar in the world and was the busiest bar in Europe.

If there’s anything you should know about Brits it is that when we go on holiday, we want a pint. That starts even before getting on the plane. Doesn’t matter the time of the flight, it could be 8am, it’ll still be 4 deep at the bar at 6am (a slight exaggeration but not far off).

So yeah, I was pulling pints one day when I was 19/20 (and I’m 54 now so it was a while back) and it was crazy busy, just ridiculous. Eventually I was given a 10 minute break and back then I both smoked and it was fine to smoke inside.
 
I lit a cigarette and started to catch my breath. At some point I sat back in the chair and lifted my head and at that point noticed the smoke alarm. Nonchalantly, without thinking about it, I exhaled in the direction of the fire alarm. I don’t know what I was thinking but probably that it wouldn’t do anything.

 It did.

The fire alarm went off, the terminal was evacuated, 10,000s of passengers must of been delayed. The only other thing I can remember was standing at the muster point thinking I hope they can’t trace *which* smoke alarm went off.

I have no idea how much that cost the airlines and airport but it must of *at least* been 5 figures and that was a long time ago.

I think I was around 9-10 at the time, and my brother was 5-6. I won’t go into details, since it makes me feel physically sick but I just need to get this out and I’ve never told anyone. 

I SA’d my brother (no penetration or anything like that, it was just genital to genital contact) and I feel so so fking disgusting. 

I know people here say that for child on child SA it’s maybe because the other child was SA’d themselves, though I’m not sure if I ever was…though I do remember an inappropriate moment with my moms boss, probably around that time if not a bit younger. I’m not trying to excuse what I did whatsoever, I promise you that. 

I don’t think I could ever talk about this in person, and I’m sure my brother doesn’t even remember since it was so long ago. I can’t even describe how much of a terrible person I feel I am. 

I’m not looking for anything here, I just wanted to get this off my chest since I’ve been carrying it for so long. 

Edit: thank you to everyone who has responded already, I appreciate it and I’ll try and respond to everyone in the morning. For those saying that my brother remembers, I know that is likely very very accurate 😭 I think I hold onto the idea that he doesn’t remember because it at least helps me to not hate myself as much 😭😭 but deep down, I know that he probably does remember:(

Edit 2: I’m sorry for saying that I doubt he doesn’t remember, I don’t mean to dismiss anything he may be feeling. I also want to say (if it isn’t clear enough) that I do know that what I did wasn’t okay, and it’s not ever okay (regardless of age or gender or anything like that) and I’m not trying to dismiss male victims of SA in any way 😭 I knew immediately after that what I didn’t wasn’t okay, as I felt disgusting and nothing ever happened again after that

Edit 3: thank you again to everyone who responded. I think it might be a bit difficult to respond to everyone’s comments so I’ll try and respond to the ones I feel like I can respond to (and I’ll try and respond the best I can to most of them) but thank you guys again ",1438
1be0m45,1710358720.0,2024-03-13 19:38:40,confession,I realize how easy shoplifting is and now I can’t stop.,"I don’t remember exactly when I first started, it had to be around 7th grade. it was seen as cool to shoplift so I did it. In 8th grade I would take the bus (it was right outside the school) multiple times a week to walmart and steal tons of makeup and snacks. I would go to dollar tree and get a lot of snacks and other stores too. I didn’t have the money for the items I was stealing since I was so young. Don’t judge me for this but around that time is when I started drinking alcohol too. Since I had no way to get the alcohol I would just steal it. I was already good at stealing other things so I was really good about stealing alcohol too. In the summer of 8th grade I would drink and sneak out a bunch. And of course I stole the alcohol or was apart of the group that was stealing. I have never gotten caught shoplifting alcohol but I don’t know how to stop since it’s just so easy. I understand the stores keep contact on you and the price of things you have stolen then once it’s a high amount they get you into trouble. I’m trying to get out of that but I don’t have a job It’s really my only option. . I’m currently in highschool and haven’t been going out to the stores often as I use to (I go maybe once a month now). And I quit alcohol but whenever I go to the store I have this feeling I have to shoplift since it’s so easy.",1054

16nebzf,1695192528.0,2023-09-20 06:48:48,confession,I touched multiple girls inappropriately when I was in middle school and early high school.,"For quick context, I(now 32M) had pretty difficult childhood. Large family, untreated Adhd, bullied and targeted by my own siblings my whole childhood, emotionally neglected, and ostracized. Knowing what I know now, I was clearly in severe need of mental health care and therapy as I clearly had reactive attachment disorder on top of the untreated adhd. My siblings locked me in the snow for hours, would attack me and harass me and then I would deal with the same things at an extremely small school (300 students Pre K - 12th). Even knowing what I know now I still lay in bed some nights so angry and ashamed of myself. When I was 15, I had no control of my anger or emotions and so people avoided me. Then, a group of guys started talking to me one day. They pointed out a girl in our class who was known for dating around. I don't know how they convinced me, but they convinced me to walk over and grab her butt. One of them did it first to ""show me it was okay""... so I did. She laughed it off and told me not to do it again... but the guys laughed and told me she ""was just saying that"".. so I did it again later, I don't know if I was looking for their attention or I was just so over sexualized and lonely, but it went on for so long, it happened so many times and she so clearly wasnt okay with it.. then one day in weight class the girl I had a crush on let one of the guys touch her breast for God knows what reason.. so impulsively I reached up and did the same.. but worst of all there was a group of siblings my parent babysat... one of them was not much younger than me, but in teen years even a year is considered a long time.. one day we were swimming and i was tossing them around the pool and wrestling and I realized I was getting ""excited""... I took advantage of the ""wrestling"". It was never under clothes, and it never went past touching... but to me that doesn't make it any less awful that I would do that. I just lay here some nights and these intrusive thoughts pop up like ""remember that time you just did these things to these girls?"" and I get so angry. I pray that she never realized I did that and that I didn't scar her because I was such an awful person.. but even still... anytime I feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] good, and I've overcome my past... these memories haunt me and tear me back down...


Edit for clarifications sake and accountability: 
    So for starters. I think the main feedback I am [REDACTED_NAME] are the  comments about my adhd, other disorders, and the story of the guys. My intent was not to try and use those as ""fluff"" or a crutch.. I over communicate and have had posts on other subreddits taken down for being too long. So I didn't want that to happen and I obviously didn't explain my own perceptions to things properly. 
    My mental health issues are not my fault but they are my responsibility. The choices I made to assault these girls was still a choice I made to chase my own lustful desires and satisfaction with no consideration of them. The ""other guys"" encouraged me the 1st time it happened and with one girl. they did not play any part in it from then on except as witnesses and played no part in the other two girls I victimized... I think my state of mind was looking to it as a road map. Two things can be true at once, first that my life was difficult and thus there were many of Maslows hierarchy of needs that I did not recieve. Second that it does not excuse my behavior or justify it in anyway. But in my studies of psychology I've come across a common thread of seeking the ""purpose behind the behavior"". So I guess my quick typing without context came off as justifying, but that was not my intent nor my feelings on the matter.  

2nd. I want to apologize for not having the foresight to place a trigger warning for anyone else who has been victimized in the past or effected by actions such as this. It DOES NOT bring me any comfort to see other posts about how common this is. My hope for this post was not to hear other horror stories about this being a normal male behavior. I have been in therapy a few different times, however the times I have gone into therapy has felt directionless. Even still, therapist are trained to be unjudgmental, to remain impartial and unmoved. I posted this to get real, true responses. So thank you. 

To those who have offered words of support and understanding. Thank you for showing me that there are people out there who will understand that I strive everyday to get as far away from the person I was as I can. That I am [REDACTED_NAME] that person anymore and never will be again. This was what I needed, to know that others could see past who I was and understand that I despise who I was. That I could still be seen as a person by real people and not just a therapist in a chair being paid to convince me i am a person... 

To those who were critical and correcting. Thank you. I learned a while back the value of criticism. Having real people provide insight into these things helps to identify blind spots and mistakes.

To those who were raw. I appreciate your feedback. I understand there's nothing I can ever do to make it right. I can't take away the things that I did regardless of age or circumstances. I am [REDACTED_NAME] seeking any forgiveness or get out of jail free card. I am [REDACTED_NAME] try to manipulate people to coddle me or tell me what I did ""wasn't a big deal"" or ""normal"". I recognized my failures, my desire to be a better person is not dependent on anyone's forgiveness of ANY mistakes I've made past present or future. I want to be better because I recognized how horrible and disgusting the things I did was and how much hurt and trauma I could have (and as others pointed out) likely did cause. If someone is truly remorseful, they will change with or without forgiveness or acceptance, because it whats right. I can promise you that I will never be that person again, and I will continue doing everything I can to advocate against these behaviors.",1371

I have been browsing offmychest and this subreddit for a few hours now, since I couldn't sleep. Figured I might aswell chip in my story, since I don't often talk about this irl for obvious reasons. Please mind that English is not my native language.

As you can guess from the title, it's not a very happy story. Buckle up, this'll be a long ride. tldr at the bottom.

&#x200B;

My parents broke up very early, I grew up with my mom. My dad wasn't really present throughout my childhood. My mother has had a drinking problem for as long as I can remember. She had a rough upbringing and could only vent her frustration when she was drunk. The way things went down was always the same.

Around once a month she comes home late, waking me in the middle of the night. From then on it's a shitshow. She starts yelling, spitting at me, beating me. Smears her snot in my face or on my bedsheets and makes me sleep in there. One second she yells in my face that she hates me, that my father and grandma hate me, that it's all my fault and in the next second she starts crying and says that she loves me, emotional rollercoaster. This always goes on for the whole night. I don't remember too much but ironically the most prominent memories are the ones from when I was very young, maybe around 5 or something. One night I had to stand facing the wall the whole night while she screamed at me. I was so tired since I was just a little kid but everytime I tried to sit down she would hit me. Sometimes I had to do squats while pulling at my ears, making me look really stupid. Apart from the fact that it was humiliating, she made me do them until I collapsed from the pain, then she shouted at me to continue.

A weird thing she did was she frequently pretended to choke to death in the middle of a rant. She then lay there motionless for [REDACTED_ADDRESS]raight. As a 5 year old, I was completely in panic and had no idea what to do. I tried to wake her up but she didn't respond at all until she suddenly jerked up and resumed shouting at and hitting me for ""not helping her"". Luckily she stopped pulling that one once she saw that I got too used to it.

As I got older she got more and more violent, but the only times I was really scared for my life was when she got the kitchen knife while fighting with her (now ex) fiancée. Luckily no one was ever stabbed. I could go on and on but you get the idea. I never got any help because I was so used to all this stuff. And ofc my mother told me to never tell anyone. Whenever I brought her bahaviour up in the next morning she claimed that she couldn't remember, said that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] things, or outright claimed I was making stuff up. Sometimes she apologized ""I will never do it again, honey"". I stopped listening after a while.

School was pretty shit aswell. I had no social skills because I preferred to play video games all day. I was a weird and misbehaving kid, so I was bullied a lot. Also I was too afraid to stand up for myself, because I only knew punishment. The fact that we often moved didn't help much. All in all I went to 10 different elementary schools across 4 different countries. Poland was especially shit. Not the country, you Polish folk are nice people :) but living with this rich alcoholic dude whom my mother constantly fought with was. Thank god that episode only lasted a few months.

Anyway, I digress. Unsurprisingly I became depressed at some point and have been ever since. don't know when exactly, I think it was somewhere around 10 years old. This torture went on for many years.

&#x200B;

Then it happened.

She came home drunk one morning morning while I was getting ready for school. She didn't get much of a reaction out of me these days and didn't seem to like it. As mentioned in the title I was 15 years old at that time and getting physically stronger than her and I was used to the shouting. Also I was basically dead inside. I was completely nonchalant when she started her rant. Then she said something about my ex gf. It wasn't really all that bad but it was a weak spot for me since she recently broke up with me, it was my first relationship and I was the one who fucked it up. It was the last straw. All these fucking years of constant abuse and neglect unloaded themselves in one moment.

Humans can be animals.

It was like watching a movie from a 3rd person perspective. I had no control whatsoever. I screamed while grabbing her throat and squeezing with all I had. I somehow strangled her across my whole room onto the bed. My big and scary mother whom I was always afraid of wasn't able to fight back against my rage. Not one bit. Now thinking back she even looked kinda scared. So she was on her back on my bed and I was standing above her, squeezing her throat. I have no idea how long that went on, maybe a few seconds, maybe half a minute. Everything felt so surreal. At some point my brain kicks in: ""do you really want to do that?"" I get ahold of myself and I let go of her. fucking mistake.

&#x200B;

She instantly grabs a chair and starts swinging at me full force. I mean yeah, I technically tried to kill her but now I just want to get out of this alive. I block it and it fucks up my arm. Then she fucking bites me in the very same arm jesus fucking christ that hurt. The bite later swole to the size of a ping pong ball. Anyway I manage to get the hell out of that appartement but now I run the risk of freezing to death since we had winter and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with nothing on me but my pyjamas. I encounter a neighbour and ask him to call the cops. I tell them what happened (leaving out the strangling part) and after they see my wounds they inform my mother that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] taken into care. My mom makes a pathetic attempt of trying to put on an act but snaps halfway through and bites an officer, gets wrestled down and arrested on the spot (It was honestly hilarious in hindsight, she played the victim and called me a traitor for calling the cops on her) but got out later on. She had to pay a huge fine though for attacking an officer.

&#x200B;

I moved out into government care. It was honestly cool. By the end of age 15, I had my own appartement for free rent, 400€ per month to do with whatever the hell I want and social workers that were pretty decent people (Kudos to German CPS). However shit caught up with me, my depression worsened badly, I started to drink a lot and later that year I tried to drown myself. That was rock bottom for me.

I've had bad phases since then, there were nights where I wanted to die, nights where I wanted to pay my mother a visit and get my revenge and nights where I didn't want anything at all. However all in all life's been gradually improving for me. Slowly but steadily. The older I got, the more self-aware I became about my behaviour so I stopped getting bullied. Also I learned to stand up for myself, that was helpful. However I still ended up quitting school at some point. I realized I can't force myself to do something I despise for even a second. I just stood up in the middle of class and went ""fuck it"". After that I tried a bunch of different jobs but none of them worked for me. However I found my true passion. I love making music, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] putting all my energy into becoming a successful musician. I no longer care if I might fail, it's really liberating! My relationship with my mother has been improving steadily aswell. Boy it was hard at first, and I made sure to let her know how much I hated her for what she did, but she finally, truly admitted her mistakes and quit drinking. It was easier after that. I could start expressing and letting go of my hatred in a healthy way. She really made an effort to better herself. I also apologised for what I did that day and she forgave me.

I wish I could tell you a happy ending to that part of the story but sadly my mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia two years ago. The stress of coming to terms with what she did and the loneliness probably broke her. Sometimes I think about what I could have done differently. She knows that i still haven't forgiven her and am still suffering every day because of what happened. But I can't change that. I told her it needs time. It's been only six years since the day police took me. She's back in her home country now with her family, they're taking care of her. Thank god for that. The last two years were a huge burden. At one point she was so thin that you could see the shape of her skull, all while having that giddy delusional smile on her face. Horrifying.

Well, there it is. The story of how I tried to kill my mother. I apologise for the swearing, I got a bit emotional while writing this. Granted, a lot of bad stuff happened in the past but it made me the way I am [REDACTED_NAME], and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for that. I learned many things and I wouldn't trade that for the world.

People become who they are based on circumstances, but it is always in our power to change our fate. Don't hate them, no matter what they do to you. Cruel people are often hurting inside. Instead encourage them to be the best they can be!

Life's too short to be unhappy. Strive towards your goals and never settle for less! It could always be your last day on earth, you literally have nothing to lose!

Life's definitely not fair. Cherish what you've been given and make the best of it. Suicide will prevent you from ever becoming happy.

However I realize I'm [REDACTED_NAME] only 21 years old and have a lot to learn. I plan on doing so. I don't want to live a life full of hatred and regret, I want to be able to love and trust somebody again. I want to get married, have at least 3 children, become a successful musician, travel the world, stuff like that. Just be happy. I know I'll get there, one day at a time.

*Tl;dr - I was constantly abused by my mother and bullied in school since my early childhood and snapped one day, almost strangling my mother to death. Police took me in and after a while things got gradually better between us. I've pretty much made up with her. Now I try to live my life as best as I can.*

Phew, I did it! It feels like I wrote up an entire novel. Contrary to my expectations, I actually feel better now! If anyone made it 'til here, thank you for reading! :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm [REDACTED_NAME] up this morning and Jesus Christ this blew up... I've read some comments and want to thank you guys so much for your kind words!! They mean a lot to me! I'll try to answer some comments later if there are any quesions.

Also people have been asking me about my music. I prefer not to disclose anything here, I don't want to turn this into an advertisement for my songs. :)

EDITEDIT: I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a loss for words, man. Just thank you all so much for your kind words, even those of you who had critical things to say! It's just surreal. These comments are coming in faster than I can reply but there is something I wanted to adress, since it popped up a few times.

I understand that a lot of emotions can be stirred up by such a delicate topic, especially if you experienced abuse yourselves. Maybe it's partly my fault, because I focused too much on the negative aspects of our relationship. If so, then I apologize.

But please, if you can, don't write hateful comments about my mother. Some things did go very wrong, yes. But she also did the best she could in raising me. There was always food on the table, she tried showing affection in her own way, she cared for my interests and education etc. and I firmly believe that she has always loved me. She just couldn't always express it, as she's as much a victim of abuse as I am. That's why it hurts me seeing comments like ""you should have killed her"" We have to be better than that! I know we can!

So I just want to make it clear that even after what happened I love her. After all, she is my mom.

07/2022 update: after a few very hard and painful years of dealing with (of course she came back from her home country after a month. fuck me lol) and trying to convince her, my mom finally agreed to medication treatment last year. She has made an incredible recovery. All symptoms have been completely gone since she started. I have also forgiven her and we are good friends now. sometimes good things happen",8615

I belong to India, and this is my story, my confession.
I was always a bright student and though not so good in sports, was still charming thanks to my 6 ft frame and lean physique.
When I was 15, I fell in love with a girl(same age). We dated for almost 2 years, when she realized it was just infatuation and decided to move on. 
It was my first relationship, and I was madly in love with her. I begged, pleaded, cried, requested her to stay back in my life, but she never did come back. I screwed up that year of my school.
Eventually I fought off my feelings for her and got admission into one of the topmost colleges of India.
Somewhere, somehow she was always in some corner of my heart, but I totally lost contact with her for a few years.
During this time, I met a girl who was kind of a mirror image of mine. We hit it like crazy, fell in love and got married.
My life has been pretty smooth and successful as well. I also do some professional cooking and blogging, and in India, its a big deal to do some solid work apart from your regular job.
I am [REDACTED_NAME] in my 30s, have a 1 year old kid, and my wife and we love each other a lot.
I know my life with my wife has been great to awesome till now, but somehow, unsaid, unmentioned, unspecified to anyone in this world, there is a feeling, had it been her, it would have been legendary.

Anyways, the girl is in another country, and she adds me on FB. The first thing she mentions to me is ""our silly affair"" and we talk and shrug it off. 

Few days ago, I had to visit my school where we had initially met. As soon as the nostalgia hit me, I cried. Then I went to the spot where she proposed me, and we spent some of our time, and I cried out more. It was like, time hadnt passed at all and I was that 15 yr old idiot kid again. I did some retrospection, and felt its not because I missed her, its because of the pain that she made me go through

Now, since the time I have been to visit my school, I felt really frustrated, incomplete and lonesome. I try to keep the same old mask up, but deep down I am [REDACTED_NAME] daily and feeling like a loser. What could I have done to make her stay? I was just a 15 yr old kid, and damn! 15 years have passed and I have a family now. But, the thoughts just wont go away.

Because of my extra curricular work, my social standing is on a high, and that girl, in fact tried to get some ideas on professional blogging and all.

I feel like an idiot because I know neither can anything happen r now, nor does it make any kind of sense. Just that whenever I see her activity on FB, or try to remember those days or even call/visit my school friends, I get chills for the really painful time that I went through. I was almost suicidal at one point back then.

I dont know how to get out of this situation. Unfriend her? Block her? Would that serve the purpose? Am I not doing injustice to my wife who loves me a lot? I dont know. I just know I am [REDACTED_NAME] idiot to be in such a situation

I just know there is only one way out of this situation, and that is to shrug the memories off again with all my efforts. But, its getting difficult each passing day. 

EDIT: First of all a huge thanks to all of you for taking out time and read my confession and coming up with some beautiful ideas. Of course, the suggestions vary a lot because the entire situation cannot be completely explained in one reddit confession. I was simply amazed by a couple of suggestion because I had in my mind that whatever you guys will suggest, I would already know it(like Unfriending), but a few suggestions really helped me explain the situation I am [REDACTED_NAME]. I would be replying to all the comments/suggestions, but wanted to say thanks here

Yesterday was talking to a common friend, who told me, that girl got divorced and remarried a few months ago

Then I moved to fifth grade. One day during quiet reading time, I made a decision to lie that I had seen a louse crawl across my desk. I don't know what triggered this idea, but I do know why I did it. I knew that if there were suspected lice, especially after the 4th grade debacle, it would immediately summon a team made up of the nurse and other qualified teachers to do a scalp check of everyone in the classroom.

hex7ud,1592986728.0,2020-06-24 08:18:48,confession,When I was 9 I started the biggest fire my town had seen in 150 years.,"When I was 9 my older cousin (14) stayed with me and my family for a couple weeks. My cousin was a troublemaker and her parents had hoped that sending her to ours would keep her out of trouble for a little while.

One day while she was over I asked if we could go to one of our local forest areas and make a fire to roast marshmallows. When we got down there we made a little makeshift campfire out of newpaper and sticks all on top a rock. Eventually my curiosity got the better of me and I started chucking different things into the fire. Leaves, sticks, pinecones, anything I could find in the little area we were in. Then I wondered what a leaf on a tree would do if we set fire to it. My cousin got her lighter and lit a small leaf on a near by tree. I stared at the reaction in awe and my cousin set a group of leaves on fire. We laughed as we watched the fire slowly engulf the branch. Once the fire burnt itself out we carried on setting fire to bushes and branches and then we realised that the fire wasn't dying out. In fact it spreading.

My cousin started to freak out as she realised the fire wasn't stopping. The summer heatwave had made everything so dry that it was catching fire extreamly quickly. She grabbed my hand and we ran to the dirt road that was on the outskirts to the forest. But instead of calling 999 we just stood there. Watching it as it spread and spread and spread. My cousin almost called them multiple times but I kept telling her I didn't want to get into trouble so she never did. It had eventually spread so much that the fire department had trouble controlling it and had to order an evacuation of a nearby village. It was said to be the biggest fire the town had seen in 150 years. No one was hurt but it did take 10 hours to get under control.

It wouldn't have been as bad if hadn't stopped my cousin calling 999 when we first lost control. Both I and my cousin had promised not to tell a soul but 12 years on and my guilt is still here, I still feel terrible about it.

EDIT:

Ok I think now is a good time to do an edit for extra info that I think needs to be said.

Firstly, I am [REDACTED_NAME]. 
Secondly, as a kid I was emotionally abused. My parents had a God at me for very small things like leaving a cup out instead of putting it in the sink. And I mean my mum use to call me useless and a worthless idiot at least three times a day. It wasn't until my cousin came to visit that I was allowed to leave my house with out an adult (even though a lot of kids could play in the park and go out on bikes ect). My aunt thought my parents 'strict' nature would pull her into shape. I was always seen as a 'good kid' when in actuality I was just submissive and did as I was told. 
Lastly, the reason I won't tell the authorities the truth is that I have a very, let's say comfortable, job. The sort of job that holds all its employees to a very high standard. I have my own place. I have holidays booked for the future. I have a wonderful boyfriend who I love dearly and is helping me lose my submissive programing. If I was let slip that I had been the cause of one of the biggest fires our town has ever seen then I'd loose, almost, everything.

I have been stressing and dealing with anxiety my whole life. I put it here in hopes that it would lift a portion of the guilt and anxiety I have harboured for 10+ years. Thank you to everyone who has said kind words to me I really appreciate it. Also thank you to everyone who has made jokes about it all. I have never laughed as much as I have today. Thank you.",6537
11lp55y,1678258573.0,2023-03-08 06:56:13,confession,when i was younger i would make fake puke at 3am to get out of school,"now, let me preface this by saying i was clearly in no way a normal child. most kids would simply go to their parents room, say “mommy i’m sick”, and proceed to get a day off school. i did no such thing. i nearly never got sick i’m not sure if it was just my immune system or a lack of being exposed to shit but i think i got sick 2 times from grades 1-9 (by sick i mean sick enough to puke). i was always jealous of the kids that were able to get out of school because they were sick since i never got to miss school, so when i wanted to get out of having to go i would sneak into the kitchen at 3 in the morning, take some leftovers and shove them into a tupperware container with some hot water. i would then take the leftover mush and dump it into the toilet at a reasonably puke-sounding rate and fake gag. this would normally wake up my mom as her room was right next to the bathroom. i’d then shove the tupperware container in the cupboard under the sink and wait for her to come in. mind you i only did this 4 ish times over the course of several years but it worked every time. totally don’t know if my mom caught on or knew but i feel like there’s no way she couldn’t have known. just thought i’d share and see if anybody else was as weird as me growing up lol.",2148
10noets,1674937044.0,2023-01-28 20:17:24,confession,I took thousands of dollars when I was homeless so I could stay in hotels,"This is a throw away account obviously. Years ago I was homeless and I had this old beater truck that wasn't really worth much. It was my home as well as my vehicle at the time. Maybe worth like $1[REDACTED_PHONE] max, it was a complete rust bucket but it did run okay.

I listed it on Craigslist and got people to make offers to me on it. I would accept their offers regardless of how low ball their offer was and let them test drive it with me in the car. I would only meet up with these people at like 10 or 11 PM. I'd let them enjoy the vehicle for a few minutes and then say ""Hey, look I need to drive it home since i don't have a ride and my wife won't want to come get me because it's late. When I get home I'll get my stuff out of it. How about you give me half of the payment now so that way I don't sell it to anyone else in the meantime, and meet me at this address first thing in the morning and you can get the car.""

The address was always for a randomly chosen McDonald's.

Sometimes it took 5-10 tries but I would always eventually get someone who was willing to do this. I would then flee to the next county over, buy myself a hotel room for the night, and do the process over again a few days later when I ran out of money for the hotel room and food.

I never got caught somehow. I think part of that is that I always used a burner number on a burner phone paid for in cash from the last person's money I stole. I also never met anywhere in a dense part of town, it was always a little more in the country where there would be less cameras around than if I met them in the middle of a city.

I have my life on track now and I don't do this anymore. Hoenstly if I were in the same situation again I would probably try my best to find a more ethical way to make money. I still feel really bad inside thinking about how pissed I would be if someone did this to me, but at the same time if I hadn't done this I wouldn't have had anything to eat or anything to sleep.",1787
963zjc,1533877037.0,2018-08-10 04:57:17,confession,I did heroin for two years when I was 17-18 and not a soul knew except for my dealer.,"I had a very strange introduction to heroin. I got sort of tricked into it. I had snorted pills before, and the person told me it was an opiate when we did it at a party. This was in 2002, before a lot of pills and such were laced. This party was a sketchy party, I knew almost nobody there at all, it was mostly older people from new york. Except when I did it, it was like [REDACTED_ADDRESS]ronger than any opiate I had ever tried before. It felt mindbogglingly amazing. I obviously wish I never did it. I was super drunk at the time and was basically down to try anything. 

I found out it was heroin while I was on it because the guys friend was yelling at him for basically lying to me and saying it was just an opiate, but at the time I didn't give a single shit. I was in blissful heaven, just laying down on that couch. 

I was a popular girl at my high school. Not like the mean popular ones from Heathers, I was more like the main girl from Clueless. I did drugs and partied but I got good grades and presented myself as the preppy good girl to all the adults around me. I was very well liked by people, and was friendly to people. I threw parties which everyone liked. I was involved in clubs and sports teams. Even to *me*, it was just weird that someone *like me* would ever try something like heroin. 

But I was hooked, right away. I contacted this guy micah who had dropped out of our school, I knew he sold. He had no friends in the school, he barely even spoke english. I told him I was getting it for a friend who had a horrible disease where they could barely walk, good excuse right? Anyways, I did the same amount as before. Very, very small amounts. 

At first I tried to keep it down to once a week. I knew how bad it was. My parents were good, normal successful parents and they would murder me if they ever found out. But I got obsessed with how good it felt. Addictive doesn't even begin to describe it. Nothing felt even close to the feeling that even a small, small bump of heroin gave me. 

Over time I did it more often, but the same amounts. I think it gradually got worse and worse over the span of like 8 months. I was RELATIVELY good at keeping myself from becoming a full on addict. For one, my dealer knew I was the one using at this point, and he felt really bad about me. He wasn't a real heroin dealer, he was a user who was selling me some. And eventually, he cut me off. 

For a bit I struggled. I wasn't able to get H and I was so desperate for it that it made me depressed, and I think my anguish in relation to my addiction became more obvious to those around me. My parents chopped it up to me being depressed or anxious, my friends basically thought the same. I did something incredibly risky to find a dealer, I went through someone at our school and said my friend was looking for a dealer. Its possible that the person I contacted could have told everyone and my whole secret would have been blown wide open, but they didn't. 

And so I found this new dealer, and he was sketchier than micah, but had better stuff. I went back to snorting after my month or so long break where I had no access. I paid for it just mostly through my job. It didn't take long for my tolerance to go back. I entered my senior year of high school as a dope addict, but found it easy to maintain my image as the cool popular girl. Nobody, and I really mean nobody except my dealer, knew. 

Eventually, I knew I was heading to college at the end of the year. I knew I couldn't go on like this at all. Sometime after my 18th birthday, I went sober. Part of it? For my 18th birthday, while all my friends wanted to party and my parents wanted to take me out to a nice dinner, I faked being sick so I could stay in my room and do H all day. It was all I wanted. That was kind of a wake up call for me to get sober before this got worse. And I went back on it a week later, and then 5 days after that I went sober again. During this time, I basically was just in my room or in the park most of my days. I skipped a ton of school. My parents had no idea what was wrong with me. 

Eventually, after trial and error, I actually managed to be sober for a while. Like 5 months. Then I took 2 of my moms pain meds and got high from that, and was VERY close to going back to my dealer but decided against it. 

I went to college sober, and there was not even the opportunity to get heroin at the college. My urges went down, and eventually I just stopped thinking about it as much. I never tried any opiates, ever, after that. 

I also never told anyone about my addiction to heroin. Ever. Not even my current husband. Never my parents. 

Its just so weird to think about honestly. I was so, so not the stereotype of what a heroin addict was, and yet I was one. ",6313
1k1m2xn,1744919757.0,2025-04-17 19:55:57,confession,I Faked Liking Sparkling Water for 3 Years and Now I’m Trapped,"I’m 30 now, but this started when I was around 27, during a phase where I was trying really hard to be one of those “put-together adults” who meal prep, drink sparkling water, and have plants that aren’t just dying slowly in the corner.

So I bought a 12-pack of LaCroix because, you know, that’s what the cool, healthy people were drinking. First sip? It tasted like someone whispered the word “fruit” into a cup of TV static. Absolutely disgusting. But I had already posted it on my Instagram story with the caption: “New addiction lol.”

And that was the beginning of my downfall.

Friends started bringing LaCroix over when they visited. Coworkers stocked it in the office fridge “because I liked it.” My girlfriend (now fiancée) thought it was cute how “into sparkling water” I was, so she bought me a SodaStream for Christmas.

Now I’m in too deep. I’ve become the guy who nods thoughtfully while drinking what is essentially spicy sadness. I have flavors in my fridge with names like “Pamplemousse” and “Limoncello,” and I pretend like I can tell the difference. I can’t. It all tastes like carbonated regret.

Sometimes I just want a normal drink. But if I ever open a Gatorade, someone will say, “Whoa, no LaCroix today?” and I’ll just fake laugh like, “Haha, gotta switch it up!” Meanwhile my soul is quietly screaming.

Anyway, if you’re young and reading this: never lie about your beverages. That stuff will haunt you.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk. ",70113
1ky83b3,1748517104.0,2025-05-29 11:11:44,confession,"I was SA’d when i was a teen, and my so-called friends recorded it","Back in 2019 i was an 18 year old high school student, i had a huge group of friends that i would hang with everyday at school and outside of school. Now, i called these people my friends because we always had each others backs.. regardless of the situation, but unfortunately in this circumstance.. my “friends” were just the devil in disguise. 

It was spring break and me and my group of friends (6 girls including me) decided to invite a group of guys over who went to the high school the next city over. Some of those guys, who we did not know at the time, were already graduated high school and had turned 21 but were lying to us 17-18 year old girls about their age and being in high school. Anyways, a group of 6 guys come over with margarita mix, wine, tequila, weed, some other stuff that us young girls weren’t really comfortable being around. We all were having fun, drinking, playing games, up until i hit my limit. 

I over drank that night, to the point where i was incoherent, sloppy, messy, unconscious making a complete fool of myself in front of my friends and these random guys. As it turns out, i was put to bed by my “friends” they led me into a room and locked a door and made sure i was in bed… by myself. An hour goes by and the girls realize that one of the guys from the group was missing.. They found him outside on top of me, i was completely unconscious, stripped from waist down. I was dragged from inside the house to an outside window and out into the backyard where he was found with me. The whole thing was caught on their house cameras and to add onto that one of the girls pulled out a phone to record..

One of the guys friends that was on-top of me ran over to drag him off of me, which he then proceeded to punch the sh*t out of him. He then ran to “my friend” took her phone and threw it in the pool. Some other stuff happened that night but it doesn’t get any worse than what happened to me in that backyard. That night i never looked at myself or any of those people the same, i was home schooled up until my senior year and i quit my sports and other extracurricular activities because i fell into depression. Quit being friends with those people, OF COURSE! Then COVID hit, the pandemic, the lockdown, i didn’t have any one to talk to about this, i felt disgusted and gross. 

The guy that helped me.. somewhat, had passed away a few months after i was SA’d, which sucked because he reached out and i never responded to him. I am [REDACTED_NAME] 23, and im happy, keeping my circle real small and appreciating the little things in life right now. Every now and then i do think about my younger self that went through such a traumatic experience, i just don’t know if that portion of me is fully healed yet.

If you made it this far then thank you for reading, it has been really hard for me to talk about this with anyone. 

TLDR; In 2019, at 18, i was SA'd by older guys at a party hosted with my ""friends"" while i was unconscious. My so-called friends put me to bed alone, and one of the guys assaulted me in the backyard, which was caught on camera. I fell into depression, did homeschool till my senior year, and felt isolated during the pandemic. Despite finding happiness now, I still wonder if i am [REDACTED_NAME] healed from the trauma.",679

They paid me crap and I couldn’t afford anything. I quit after 3 months as I couldn’t survive off the pay anymore. During the last month I stole so much food and I’m not just talking 2 sandwhiches here and a bag of chips there. I had control to the cameras and would turn them away from the parking lot when I did this and the district manager never noticed as he rarely watched the cameras anyways. There was 15 stores in his area anyways. I would take packs of salami, pepperoni, lettuce, cookies, boxes of chips etc, whatever I could eat at home. My food costs went up some, but I didn’t care. My district manager didn’t ask me about it until a few days before I planned on quitting. I had a meeting with my crew about watching their waste (knowing damn well they weren’t) but my last day I took so much stuff. I went back the next Friday to get my check and the district manager didn’t say anything. Nobody ever said anything. I probably took close to 1,000 dollars in food from the store.",1669
8h4fb3,1525485467.0,2018-05-05 01:57:47,confession,I had sex with a famous musician when I was 16 and I hate myself for it,"This has been on my mind for a while now. It's something that happened 10 years ago and I've kept it a secret along with my friend who also never told anyone about it but it's been making me feel depressed because I feel cheap and used the more I think on it. So yeah 10 years ago when I was 16 I went to a concert with a friend that was by a pretty big band, they were big in the 80's and still popular then so we were pretty excited to go. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to say who it was and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] really thinking of trying a lawsuit or anything I just want to talk about it and stop bottling it up inside. 

So we went to this show and it was awesome, the band were fucking amazing and we were in tears through most of the thing it was that good. This was the first proper concert I'd ever been too and the crowd and everything else was electric.  Before the show we were at the front and got talking to one of the security guys and joking around so after we saw him again and we asked him if we can go backstage and get an autograph and maybe a picture. I'd bought something in the hopes of getting it signed so we took our chances asking, can't hurt right? So he kinda smiles and says he'll go ask somebody if it's okay, he talks to this guy who it turns out is their tour manager and he looks at us for a minute and then asks us what our names are and we tell him and I say I won't bother them for long I just want my record signed etc. He thinks for a second then asks if he can take a picture of us for the tour photos and we agree posing for it. He then says he'll be  right back and will go ask the band if they are okay with visitors backstage. 

We were really excited at this point because it looked good, we spent the time talking with the security guys about all the bands they've seen play the venue and the tour manager comes back a little time later and says he'll take us backstage giving us a pass. Some others had shown up by then asking but he turned them away saying they can only accommodate us and that since we asked first he'll let us in. When we got backstage there were already women hanging around, they didn't really look like fans so we assumed maybe they are girlfriends or wives etc. The tour manager introduced us by name but nobody seemed too interested at first. After a little while they call us over and we talk to them. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] nervous and ask them to sign my record, they sign it and we talk about it and they tell us some stories about when they recorded it, we take some pictures and all seems great. 

The conversation slowly gets more personal, the bass player asks if I have a boyfriend and some questions about my sexual experience. I answer that I've not done much more than kiss a guy since I didn't really know what to do. I was scared that if I didn't answer they'd think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and kick me out or something. They seemed more talkative after that and invited us to sit next to them and made conversation. They asked if we'd come to their after party and we excitedly agreed thinking we were really cool because we were getting into a real after party with all these famous people. 

They left and we were taken in another car to their hotel and ushered into a back door and  into an elevator. The crew members took us to a room and let us in where the band guys and some others were hanging out. We hung out at first, they gave us alcohol and got us drunk, we just thought it was fun at first. They offered us pills and weed and we agreed to it all because we didn't want to say no. I started feeling lightheaded and like something bad was going to happen, I said I wanted to leave and tried to get my friend but a couple of the guys told me it'd be fine that they'd take me home when I sober up. They told me to lay down and ushered me to one of the beds. I remember really feeling out of it but I recall seeing my friend on a chair and one of the band kissing her and his hand was in her skirt. 

At that point I felt somebody touching me and he said it'd be okay because he'll be gentle. I tried to push him off but he kept pushing me down until I gave up fighting and just let him have sex with me. Everything just went silent in my mind at this point, I knew what was happening to me and I knew somewhere they were doing the same to my friend but I just went to another place. After he was done they pretty much just took it in turns to have sex with me and my friend. After a couple of times I was sitting up and felt sick, somebody gave me some medicine and said it'd make me feel better and I just took it and tried to find my clothes stumbling around. They were laughing at me and somebody asked if I need a shower which I did. There was like a door between two rooms and one guy who I guess was one of their crew or something pulled me in the other room and said to use the shower there. He was commenting on how I have a nice body and as I got in the shower I got really dizzy and blanked out, I felt somebody get in there with me and I assume it was the same guy, he did stuff to me and I lose time there, I woke up in a bed naked and the crew guy was standing around on the phone, he hangs up then he told me to shower and get dressed which I felt like I was doing before I blanked. 

After I did he was waiting for me and grabbed my arm pulling me into the corridor. He asked somebody about another girl who turned out to be my friend and they said she's in another room. He knocks on this door and an older guy in his underwear answers and inside I see she's on the bed naked. He says to get her in the shower and dressed because he's getting rid of us. We wait for a while and I can barely stand because I still feel drunk and sick, she comes out looking confused and she's crying we hug and then the crew guy still has an attitude and tells us to move pushing us to get in the same elevator we came up in. We go out a door and into a car where he asks where we live. My friend said her address because she knew her parents weren't home and her older brother was at his girlfriend's place so we wouldn't get in trouble for staying out late. 

The guy dumps us a couple of blocks away and tells us to walk which we did. It was like 3\-4am when we got back I just showered again and went to sleep. I was really angry the next day and cried but just said it was nothing when my parents asked what's wrong. I just tried to bury it and forget for years after that and so did my friend. We never even spoke about it after that day we just agreed to forget it. Some stuff triggered my memories recently and I keep having flashbacks to these guys all standing over me laughing while they hurt me. 

I guess they knew I was just another stupid teenage girl impressed with a little star power that they could manipulate and they took full advantage. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] even sure if everything that happened to me because I blanked for a long time. I don't know of anything that happened to my friend but she probably had a similar experience to me. I remember seeing older women at the hotel partying but nobody else our age. I wonder how many teenage girls this happened to, if they regularly invited some to take advantage of them and dump them after like garbage. I feel used and cheap for letting that happen to me.

I was super shy and borderline crippled about girls, but still had friends. Got invited in a huge shisha party, and started to drink a lot. I ended up in the backyard (we were at least 20-25 there) talking with a group of friends. And that girl that i didn't know was super drunk like me. We were all from the same highschool i precise.we were standing next each other while in a circle of ppl talking. I just placed my hand on her ass for some fking reason. It felt wrong doing it but I couldn't help. She then raised her eyes to me, and then looked somewhere else like nothing happened. The worst is my hand stayed there for soo long it felt like several minutes. I cringed and felt horrible over that story for years, especially since some friends noticed. Anyway i saw her maybe a week later. The scene felt like some higher entity planed it. I was coming back in the highschool for class, and she was coming out. The entire front and inside court of the place was dead empty, not a bloody sound even if losts of ppl hang out there usually. She walked out on the front bridge as i engaged on the other end, she saw me, i looked at her and felt super bad, was awaiting disgust, hate or fear... But then she gave me a bright smile. We never met outside of the party, no common friend, so she can only remember me from the party. This is one of the most bizarre stuff i ever witnessed in my life.
I mean she probably just didn't care but damn that's some serious level of chillness

Edit : wow i didn't expect a storm of conflicting thoughts like that. I have written this fast, in a one shot idea, just because i discovered this sub, not thinking i could reach so many people. I would have definitely not have taken such a light tone if I had known. I want to say i know there is nothing right about it. Those who called me a creep are correct, i acted like a creep back then. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about those of you who lived a sexual assault and might have been hurt reading this. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] no way saying that it was okay or anyone should do this. I was a frustrated and anxious kid and that led me to touch a girl without her consent. Alcohol is a big factor but doesn't excuse anything. Be sure of one thing though, i didn't only ""cringe"" at it, i hated myself and found myself disgusting. I never did anything like it again. Discovering sexual pulsion and alcohol at the same time as a boy is dangerous for girls. I understood how strong alcohol was and how bad the consequences of my actions could get if i let my pulsions be stronger than my values.
Now for clarity, the whole point of my post was the instant on the bridge. What i couldn't wrap my head around was the timing. She raised her head from her phone, saw me and instantly smiled. I don't know how she could have felt then, but i expected a first negative reaction, at least some fear or discomfort before she put up a defense mechanism...

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] at how some would kill me if they saw me rn, and some saw this as a potential start of romance or hookup.
I only wish peace to all of you, you don't do what i did, don't let others do it, and that you are confident enough to just try to seduce normally and not becoming a monster",779

Away from my group of friends,  I wanted to ride the Batman ride when they went to lunch. As I stood in line - and this is burned into my brain - a big harley/  biker guy and his skinny woman kept making out behind me. She had no bra on, but did have a black tank top shirt. It made me uncomfortable,  but I was more interested in the ride.... and looking forward. 

At one point,  I was going up the stairs & she ran her hand up the inside of my leg and grabbed my ass, trying to cup my balls. I jumped& said wtf. He said ""like what you see?"" and grabbed her boobs from behind. They laughed ... and laughed... and I was mortified.

.... as I grew up I kept thinking,  why didn't I ask to see hers? Why didn't I ask if I could turn the favor?  She was hot! 

Why was I so uncomfortable? 

Then I realize:  I was molested by some random perv. There is no justification or response.

He was mean, dismissive, and always made a point to put me down or call me stupid. Anyways through a friend of a friend of a damn friend I found out this kid had an edgy ass tumblr account.

The night of this discovery, I hatched a plan. I made a fake tumblr account calling myself Stacy (it’s not my name) and saying I was from California (it feels like everyone’s from there) and posting typical girl tumblr stuff, getting followers, etc. 

I basically spent a week concocting and grooming this fake account of mine - there couldn’t be any flaws. 

Once I felt like my mask had been adequately made I popped him a PM

“Hey I like your profile pic, is that you?  ;-)” 

I waited for what seemed like hours, checking and rechecking my account to make sure there was absolutely no way he can tell it was me. Suddenly, my inbox notification lit up:

“Yeah, wanna see more ;-)” 

Success. 

For the next few days I had texted this kid, digging into his personal life and his secrets, trying to find anything that would give me a leg up on him. It didn’t take long for him to get comfortable with an anonymous girl with the thirst he had, and things started to get....fuzzy. 

I’ll never forget it. I was up in bed, getting a little sleepy, when he messages me: 

“Hey can I ask you a question?”

Hm okay. I respond “Sure, go for it” 

He takes a while to type but finally it comes out: 

“Do u got any fetishes?”

I look at the time - 1 a.m. 
Ah yes, the peak thirst hour

Though I was feeling a little uncomfortable to be discussing this with a greasy fellow I knew, I decided to trek on.

Thinking of the first fetish that comes to mind, I quickly respond “Ya I love tentacle porn”

Without hesitation he responds “Oh..here’s mine..” and links me to his alt tumblr account: Pages upon pages of drawn furry porn, gifs of people screwing animals (actual animals guys) and even a few pictures of him in cat ears and a tail. To say the least, I was shocked, and it almost hurt to look. 

After that I never responded. He continued to send me a few frantic messages but stopped after a few days. In school I struggled sitting across from him, knowing of the secret alias he lead. 

I had uncovered a goldmine of blackmail, but with such a prize came the curse of having to bear the knowledge that this kid wanted to screw animorphs and horses.

In the end, it was too cringey to even blackmail him with it, let alone tell anyone else about it. I just couldn’t go through the awkward exchange that would be telling him it was me the whole time, and then have to go to school with him for another year. And when you think about it, we both kind of lost there.

But I don’t care. 

Screw you, Kyle, you were mean and I’ve seen those weird ass pics of you and your fetish 

TL;DR: Kid was mean, made account to catfish, uncovered dark furry secret, didn’t tell anyone in end

1jd8q7a,1742204218.0,2025-03-17 09:36:58,confession,my brother asked me to touch him when i was a child,"so my brother is about 10 years older than me & this is one of the only memories i have of my childhood. 
this happened when i was about 5 or 6, my brother and i were showering, i have no idea why we were showering together but im assuming it was because i was so young? 
my brother would have been about 15 or 16 and i remember him stroking himself and then asking me to touch his penis, i said no and then he suggested i should put it in my mouth. i remember this so vividly, i was so small it was right in my face and i was really scared. 
now we are both adults and he sometimes talks about his sex life with me, i dont know if its because of that experience or my other sexual trauma that i get extremely uncomfortable but i feel as though he lacks boundaries in what he says to me.
 i have a 3 year old niece from my other brother and i am [REDACTED_NAME] very protective of her & get very uneasy if they are alone together. is that just because of what he did when we were younger? did he do what he did because of puberty and hormones? we are quite close and this has come back to me recently and im struggling to forget it again. 
UPDATE: 
ive told my older brother (not the abuser & father of my niece) and our mother, im ceasing contact with my other brother. 
thank you for all of the support & validating what happened to me. i know now that what happened was abuse and it wasnt right ",442
1k6m3ae,1745478629.0,2025-04-24 07:10:29,confession,I work with the elderly. And I can’t bloody stand them.,"I work in a care home. Challenging behaviour, aggression, dementia, schizophrenia, health issues, bed bound, nursing, the lot. 80 plus residents, 4 units. I didn't realise until I worked in care how rude, arrogant, entitled, nasty, racist, homophobic some elderly are. Out of all 80 plus only about 8 are actually decent. They are so disgustingly rude it's unbelievable and this is even the ones who are non dementia. 

Dementia crowd are a different breed. Some of lovely, some are the most awful people I've ever met and before you guys go crazy and scream but it's their dementia!!!! Yes. Some of it. But there's still a human being under the dementia and there's no way calling one of my black colleagues a monkey, n***ga, wog and specifically attacking them for being black (or our Indian ladies) is new to them. That's been there for decades. One guy looked at one of our new african sponsorships and said ""get back on your banana boat and fuck off"" 

They treat us younger people literally like we are their maids, barking their every want at us when they can see we are busy. They hurt us, berate us, go out their way to make our job more difficult. One lady (non dementia) threw her dinner plate with her dinner on at me because I got her husbands sugar wrong in his tea.

I was targeted and attacked my entire pregnancy. Zimmer frame to the stomach, punched in the stomach, spat at, had a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher sprayed at me when I was heavily pregnant, told I should be ashamed of my mixed race baby. One new entry came in and only lasted 4 hours before his previous care home was called to take him back as he chased me saying he wanted to kill me and my baby. I've had shit thrown at me, my hair pulled, dirty nails dug into my skin and scratched. 

Another guy threatened to rape my younger colleague which really upset her. 

They're just vile. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and tired of saying we need to respect our elders and they're sweet little innocent cuties. There's some really nice ones sure! And I absolutely love doing care with them. But the others are just so nasty. 

Edit: just an add on.. in my experience schizophrenic people (medicated) are the sweetest people ever. We have a gentleman who is on injections each month and he's a HUGE guy. Big, muscly, 6 foot plus. He's in his 60s and he's so lovely and often tries to protect female staff from other male residents. Our schizophrenic ladies have their moments but generally are really kind and really intelligent too. ",19876

b3ylfj,1553216191.0,2019-03-22 00:56:31,confession,I framed my mother's ex husband when I was 5,"So, for a little background, my moms ex husband was a jerk. Later on in life, I found out that he was even worse than I thought, but even to 5 year old me, he was a jerk. For example, there was one summer that he spent all of our money (meaning his and the money from the THREE jobs my mom worked at the time) on cigarettes and booze and other dumb shit, leading to me and my sister having to spend the summer at my grandmother's because there was literally no food in the house and my mom had to live off of bread and butter for about 3 months. He was that kind of guy. 

So, when I was a kid, I always got up much much earlier than everyone else. I can't remember why, but it was probably just so I could watch cartoons in peace. One morning, I went into the living room to find this dudes pocket knife on the couch. It was closed, but i got curious. 

I opened it and I was playing with it, when I had a thought. Obviously I can't remember the actual train of thought, but it led to me deciding to cut my hand, right in the center of my palm, so that mom would be mad at Meat-Head-Mcdonald. I immediately started bleeding, and a lot. (Now, I know that I bled so much bc I have a blood clotting disorder, yay me) I started screaming, mom came down the stairs along with Dick-Wipe, and they saw what happened. 

I told mom that he had left the knife open on the couch arm, and I had put my hand down on it on accident. This led to one of their biggest fights, with mom saying that he was endangering me, and Micro-Penis saying he swore he didn't leave it open. 

So yeah. I still have the lovely scar on the middle of my hand to remind me that I was more of an evil genius when I was a child than I ever will be again. Fun.

1ll545m,1750956508.0,2025-06-26 16:48:28,confession,Our family “movie night” tradition is dead and I couldn’t be happier.,"A few years ago, I started doing weekly family movie nights to spend more time together. It sounded wholesome, and honestly, it was at first. We’d make popcorn, pile up on the couch, and take turns picking movies. The kids were excited. I was excited. It felt like we were doing something right.

But slowly it became a chore. The kids would fight over which movie to watch. Someone always hated the pick. They’d get bored 20 minutes in and start bickering or playing on their phones. I’d end up frustrated, sitting there alone watching some random animated sequel I didn’t even like. Meanwhile, I was stressing about work stuff I was ignoring just to keep this “tradition” alive.

So this spring, after yet another failed movie night where everyone ended up storming off, I just… stopped. I didn’t announce it. I just didn’t bring it up again. And nobody noticed. Not even once.

And honestly? It’s been great. We still hang out, just more naturally. Sometimes we play board games. Sometimes we take walks. Sometimes we all do our own thing and that’s okay too. I’m not forcing “quality time” anymore just because I saw it on Pinterest.

Edit:
If weekly movie night works for your family, that’s amazing. Keep doing what brings you joy. But if it’s become another checkbox in a never-ending list of things that are supposed to make you a “good parent,” let it go. You’re allowed to outgrow traditions. Your kids won’t remember every themed night they’ll remember how you made them feel. And I’d rather be present and relaxed than stressed and pretending.

sq51f2,1644601299.0,2022-02-11 17:41:39,confession,I used to steal from my store when I was a manager at McDonalds,"So I used to be a shift manager for a McDonalds. I was in charge of counting the tills at closing, so I had easy access to the money. I had the perfect scam…I had a group of teens working with me, and the way it worked was we memorized the prices of the most common orders. Back then the menu was simple, and most people ordered the combos. We had a price chart and calculator beside the drive through register to help with the total. We’d tell the customer their total, then ring up a small coke or coffee to open the till, make change, and leave the extra in the box. When I pulled the register, I would take out the exact amount of what the report said it should have, then keep the extra that we had scammed. We didn’t mess with every order, so it just looked like a slow night. On a busy Saturday night, I could bring home around $400, sometimes more, even after splitting with my co-conspirators. I stole probably over $10,000 in a year back in the early 1990s. When I got sober, I had to go make amends to the owner. It sucked, but it was the right thing to do.

j1fzuo,1601312697.0,2020-09-28 17:04:57,confession,"When I was 10, I insulted a random lady on the phone and... totally got away with it.","As a child, I sometimes liked to do ""telephone pranks"". Usually these pranks were very tame. I would call a random number and creepily breathe into the phone while the other person would say ""Hello?? Hello??"" until they eventually hung up and I moved on to the next number.

One afternoon, though, some middle-aged lady got super triggered. I guess she was the 90s version of a Karen. When she realized I was a child, she gave me an angry lecture about how I was misbehaving and how it wasunacceptable. I don't know what it was about her but something about her butthurt yelping got me really triggered too. I was actually a very sweet and well-behaved boy and most adults loved me. Perhaps because of that, it really rubbed me the wrong way when she called me a ""snotty brat"". I felt treated unfairly and wanted to give her a shitty day. So I laughed in a rude tone and said something like: ""Yeah? Well you couldn't possibly know cuz you're dumb as rocks."" There was a short pause - she was clearly stunned by my words - before she totally freaked out. At this point, I let loose like my 10-year old tongue had rarely let loose before. I called her a nasty old witch, a dumb crackwhore, a disease... you name it. Any insult that came to my mind I promptly hurled at her. Some of the things I called her were hilarious but some of them were 100% over the boundary... as in, I'd be angry if my child said them to an adult (let alone a stranger).

At one point, the lady said: ""Just wait you little brat, I have your number. I'll call your parents."" At the time, most telephones weren't capable of knowing and showing the caller's number. It was still a pretty new technology and so when the lady claimed to have my landline phone number (the one I was calling from), I assumed it was just a bluff.

Unfortunately, it wasn't. About 15 minutes later she called back and my mom picked up before I could stop her.

At this point, I was genuinely terrified. Some of the things I had said were pretty horrible and I knew my mom would hate it. Surely, there would be some ugly punishment. Instead, however, I heard my mom reply in a polite but skeptical tone: ""Noooo, you must have dialed the wrong number, my son would never do that.""

Like I said, I was usually a goody-two-shoes who was always nice to everyone and brought home good grades from school. So, it made sense for my mom to be very skeptical (and yet, that angry lady was totally right about what I had done). After some back and forth, my mom called me and said: ""There's a lady here who claims that you called her before and insulted her horribly. Is that true??"" I gave her my most innocent smile and said: ""Huh? Insulted her? No... I was playing in my room, I didn't call anyone."" My mom just said: ""Yeah, I thought so."" Then she went back on the phone and said to the lady: ""I just asked my son and he says he didn't do any such thing. I also don't think he would ever do such a thing. Frankly, you seem like you've got some screws loose. Don't call us anymore, you probably misdialed or maybe you imagined the whole thing."" I heard the lady screaming and shouting in anger and then my mom hung up on her and simply went back to her gardening work. I've never told my mom that that ""crazy lady"" actually hadn't been crazy and that she had been saying the truth.",5324

One of them my best friend and two other girls we just knew from previous years. One of the girls was always sensitive and insecure. She was very conservative and did not like anything that wasn’t following the rules. Me and the other two would tease her a lot about being “lame” or “boring” and try to pressure her into doing things like sneaking out or drinking. We just thought that we were the shit and that she should be grateful for getting to hang out with us. One day she invited me over to her house. I went over and when she left the room I started going through her stuff and found a little journal. I quickly flipped through it and saw my name as well as the other girls. I don’t know why but I just shoved it in my bag and left shortly after. I thought I could find some cringe or embarrassing things she wrote to laugh at. I remember riding my bike home so fast just so I could read this thing. I got home and read the entire thing. In part of the journal she said that “popdart31 made me cry for three hours straight”. She wrote about how I and the others would bully her. I went back a few days later and put it back where I found it. I will never forget how bad I felt realizing that the shit I said to her actually hurt her. I never spoke to her again after that. I thought she would be better off without me around her. I even dropped out of the club we were in together. I never told anyone I stole her diary because there’s no excuse for that. I wanted to read it to embarrass her yet I was the one embarrassed,4303

Last night my friend and I went to a concert an hour away. We got there early and decided to get something to eat. We shared some spicy Korean fried chicken and a panini.
We get to the concert, and about an hour in… I thought the smell (a straight up sausage and bell peppers smell) was my friend burping or something?? a little while later, the smell comes again. I’m confused. we were talking, she didn’t burp, so I’m like, ok someone else around is probably burping or literally eating bell peppers LMAO. The smell was so random and brief, but so consuming. Time passes, the smell appears once more, she says something along the lines of “I keep smelling bell peppers” and I’m like “oh my god me too???” We had a laugh when we were able to finally hear one another leaving the theater, and head home. All is well. 
Writing this now, the day after. The smell was me. I just farted, and yea. I was shocked lmao. Spicy food can upset my stomach sometimes, and tbh I don’t think I even fully noticed I was slipping out farts at the function because I was so overwhelmed, and when I did discreetly let one out I did not imagine it was that smell somehow?? 😭
So yea. Went to a concert, goofed on the potential gassy queen. I was the gassy queen all along. 


EDIT: to clarify, since you guys wanna be mean lmao 

I didn’t explain what I meant well. I do not have a “loose butthole” 😌
I was not thinking clearly bc I was overstimulated. when I tell you I truly was sooooo sure it could not be me producing the smell bc it didn’t even smell like a fart. my brain was just dissociated so I wasn’t putting 2 and 2 together that the smell was me, which sounds dumb, I’m aware, but it’s what happened lmao. I knew I was farting, it was just an afterthought. Do you really remember every time you fart? 

2. I know bell peppers aren’t spicy, I never said they were. I said the fried chicken I ate was. I didn’t even eat bell peppers. I have no idea how my fart smelled like that 

3. The smarty farties who are being bummers in the communal fart chat, I hope you go to fart and it’s poop.

9ecndr,1536496552.0,2018-09-09 12:35:52,confession,When I was a young child I helped my Mom hide her cheating from my Dad and I've lived with the guilt ever since I realized what I did.,"This will be a lengthy wall of text post because I have been keeping this in for so long.

&#x200B;

First she isn't actually my real mom but my much older sister. My birth parents had me late in life but were killed by a drunk driver when I was a toddler and I have no memories of either of them. My sister and her husband adopted me and I have always known them as my parents and their two children as my younger siblings.

&#x200B;

My dad had a job at the time that required him to travel from home frequently.

When I was maybe five or six my mom cheated on my dad.  I don't remember too much of the specifics but I do remember a time there were two strange men I've never seen before in our house when  my dad was out of town.  One of the guys had even played xbox with me while the other guy was alone with my mom in her room. As a kid I didn't know what they were doing.  Afterwards mom told me and my younger brother to keep it a secret from dad. I remember other instances of mom having me and my brother in the car when she went to pick up men I didn't know and bringing them home.

&#x200B;

I don't know how much time passed but I remember dad asking me if any strange men came over the house at night saying that my brother told him about them. I immediately lied to my dad and told him that I've never seen any strange men around and that my brother was making things up.  Nothing else happened after that and my dad eventually got a new job that didn't require as much travel.

&#x200B;

I feel guilty for what I did but am too afraid to ask my mom about it. Its been over fifteen years since then and my mom and dad seem to be happily married. I have a younger brother still in school and I don't want to break up the family over something that might not even be real.  I feel guilty and hurt because my dad has always treated me with love and support and no differently than how he treats his real sons. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that if he ever found out he would cut me out of his life, which is stupid I know, I mean I was only a little kid but still.

&#x200B;

I try to rationalize keeping it a secret thinking that maybe he already knew since the suspicion was there and maybe they had worked it out behind the scenes when I was still an ignorant school kid. So talking about it would only bring back painful memories.

&#x200B;

I just really hate my mom sometimes and get these angry suspicions that she is still cheating when there is no evidence of it, but I hide it well. I blame her for my fear of being cheated on, but I still love her. So I just keep it inside.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for your kind words. I was really afraid I would just see a bunch of posts shaming my mom and calling her names, which is not what I wanted to see.  I know what she did was awful but I still love her.",4357

So my first memory of sexual assault/molestation was not really anything direct but I had this friend all through grade school who was always really weird and ended up being suicidal in middle school, etc. (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to downplay that because I am [REDACTED_NAME] I get mental health struggles but that's just a huge side note). Not your run of the mill person. Anyways, I remember on a couple occasions we would play in the snow outside as kids (I don't have a concept of how old I was but I was definitely less than 8 or 9) and she would have my lay down in the snow and she would pile snow on my chest area and my private area and then pat it down which really made me uncomfortable. She would always say something like she was making me into a mermaid but now when I think of it I remember how uncomfortable I was. That's kind of a short story and because it's so far back in my memories I can't really remember all the details or come up with any concrete evidence. 

Story number two: just a detail, NOT non-consensual anything. My best friend and I used to make out all the time in grade 4, and I distinctly remember it was because we wanted to practice kissing and were curious. Both of us were very okay with it and we got touchy feely with each other but it would always stop and then we'd just go to sleep. Everything seemed normal.

Story number three: another detail. At some point when I was around 10 - 12 (!?) I somehow discovered pornography on the internet and I knowingly became addicted to it for a while before I realized what was happening and then tried to stop (after a while I was successful). This was very unusual for me--I was really the model responsible older sibling, girl-next-door type. 

Story number four... I have a kid brother and we used to like to have sleep overs with each other which was never anything sexual. My family is just generally touchy and we like to snuggle. This was around the time I discovered the pornography. On one specific night sometime when he must have been around 2 years old or so, my sexual curiosity (or whatever the fuck was/is/was (????) wrong with me) led me to mess around with him by touching his penis and beginning to engage in oral but then I remember thinking ""what the fuck am I doing???"" and then I stopped. I felt icky and gross and when I think about it now I feel icky and gross. He was so little I honestly don't know or don't think he remembers this at all. I wasn't thinking at all when I was doing it and I was somehow dissociating. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] afraid that one day he will remember and he will hate me for it (he and I are very close to this day) or that it will have longterm effects on his quality of life and mental health. The other issue with this situation is that currently my career revolves around working with children. I am [REDACTED_NAME] that if I tell my therapist about this, she will have to tell someone and I won't get approved for my mandatory police checks. To make it ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, I do NOT have sexual thoughts or desires or ANYTHING for children or minors or anything. This incident with my brother happened ONCE and I believe it was due to his innocence and my curiosity, NOT because he was underage or anything like that. I KNOW it was wrong. I knew that right after I did it. I feel horrible about it and I can't erase it from my memory. I don't know what got into me or what was wrong with me as a child that led to this happening, but something was and there's no taking back what happened. 

Story number five... I had a friend in middle school who I would have sleep overs with and we did some kissing on our sleepovers but nothing like the friend in grade 4. It quickly ended. One night I recall wanting to make out with her but I was afraid to express my feelings so I tried to cuddle up to her once we had turned out the lights, etc. and put my hand on her hip and tried to kiss her but then nothing happened so I just rolled back over and tried to go to sleep. I am [REDACTED_NAME] certain she was in shock and just pretended to be asleep and I have reason to believe that she remembers that to this day. She told everyone at school that I was a lesbian and I was bullied for that (fair enough). Again, I feel very remorseful about this now. I wish I could take that back, I don't know what was wrong with me, I don't know what I was thinking in that moment. As with most instances like these, I am [REDACTED_NAME] certain that she remembers. It is killing me to know that I potentially have had a longterm effect on someone's self confidence and mental health and future sexual experiences. We haven't really talked since that day. 

Interjection - over time I forgot about these instances, pushing them to the very back of my brain because, despite being the violator (in the case of my stories 4/5), it did cause me some sort of irreparable trauma. I did not start to remember them until about a year ago. 

Story number six... I was victim to statutory rape when I was 14 or 15. Basically I was very naive and allowed someone who had just turned 18 to seduce me and convince me to meet up with him in dark school hallways after hours to make out, etc. Up until this point any male attention I had received was from guys telling me that I was fat or stupid or gross. Then, having this older and very attractive person show his attraction and compliment me in these ways was a novelty. I couldn't believe that someone would ever think of me in that way. The first time we met (before we had actually been introduced) he came up behind me and wrapped his hands around my waist. Now I recognize that his actions were completely abnormal. The first time we kissed (also my first kiss), he brought me into a dark hallway telling me he'd buy me a can of pop, which he did but then he set it down and I asked him what he was doing, and he pinned me to the wall and started to make out with me and feel me up. I should clarify that this man was very very strong as he was a gymnast and I certainly was not. He was able to hold both my arms down with one hand. On one hand in my head this was logically what any girl could dream of, on the other my gut feeling was telling me to run. I was in shock and did nothing. I stupidly agreed to meet with him again and again wherein similar things would happen until one day he forced me give him oral and then proceeded to have sex with me but I froze up because it was my first time and I didn't know what to do. I feel like part of this whole thing was my fault for never saying ""stop"" or ""no"" but also because he had no reason to believe that I wasn't into it... Also the icing on the cake was that I found out the day he met me was the day after his girlfriend had dumped him and she went to the same school so basically I was unknowingly his rebound and arm candy. 

Story number seven... The last story basically led to a downwards spiral in me believing that (1) sexual favours and acts were the only way to ever achieve any level of intimacy with someone and that (2) my role as a sexual object was the only value that men would see in me. While I had a lot of ""consensual"" sex (I'll do it because I know you will like me if I do) throughout the remainder of high school and at the beginning of university, I was not 'actually' sexually assaulted until I was in my first long term relationship. Basically I started seeing this guy right after I started university and this led to us finally moving in together after only a few months of dating and then a common law marriage for several years. At first, I was really turned on by him and we had a lot of very good consensual sex. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] exactly sure where the turning point was, but about halfway through our relationship I stopped wanting to have sex with him all the time. Both he and I interpreted this as me being unfaithful or me being lazy or me not wanting to hold up ""my end"" of the relationship. Note: if you are with the right person or a respectful human being at all, sex doesn't need to be a tit for tat situation. Anyhow, no matter what the excuse, it had something to do with what was wrong with ME, and never anything about him or us. I realize now that it was probably because he was very manipulative and controlling and emotionally abusive, which caused me to fall out of love with him and thus no longer be sexually attracted to him simply as part of my innate reaction. Then there was a definite turning point. One morning he tried to wake me up with sex. I am [REDACTED_NAME] grumpy in the morning. I didn't want to do anything and he took great personal offence to it. We went on with our day but he brought it up later and we had a giant fight about it. Basically I finally gave in and said fine, have sex with me then, so he did but basically I just felt dead inside the whole time. From then on, whenever he wanted to have sex I would just go along with the motions and just feel dead inside. I would dissociate and think of anything besides what was happening to me physically and he would just get off and then I'd go on with my day as though nothing had happened. This happened for a long time before I realized the relationship wasn't healthy and I left. I hadn't left before because he was suicidal and every time our relationship grew thin he would threaten to kill himself or say he wouldn't survive without me. You can see why I couldn't just walk away.

Story number eight... After this relationship I had a lot of tinder sex with similar circumstances; I would use it as a way to get men to like me because I felt there was nothing else they could possibly want me for. Because of this a lot of the instances were barely consensual. However, there was one that was 100% not consensual and was most DEFINITELY rape. I met this guy, he was really really nice and normal and we were getting along really well. We went for coffee and even the barista said we were cute together. Then we went for dinner because we spent so long talking we skipped dinner... He was respectful of my eating habits and food choices and we talked more and more. Finally it came time to bid our goodbyes and he offered me a ride home. I took the ride and when he got to my place he parked and kind of made it clear that he wanted to come in. I'm a pushover so I didn't bat an eye despite knowing exactly where this was going. Now, you must know that this came at a time that I had started to be ok with being single and started to see my dating patterns and how it was harmful. I had decided that I didn't want any more hookups but that I wanted to keep dating people. I figured this would weed out the assholes from the good people based on who would or wouldn't wait for me. Anyways, he came into my place and we chatted for a while and started watching a movie (I can't even remember which one) and then we started kissing and I stopped and told him that I didn't want to go any further. I explained my situation fairly clearly. He kept saying things like ""oh come on, you know you want to,"" etc. I got up and went to the washroom because I was angry. I stood in there for a while with the door closed because I didn't know what to do. I was trying to decide if I'd just let him do it and get it over with (sad but true) or if I'd shut it down. I came back out and he was in my bedroom. He put his arms around me and I told him again what I had said before. When I looked up at him (he was quite tall) he grabbed my face and started making out with me. He forced his disgusting tongue in my mouth and then shoved me onto the bed and started to do everything else that I can barely bring myself to type let alone think. Anyways basically it was very very very rough. It was very painful. I froze up again and did nothing, I just let him flop me around like a rag doll. I had some cuts the next day from where he had pulled at my skin and it broke because of the pressure. I also had bruises. What hurt me the most was that it was the first time I had the bravery to say no and it didn't work. This was in September or October. It is now February. 
Something very similar happened again a few weeks later with a different guy but it wasn't as bad and he could tell something was wrong because it was the first time since that time (^) and I started shaking halfway through and going into shock. He didn't have bad intentions. He was just naive. When I started shaking he stopped. 



What kills me the most about all of this is that I know I have inflicted the feelings I had on many occasions upon two other human beings. Has anyone else out there been abused but also the abuser? How do I understand these things in my adult consciousness when I know they happened as a child? How do I tell my brother? Do I ever tell him? What if I lose my job? This is my entire career that I have worked very hard to build and love with all my heart. I would have to start from ground zero for something that happened when I was a child myself and which I have NO residual desires or ANYTHING of the sort from. Can anyone offer any advice? Do you know about any laws regarding being an underage offender and what your rights are as an adult? I do not pose any threat to a child. I know that for myself. :'( I feel like that was an entirely different person from who I am [REDACTED_NAME]. It is more of a vignette in my mind than a memory. I am [REDACTED_NAME] shock and disbelief about my own actions. 

Also how do you guys (rape/sexual abuse victims) deal with instances such as those where there was never any official saying ""no"" or ""stop""? Does this still count as rape? Sigh. :/// ",11

I used to go out and play at the park at the end of my street, all the kids did the same who lived around there. We were allowed out after school until the street lights come on and that meant we had to head home. 

One evening in the summer, I was at the park alone, three older girls who I sort of knew (sisters of friends and their friends) they were 16 and 17, come up to me and started talking, I was young and thought they were pretty. I can’t remember what they asked me about but I do remember one thing specifically, the oldest of the girls asked me to get my penis out and show them.

She said that they would all kiss me if I took off my clothes, and so I did. 

One of them did give me a kiss on the lips, I thought I would like it but it was terrifying. One of them took a photo of me and was making lewd comments that I barely understood, the tone was really uncomfortable. I have always wondered what happened with that picture. It makes me feel sick. I put my clothes back on and went home. I’ve never told anyone, friends or family about this. 

I have had issues with letting people close to me ever since. It has been an incredibly lonely 17 years. 

(I have had relationships in my adult life, I’m 27 now and the dating pool is fucked up as it is, so addressing my intimacy and trust issues always ends things early.  Women just think I’m frigid, I’m not, ofc I love sex. I just can’t find the words to communicate what I need from them for me to be comfortable.) ",876
1jum9yq,1744140581.0,2025-04-08 19:29:41,confession,My weight loss wake up call was seeing how ugly my sister is,"I'm [REDACTED_NAME], as you can garner from the title. I've been trying to lose weight for years now, and while I have had some results, I am [REDACTED_NAME] technically clinically obese, though not morbidly.

My sister is also obese, but is closer to morbidly obese than I am. Yesterday, I went on Instagram and her profile popped up, so I decided to scroll through it since I haven't seen her in almost 5 years and don't really look at my family members' social media. As I was scrolling, I came across one of her selfies and was hit with the realization that her face is my face. I had never realized just how similar we looked, but her selfie was the same face I see in the mirror everyday, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I know it sounds awful, but my sister has always been the ugliest of the kids in my family, so realizing I look at all like her is not particularly pleasant.

I realized that one of the reasons we look so similar was because of our face shape, very round and pudgy. Seeing her and realizing how ugly I think she is and realizing how similar we look has given me extreme motivation to lose the weight and keep it off. I can't do anything about our facial features without surgery, but hopefully by losing weight I will be able to think that we look different and won't feel so awful about my appearance. 

Anyway, I know that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] awful sister for saying so bluntly that I think my sister is actively ugly, but it's true. And it's not just her face, she also doesn't take care of herself, has hair that's been overdyed and is stringy and gross now, and recently got several face piercings (you can have your own opinion, but I think they're ugly 99% of the time). I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to see her in just over a year, so I really need to lose the weight by then for fear that anyone will comment on how similar we look.",23231

And he assumed I took it. 

Since that moment, I've stole from the school store every opportunity I could because I was never given my money back. I became Judge, Jury, and Executioner and I feel no pity for the erasers I took.

I was in hospital for three days not expected to leave alive, but I did.

I have permanent amnesia.  I lost every personal memory I had, I don’t even remember my mother’s face, hell I didn’t recognise my own face.  Anything before 2009 is sketchy at best.

It took five years to come to terms with the new reality, and the realisation that I had lost the ability to feel fear due to my amygdala being permanently damaged.  I had lost the emotional connection with my now ex-wife.

Losing an emotion has left me feeling that I am [REDACTED_NAME] longer human.  A person who can’t feel fear is a monster.  There are less limits on doing anything, which is not as good as it sounds.  Physically I am [REDACTED_NAME], but losing that emotion has made the other emotions I have left, heightened.

Love is extreme, but so is anger, I take great efforts to avoid hate, because I don’t know how I could stop it.  Anger is almost impossibly to come down from.

When I am [REDACTED_NAME] I see red, i can hear the blood rushing in my ears, I feel like I am [REDACTED_NAME] to explode, and it takes an extreme effort to suppress that rage.  I will usually sit quietly gripping a desk, or squeezing my fists, until I can get to a level of control.

for those saying I deserve the same treatment....I was literally 5. I never actually harassed or anyhting I would just refuse to be 'friends' with her. It was the other kids who actually 'bullied' her. I know staying silent when I know it's wrong isn't better but cmon I was literallly a kid.",1296

&nbsp;

From as far back as I remember until I was about 14 I had a very stressful home life. I feel like I may have been abused (I remember everything that happened,so this isn't a recovered memories situation), but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure because 1.the rest of my family never did anything. They even told me I was the lucky one(mom acknowledged my brothers being verbally and physically abused-I was verbally and physically -I think- by both parents and I think sexually by my father), 2.my parents still speak to me and expect contact as if nothing ever happened, 3.I always felt like I was making a big deal of things or making things up 4. I think my bf knows The details from reading stuff I wrote and sometimes references me being ""kind of"" abused. I refrain from talking about it with therapists or anyone really because I feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and these things have hurt me very deeply for years, which I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of being judged on. I did go to a therapist for a later situation, which I didn't even delve into and my therapist said to not feel bad because I'm [REDACTED_NAME]; some of her patients experienced satanic ritual abuse. So if someone hadn't even heard my story,which I already think isn't a big deal but makes me feel awful-and said that, what will they say when I actually do tell them?

&nbsp;

Firstly, my dad had issues with my weight and would call me names and weighed me constantly. This developed into an eating disorder by the time I was 12. My mom also called me names, but more explicit names like ""slut"",""bitch"",""evil"",""whore"", etc. and would constantly yell at me angrily and ask things like,""What? Do you feel dirty because your dad touches you?"" Awful,ridiculous things like that. I sometimes feel the damage my mom inflicted has cut me deeper than the possible damage she was speaking of. In the meantime she'd shun me because ""your brothers and I have horrible lives with your father and he treats you like a princess."" I was not allowed to feel sad or express any sort of negative emotion at all because they had things worse and I should be happy because my dad was nice to me and gave me attention and spoiled me. 

&nbsp;


The first incident I told my mom about,rather confidently, my older brother said didn't happen. I thought that perhaps I had over analyzed the situation. For that incident, I was 6 and already afraid of my dad (due to him cornering me, manhandling me, pinning me to floors and walls, forcing me to do loads of things like kisses that made noise,sitting with him without leaving, tickling past the point where I couldn't breathe, letting him touch my legs, bare butt, etc. And my mom and grandparents constantly saying he was sick and asking me if he'd ever done anything-though of course when I told my mom, my brother denied and then later my mom would sit next to us and say nothing). Because I was afraid of him, maybe I over analyzed the situation. 
&nbsp;

I dropped a remote or toy into the couch (which had springs so if stuff fell, it'd go onto the floor under the couch), bent over to get it and felt someone large-obviously my dad, suddenly on top of me. I tried to get out from under him but he pushed down and taunted me about not being able to get away. I remember him rocking and taunting me and then my brother came downstairs and he got off and laughed. I assumed that he ""humped"" me,so that's what I told my mom. My mom and grandparents always said to tell them if he ever did anything-like constantly they'd say it, but then I did and my brother said that wasn't what happened. So maybe it wasn't then. But I don't understand an adult male doing things like that regardless and poking fun at a little kid feeling helpless and trapped. 

&nbsp;

I was a really lonely kid and would spend a lot of time outdoors by myself. One day, my dad snuck up behind me, grabbed me and put his hand over my face. My heart sunk, but I kicked behind me. He put me down in front of him and said ""that's what happens when you act stupid"". My dad was obsessed with kidnap/rape stories,always made me watch them and said that's what would happen to me if I keep acting stupid (shy and naive,basically).

&nbsp;

Besides that, there was a nightly ritual of him coming home and calling me or dragging me downstairs to sit with him. Originally I remember just doing it, but I couldn't stand being unable to escape so around 9 or so I started trying to resist,hiding,etc. I don't even know where to start. I'd go downstairs and he'd be watching E! or like Howard Stern. I didn't like watching that because I thought the things he'd have the girls on his show do were degrading and a lot of it was explicit. He'd playfully tell me to watch it and tell me I was being ridiculous if I said I didn't like that show. He'd specifically point out if tits or something were out and say things like ""isn't she pretty? Wouldn't you like her as your mom?""(He'd do this to waitresses and stuff too-if this happened to you, my child self apologizes for my and all creepy AF dads).

&nbsp;

I felt really uncomfortable because I knew that I shouldn't be watching stuff like that. My mom was aware, i would complain, but she didn't do anything. I thought again, maybe he was right, maybe I was being ridiculous. 

&nbsp;

I'd sit there and meanwhile he'd have his hands on my thighs which would always inevitably go up under my underwear and onto my butt. I was hyperaware, so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure nothing ever touched my vagina. With my family constantly questioning, my mom constantly sexually berating me, and these things with my dad, I was afraid every day that that would be the day he'd rape me. I remember a journal I had when I was 9 and 10, writing that I wished he'd either just get it over with or leave me alone. I can put this into words better now as an adult than I could then, so the best way I can explain is that I was tired of feeling like I was being foreplayed. I was scared and felt terrorized; he'd already shown me that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] strong enough and I have to listen to everything or risk passing out from over tickling-literally, any other adult that would tickle me would do it until I said to stop. I'd beg my dad and start crying and yelling in between involuntary laughter and he wouldn't stop until I'd do whatever he was trying to make me do, not until I couldn't breathe or started crying or screaming. I knew there was nothing I could do if it happened and I felt like it was going to.

&nbsp;

I tried to mentally prepare myself every day for when I'd inevitably end up with him and the possibilities of what could happen because I knew no one would protect me. I feel like writing that, I had to either be a huge pervert or ..i don't even know. Maybe he did want to. But maybe he just thought it was fun to get a reaction out of the quiet,shy kid.

&nbsp;

I also became hypersexual by the time I was 7. I remember my mom reprimanding me when she found out(I had no idea that masturbating in front of other people was wrong-looking back I was a smart kid and otherwise socially aware so idk why I would do something like that). She asked why and was really grossed out and my response was literally just ""because it feels good"" and she said to just not do it. I have no idea if that's normal, but I've always been embarrassed about not realizing that it was inappropriate to do in front of other people. Luckily I think it was only in front of my much older teenage brother who was just like ""wtf are you doing?"" and I think he was the one to tell her.

&nbsp;


Anyway, so with the nightly things were forcing me to kiss him(I never did on the mouth), forcing me to sit with him where he'd grope,rub,or otherwise be fondling my butt and inner thighs, shaking his leg while I was on it (could very well be innocent), etc. I had to kiss him repeatedly until I did it perfectly. If I didn't do it ""right""(could be the sound wasn't right or something) he'd demand again, if I refused, he'd tickle me way past the point where i coudln't breathe. I began punching at him when I was around 9 and he thought it was funny and would start getting really forceful back; he'd usually grab my arms and tickle me or put me in some hold and say things like ""What do you think you're stronger than me?"" If I'd get away, he'd chase me,grab me and pin me to the ground or walls,lay on top of me and force me to kiss him. I remember being held really tightly face down once after trying to get away, just shutting my brain down and feeling his gross,clammy chest on my face while he was tracing my thighs/ass.

&nbsp;

My mom was always home when this stuff happened, but when I would yell for help no one came. I'd go ask her why she didn't help and she'd say it sounded like I was enjoying the attention(due to involuntary laughing/gasping for breath from being tickled for long periods of time if I refused something). I assumed I was overreacting.

&nbsp;

He'd make crude comments to me about ""eating"" me out when I was 12 and when I'd respond with disgust he'd say ""you'd like it."" I always thought he just had a severe disdain for women and I happened to unfortunately be female. I didn't really know what oral sex was until my teens, so I didn't fully understand what he was saying.

&nbsp;

He'd walk past me and whistle and smack or grab my butt all the time. I always thought that was awkward, so you could imagine my surprise the first time he did that in front of one of his friends. I was always embarrassed to have my friends over because if he was home and wanted my attention, I'd end up on his lap involuntarily laughing,gasping for air,and shouting to no one for help. I felt really embarrassed about having my butt groped,being forced to kiss him, having him on top of me, having his hands down my underwear. I still feel really embarrassed. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] for being upset about something possibly so trivial and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] embarrassed about partaking in things that I felt were sexual and weird. 

&nbsp;

 Only once, when 2 male friends visited when I was 12 did I feel some validation: we were on the computer in the dining room and he told me to turn the game off and go outside. I said ok. My friends wanted to do one more thing and save(this was also back on like Windows 98), so I let them. He came back in about 2 minutes later, saw the computer wasn't off, yelled to turn it off and smacked me hard on the cheek. My older friend was like ""that's child abuse, don't hit her!"" This stuff happened constantly but my mom always said I was the only one who was treated well by my dad, so I shoved my feelings down when I felt bad about something that I perceived to be bad or mean happening to me. This also caused me to be severely bullied in grade school. I had one particular girl twist my arms, sit on me, push my face into gravel and punch my head at recess every day until I begged to be pulled out of school.

&nbsp;

When I was 9, I remember showering and my dad coming in and opening the curtain. I had a feeling this would happen, so I squatted down to cover everything(I grew boobs at 8) and he just stared down at me like I was being ridiculous, snickered and walked away. 

&nbsp;

At 13, I had to go see him for a weekend and once in the car he said we were going to the south (we live up north US). My mom had given me a phone but he took it from me and headed to the airport. On the way there he was touching my thighs and every time I'd take his hand off he'd just go higher and tell me to stop being ridiculous. At one point it was up near my pelvis. I felt helpless because I didn't feel like I had a say in anything, I thought I was being kidnapped, thought he was getting way too close to my privates and now my only connection to anyone else was gone. I just kind of shut down. We got to the airport and just ended up picking up a friend of his. So all that stuff about going on a trip was just to get me upset.

&nbsp;


When I ended up with a full blown eating disorder and In the hospital for a suicide attempt at 16, my mom called me evil and a slut(I'd never had a boyfriend). I OD'd on diet pills at some point, started vomitting and asked to please go to the hospital and she said I disgusted her and locked me out of her room. At this point, we had lived separately from my dad for 4 years but I still had to visit him every weekend. But everything stopped at 14. He started dating someone and stopped even calling. 

&nbsp;

After the OD and 2nd hospitalization, my mom ""wiped her hands clean"" of me and it was agreed that i would go live with my dad. He had been married for a few months at that point. Things felt normal. Oddly, when his new wife or my (younger) step brothers would watch X rated stuff, he'd put his hands over my eyes. It was so weird. Then I started really feeling crazy. He was suddenly acting like a good dad. He gave me privacy, had boundaries, and was overall just like a good dad. I don't understand why or what happened. I've broken contact with him several times over the past decade but every time I talk with him again he seems pretty normal, albeit a little immature. He was recently dating a girl younger than me (early 20's), which was really gross, but that's about it.

&nbsp;

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should have contact with him or not. My mom as well. I don't know if they forget, if I overexaggerated, or if they think I forgot. I feel really conflicted about speaking with them though. I don't know whether to be angry with them or myself. Since my childhood, I've been assaulted by 4 different guys. One was my boyfriend, who I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with. He raped me for 2 years, continued assaulting me for 1, and physically and mentally abused me for the remainder. I originally stayed because outside of ""sex"", I enjoyed his company and was otherwise lonely.

&nbsp;

I recently went to my primary care doctor and she asked a few questions and came to the conclusion that I need to break up with my bf. He moved us away from my mom's place which was intensely emotionally abusive. He hadn't abused me in years and told me not to work and focus on healing for as long as it took(was diagnosed with PTSD in 2013). He started physically abusing me again at some point,after years of promising never again. My doctor was urging me to see a therapist to find my self esteem and be able to leave him and finally escape all of this. I recently did accept a job and applied to college-somewhat because I've been suicidal and want to be better, I want to be self reliant, and somewhat because I know I need an escape plan if I decide to leave. I want to be able to rely on myself alone, I should have never trusted anyone.

&nbsp;

My doctor asked if I was sexually abused as a kid, I said I think so and she was telling me how I might accept this sort of relationship because of what I've learned, and might be scared that someone out there could hurt me worse. That's true. I also just discovered my bf cheating for the past 3 years at least, or trying to find people at least, and now I feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to be able to trust anyone at all with anything. I can't imagine having friends or a new partner ever again, because it's too frightening to not know if someone might hurt me. But I'm [REDACTED_NAME], so I settle for the comfort of knowing I'll be hurt and not having to wonder. 

&nbsp;

That appointment really shook me up because I think she's right. But I don't know if I was abused because of all of the conflicting things such as my parents acting ""normal"" now, my dad since my later teens, and all of the messages I received as a kid.

&nbsp;

The worst part is that yes mom, I feel dirty and ashamed of myself for everything that I've involuntarily partaken in. I feel awful about myself, I don't feel like my body is my own, I don't feel like my life is my own. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my late 20s and I look like a child, act like a child, and feel like a child. I feel gross and perverted, I feel like an outsider, I don't feel like there's anywhere I belong. I don't feel like I fit anywhere. But I don't even know if I feel this way because anything was really wrong or if I feel this way because I've overexaggerated things. 

&nbsp;

Am I overreacting? Did I cause my own ""trauma"" by overthinking things? If I go to a therapist and talk about this, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] terrified that they're just going to laugh and say I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Because then the issue is fully my own sick mind.

c60wpy,1561609184.0,2019-06-27 04:19:44,confession,I made up the suicide of a friend for attention,"Usually I just lurk around Reddit. I've made a few posts, but there's no need for a throwaway because nobody knows my account. There isn't a day in my life that goes by where I don't regret doing this, so I just need a place to vent.

Some context: I had a relationship with a long-time friend, Tom. We started out as just being friends, but it turned out we both liked each other so we kinda just said ""fuck it"" and started a relationship together. At the time, we were both depressed and suicidal (we both had to go to the psychiatric ward for a while for that sorta thing). I was mentally unhealthy and sought attention in incredibly unhealthy ways, but this one takes the cake. 

So one day, Tom and I were having a conversation, I can't remember how it really went, but the suicide of one of his best friends came up (he was an online friend whom Tom would often play video games with). He was very sensitive because it had happened pretty recently. I was a little taken aback. I could never imagine losing a close friend to suicide: the guilt, the loss, the emptiness. I haven't even had any real loss that I've had to go through thus far. But my attention-seeking ass wanted to relate to him, wanted to direct the conversation towards me, wanted to make it seem like I was a better person because I understood what it felt like, to lose a friend. So I said something like ""Oh my god, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sorry that happened. Something like that happened to me, with one of the people I used to play games with. His name was Kite."" And just like that, I distracted him from his mourning and directed the attention onto me. I didn't even fucking wince, I thought nothing was wrong with it. I thought I could be a support system for him, but I was literally doing the opposite, making him spend more time on me than his emotional processing of his own trauma. 

So the next few months I kind of just roll with the lie. I knew it was fucked up, it was wrong, that I should confess or at least just not talk about it anymore, but I didn't. It's not like it came up every day, but when it did, I always tried to relate with him with my fantasy experiences with Kite. Sometimes, when I was feeling really down and I felt like Tom was ignoring me, I'd message him with something like ""God I really miss Kite rn :("" and he'd be sure to message back. I did stuff like that a few times to grab his attention. I remember one day I was curious of how the events went down for his friend who had passed. He is very closed off about that sort of thing, and it's very hard to get him to talk about trauma in his life. Obviously he didn't want to talk to me about his friend, so I fabricated a story of my own for Kite. I said he sent me a suicide note, but I was in the middle of a game and didn't check my messages until later, but I could have stopped him, I could have stopped him, I failed. I told Tom that since I told my story about Kite, he should tell his story about his friend. So he did. He didn't give many details, but I basically guilted him into sharing a traumatic experience with me with a make-believe ""traumatic"" experience of my own. 

That shit went on for months before I made a suicide attempt and went to the hospital (don't worry, the suicide attempt was partially for attention too, and I wasn't in any real danger). Ended up having to go to a mental hospital acute counseling unit for a few weeks. Couldn't really contact Tom, but while I was in there I met some amazing people that helped me with my attention-seeking, my self hatred, my self harm, all those sorts of things. I knew it was fucked up to lie to Tom and manipulate him like that, so the first thing I did when I was out of the unit was visit Tom and tell him the truth. He didn't really react, he just kind of said ""Oh."" and we kept talking about my experience in the hospital. I was glad he didn't make a big deal out of it, I was like ""Oh shit that was easy!"" 

It came back to bite me in the butt the second time I was in the hospital. When I got out, he was quick to call out all the bullshit I had dragged him through and promptly broke up with me. At the time I was like ""W-wha?! How could he! What a dick!"" But now, six months after the breakup, I applaud him for the fucking courage to do that to my abusive ass. Thank you for getting out of that situation, Tom. You made me realize how much of a bitch I was. I'd like to think I'm [REDACTED_NAME] emotionally abusive now. But yeah, I haven't really told anyone else that I did this and I just want to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading, I know this was a long ass post. I kind of want to get back in touch with him, not to start any romantic stuff again, but to know how he's doing. Do you guys think I should? 

TL;DR - Pretended I had a friend that committed suicide after my boyfriend of the time said he lost one of his best friends to suicide. Used it to emotionally manipulate him. He eventually realized my BS and got the hell out of the situation.",6
d4m9zx,1568562905.0,2019-09-15 15:55:05,confession,I slammed a kid's head into gravel when I was maybe 7,"Ok so, I used to ride the bus when I was in 5th grade, and in the morning, there was some other kids waiting for the bus as well, so this kid, his name will be frank for this, was really obnoxious and annoying, and he would intentionally get under your skin. So one day he decided to make fun of my last name, which most people thought was cool as hell, but he just wanted to be a prick. So I warned him to shut up, and he just kept going, and kept going, so I calmly walked over to him, and told him, ""I dare you to say it again"". He did, and I promptly yeeted his head into the thick gravel he was standing by, and it wasn't like normal gravel, it was basically rocks. I felt so satisfied, but now I'm [REDACTED_NAME], ""damn, I hope hes alright after that"" (P.S. I was actually 10 when this happened so dont keep correcting me please)",3621
1kyuhjc,1748576377.0,2025-05-30 03:39:37,confession,i had a random realization that i was SA’d as a child,"title is pretty self explanatory but i’m a 19f now and it was like a random slap in the face a couple days ago. i’ve always had this recurring dream of a memory from when i was 5 at a fundraising dinner for my school. i left my family’s table to explore the pretty banquet hall. i remember feeling like a princess in my dress and pretending i was in my own palace. 

a boy i knew from my bus who was in fifth grade was following me and i thought he was playing games with me and i remember running away to hide in a closet. the dream usually ends here but this time it kept going. 

i was in the dark room alone when he opened the door letting a small creek of light in and i remember how he looked at me before he grabbed my arms and held me down and lifted up my dress. you can imagine the rest from there but i woke up crying and having a panic attack at 3 am because all the memories rushed into me and i can completely remember the incident. this really made me realize that my brain was covering this up to protect me in some way my whole life and i don’t know what triggered it. i remember running to my mom screaming and crying after he let me go and her being so scared but i just told her that a boy hurt me because i didn’t know any better.

the mind is very scary but i’m okay and i am [REDACTED_NAME] now that the boy might have been sexually assaulted by someone and learned this behavior so i do feel bad for him too. this is all just so weird to me and i don’t know how to feel anymore. i don’t think i want to tell anyone

1hh9fpe,1734549899.0,2024-12-18 19:24:59,confession,marrying for money sucks and I do not recommend it,"Married a 40 year old when I was 19. Started dating when I was 17. Yes, it was gross but that's what happened. The only reason he married me is because I was hot. The only reason I married him is because he had money. I actually do have other redeeming characteristics but he married me because I was hot. I know this. Everyone knows this. It doesn't feel great but I can deal with it. We've been married 20 years. 4 kids. So we are stable and we have lots in common at this point. And we do love each other. But if I could go back and slap myself I would. 

What nobody tells you- or they try and you don't listen because you're a dumbass teenager- is that marrying like this means you will fucking owe him. For everything. Every goddamn day. Not just in the bedroom but in every other matter in your life. The stuff you never imagined someone else trying to decide for you. And you don't just owe him for the money. It's a lot heavier than that. He'll never say it out loud. But you'll know the deal. Fundamentally unequal. He'll pull rank at the most random times and it will make you feel like you're falling through the floor. 

I don't hate my life or anything. I accept that I made this bed and I have to lie in it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. My oldest daughter is two years younger than I was when I met my husband and I can't imagine. ",55515

So one day there was this guy that kept gawking at me that my friend group and I noticed. Eventually I got the idea to trick him. Told him to meet me in a certain spot at school and we would do stuff. When he did, my girlfriends and I were all there recording it on our phones, making fun of him. 

This is a memory I honestly wish I could forget, as I do not relate to the person I was at 15 whatsoever. Having moved on from my trauma and that toxic home situation, I have changed a great deal and I always try to be a very kind person. This still brings me guilt when I think about it, though.

I question the critical thinking of all of you if you genuinely think this one event sums me up as a person. If you don't see the takeaway about mental illness you probably have some work to do on yourself.

1j0n5ia,1740790072.0,2025-03-01 00:47:52,confession,Was naked at my friends party for his kid high on morphine,"In my late 20s and early 30s, I started making good money as a financial advisor, and it kinda led me into a bad crowd where we were drinking, doing blow, and it’s when I first got introduced to morphine. All while this happened, I started becoming more distant from my best friend, I’ll call him Ben. Anyways, Ben invites me to his 4-year-old daughter’s birthday party at his house. It was kinda an attempt to patch things up between us. The week I had was super long and stressful, and I had forgotten all about the party until I got a reminder from my phone. I was already with my other friends doing our usual thing when my buddy Chad got this new bottle of solution you take orally. I’d never tried it before, and nothing happened. I looked it up, and it said it was supposed to work in an hour, but nothing happened, so I assumed it was a dud. I Uber to Ben’s birthday party because I didn’t want to drive just in case it would affect me. As soon as I get to his house, it starts to creep up on me, and I’m feeling nice and relaxed, music sounds amazing, all that stuff. I had to go take a shit because it’s a common thing that happens to me when I take morphine. When I’m sitting on the toilet, that’s when it hits me like I got hit by a bus. My mouth is as dry as the fucking desert, my whole body is so nice and relaxed times 10. I’m not going to lie, it felt fucking amazing. In my head, I kept saying, “this is amazing, this is amazing,” over and over and over. I remember slumping the fuck over on the toilet and landing face-first on the bathroom floor. I don’t know how long I was lying there, but Ben’s wife knocks on the door and asked if I’m ok. I tell her I’m fine, but even saying it, I sound like an actual retard. I remember I’ve been in here for a while now, and it looks suspicious asf. My whole body feels heavy as shit, and I just want to lay down and enjoy my high. I try to stand up, but my legs are shaking like crazy, and it feels like I’m 2000 pounds. I manage to open the door after what felt like hours fumbling with the lock. I walk into the main room where everyone’s at. I remember the look of absolute horror on everyone’s face—Ben’s face, his wife’s, his parents, everybody. Me being high asf, I say, “What?” Ben says, “Pull your pants up, WTF are you doing?” I look down, and my dick is out. One of the little kids notices and just screams at the top of her lungs. Me being absolutely blasted, I say, “Shut up, you ole bitch” to a literal 5-year-old. I don’t really remember much after that. I just remember Ben taking me home, me begging him to take me to McDonald’s like a child and whining and crying when he didn’t, and him lecturing me about how much I changed and how much of a degenerate I’ve become. I feel absolutely horrible about ruining that girl’s birthday party, possibly traumatizing a bunch of kids, and having my best friend have to take care of me on a day he was supposed to remember fondly. I’m going to quit all drugs, try to make more meaningful relationships. I’ve apologized to Ben, but obviously, he doesn’t want to talk to me, which I understand. I just feel like the biggest scumbag ever.",13654

1xl2j3,1392092192.0,2014-02-11 04:16:32,confession,My Wretched Biography [tough love],"Its a long story so feel free to skim...


On the occasions when I reflect on my life, I realize how loathsome, perverse, wasted, and useless it has been that I marvel that I ever feel any joy or dignity in myself. The results of these reminiscences have burdened me with such unbearable feelings that I’m driven to write something about my life so far. This history will probably cause most readers (if there be any) to turn away with revulsion and disgust, yet I hope there will be at least some who while not sympathetic will at least be understanding.

I was born on the 12th of August in 1996, in what will most probably be remembered as the last few years of the post-war American consensus until the twin crisis of Islamist terrorism and the Great Recession struck in the first decade of new millennium. Of course, like everybody else, I have no memories of the early years of my life and have been forced to rely on my family for these facts. I had been born to parents who had been married but a few years before and they were relatively advanced in the years when they gave birth to me. From early on, an important development occurred that would affect my life even to this day. While my parents during this time lived in an apartment complex that stood roughly in the area that forms the borders between the cities of Costa Mesa and Newport Beach, my mother found herself unable to take care of me due to the necessity of working. So during the workweek I was cared for by my maternal grandmother in an apartment in Anaheim and it was only on Fridays that my mother would come to pick me up.

Of course, my parents knew this would not do and sought to find a daycare for me. Yet most of these attempts were highly unsuccessful. For example at one place I went to I got into conflict with my caretaker because I refused to eat the dish she served me and as a result she was trying to forcibly feed me when my aunt came, causing a great argument. At last, there was one location I went to for a few years but I never fit in there, constantly getting into conflict with my teacher there. It got so bad that at one point I punched her in the stomach and eventually she refused to have anything to do with me. I certainly didn’t make any close friends there, although there was a girl there who would be the first person I would develop a crush on-I believe her name was Laurie although I have been unable to locate her so far.

During this time, my parents moved into the same apartment complex as my grandmother (incidentally who lived there with my aunt) to order to make it easier for them to see me as my grandmother took care of me during the daytime. However, as a result of this I ended up living at my grandmother’s place more or less permanently. While I do not know the exact reasons why (although there probably were numerous factors such as my grandmother’s well-meaning doting and my Asperger’s), I never ended up becoming properly to take care of myself in several areas and thus my grandmother or some other adult would end up cleaning me after taking defecating help me shower, and put on clothes well into elementary school. 

Now the time came for me to go to elementary school and my parents decided that I should go to a school in Fountain Valley as it was both close to where my mother worked making it convenient for her to drop me off and because the schools were better in quality than those in Anaheim. It was here that I came to realize my utter social maladjustment. In first grade, I exhibited the first tendencies of what would probably end up becoming a long habit-that of meeting a certain child and becoming so attached to him or her as to end up being a nuisance and thus abandoned by that fellow. In addition, I would end up never developing any true friends in elementary or middle school due to this and other factors. Besides a few birthdays where virtually all kids in a class were invited, I never played with other kids outside of schools and similarly mandated settings. Starting in second grade, I found myself constantly getting into detentions-for example I got mocked by some kids for wearing “pajamas” and as a result I got into a fight with them. As a result of seeing these occurrences my teachers and other school officials began to suspect I might have Aspergers Syndrome.

As a result  I recall undergoing a battery of tests which ended up confirming their opinions. So I began to going to both “social skills” and “occupational therapy” sessions to improve both my behaviour and physical skills. I found these sessions to usually be great fun (at least I got some good snacks) but it appears that they did not improve me much. After about a year when I had been diagnosed, it was decided that I should transfer schools to attend a special education class.

At this point I should comment on my religious and sexual developments up to this point. My father was a Presbyterian and my mother (along with her family) was a Buddhist, which needless to say led to a haphazard development of my spiritual understanding. I recall learning a few Bible stories through picture books but was not baptized as an infant nor did I go to church. However at one point, I recall one of my aunts on my mother’s side (who had become a Baptist) trying to convert me through the story of the Noah’s Ark after I had been whining for a Happy Meal with Hot Wheels toy all day. This story only served to develop within me a strong fear of this story which I would have for years. I first began to go to church around first grade, initially attending both Korean school and the services for children. However after a few weeks, I refused to go to the latter out of an extreme fear of hearing the story about Noah’s Ark. My parents acquiesced, and as a result until 2009 I would not attend church services except on a couple of occasions. Instead I’d go with my mother to some unused room of the church (although even she insisted I should go to these services to get to know other children) or later on have my dad drive me to Border’s. The few times I attended a service was when my church had an annual picnic, for a wedding, and so forth. At the same time, I had even less conception of the ideas of Buddhism, although I enjoyed fidgeting and playing with the prayer beads to the extent that I asked it from my mother while my father was driving. Indeed, I think I can safely say that during this time I was basically an atheist when my thoughts ever turned to religion. 

Now as to my sexual development, both my fantasies and my behaviour were perverse. I think in this regard, the movie Batman and Robin appears to have played a great role as there is a scene in which Poison Ivy seduces and then kills a scientist. This was reflected in my fantasies (starting from about four or so) as most of them involved beautiful women seducing men and then killing them. While everybody tells me the Oedipus Theory has long been discredited, I am [REDACTED_NAME] so sure as these situations occasionally (mostly in my younger years) involved my mother and father or my aunt (aforementioned) and her husband. It should be noted, in this connexion, though that I had little idea of coitus and how that act engendered children. Instead my fantasies usually involved scantily-clad women in bikinis or lingerie, not fully naked on, and the acts were mostly kissing rather than actual sex. My behaviour was equally strange for I enjoyed rubbing my organs against a soft, yellow, vaguely phallic pillow. This utterly disgusting and shameful behaviour would go on into around fifth grade.

It was around third grade when my maternal uncle came to live with us at our house after his divorce. As a result of this he came into conflict with me because of my utterly undisciplined nature. With the exception of one timeout in second grade neither my grandmother nor my aunt nor my parents (when they were taking care of me) ever punished me in any serious sense. As a result I often did extremely depraved things-for example on a few occasions I used profanity on my elders or even pushed them. When my uncle saw this awful behaviour, he tried to physically punish me which led to conflict with my grandmother and aunt. A particularly bad incident occurred in the winter of 2007 when my uncle pulled my ear because I was not using proper honorifics to refer to older cousins of mine. So perverse and eager for revenge was I that I pulled his ear in response which caused him to hit me across the face and then threaten to kill me if I did it again. This unsurprisingly led to a huge argument between my mother, aunt, and grandmother against my uncle.

Returning to my school life, I would attend this special class I mentioned above for the last two years of elementary school. Even so, for some subjects (usually in the afternoon) I’d go to a normal class for my education. However on two occasions I was hit quite mildly by students in the class, which due to my cowardly and weak mien led me to cry uncontrollably. Another horribly embarrassing event occurred when I had accidentally missed the urinal and urinated all over my clothes instead. Nonetheless, it was during this time when I acquired at least some rudimentary social skills and began to do things such as defecating and washing by myself. 

About this time in fifth grade, I began to turn towards a vague sort of theism favourable to Christian ideas in the realm of religion, although I hardly understood the Gospel in its full. Meanwhile my mother had lost her job which would result in many years of my mother and I being driven around all over Orange County in search of a job. After I had that my parents prevailed upon the school district authorities to let me return to my old school for middle school (as it was K-8 rather than the usual K-5) rather than go to a larger middle school where I’d be placed in a special class just like at my new elementary school. This combined with my doing some basic hygienic activities for myself would mark the first steps in my long process of becoming socially normalized. It was during this period, that my other uncle (not the one mentioned above) died after a long and lingering illness. It was terrible for all my family and in particular for my grandmother. This was exacerbated due to various conflicts that erupted between members of my family (in particular my grandmother and aunt) and my uncle’s wife. For example my grandmother had been uttering various Buddhist prayers in the hospital room where my uncle lay and my uncle’s wife had screamed at her for doing so due to her Christianity. 

In middle school I was placed in normal classes, although once again I had to attend weekly social skills sessions. However despite my improvements in some areas, I still occasionally embarrassed myself (although this thankfully was mostly confined to my sixth grade year). For example, on one occasion I saw an acquaintance of mine write the word “fuck” on the playground blacktop with pretzel crumbs. I just laughed at it initially, but later on in class I received a detention for a reason that I’ve forgotten. I was so utterly filled with a sense of having been wronged and subjected to a double standard, that I reported my fellow student for doing the trivial offence I’ve mentioned above, although at least I had the dignity to do so in a private meeting with my teacher. 

While I became somewhat more acquainted with my peers in middle school then in elementary school, I did not develop any real friends with two exceptions. The first of these was a classmate of mine who one day in the spring of 2008 invited me to his sister’s birthday party. Soon enough he and I became close friends (or at least so I thought). We would meet up a couple of times over the next year to play video games and we had numerous conversations of a speculative nature. However, my unfortunate tendency of overattachment towards those who showed me friendship that I mentioned above asserted itself. By the spring of 2009 I was increasingly becoming a nuisance to him by following him everyday during recess and lunch in school. As a result while we never totally went separate ways, my interaction with him during eighth grade was far less frequent. My other friend was someone I met up at Sacramento where I was for the state round of the National Geography Bee. While we met at the state capital, I discovered that he resided nearby me in Fullerton. We would not have much interaction during the first year of our acquaintance but gradually we would end up meeting more and more.

It was during sixth grade that I developed one of my latest and worst tendency towards obsession. It had struck me at earlier ages with straightening slippers and a fear that I had developed AIDS. Then it had been the fear that the world and especially the universe would come to an end (as I read about the Big Crunch theory in a Peanuts science book). Then around fifth grade it had been the fear that I might unknowingly had been transported to an alternate universe with microscopic differences, which made obsessively look for any seemingly small alterations in my life. Now my obsessive behaviour displayed itself when I read. This began when I had been rereading HP Lovecraft’s “Call of Cthulhu” in sixth grade and noted that I did not recall some of the passages I saw there. The seeds of doubt planted here would made me unable on most occasions to progress appreciably when reading a text. I’d spend significant amounts of time rereading the same passage over and over again because I felt that I might have ignored a phrase or a word. Thus sometimes, I might only read a few pages a day. To someone who had previously enjoyed reading this was an agonizing development. Particularly humiliating was when I could not fill the easy page quotas for reading logs (and later Accelerated Reading quizzes) in English class while other children seemingly plowed through thousands of pages. At the same time, this tendency did not always manifest itself-when I was fairly unconscious of this disability of mine I could read at a fairly normal pace. Nonetheless I read incredibly little from that point on and I was always embarrassed when my parents boasted how much I enjoyed reading or when my acquaintances marvelled at how many tomes I had gone through. However due to my fairly large base of already existing knowledge and my tendency to skim through texts, I still learned enough to be at least nominally a capable student. 

My abandonment of reading was exacerbated by the acquisition of a computer. I would spend hours on computer doing the most useless activities such as paging through hundreds of book descriptions on Amazon (despite in all probability not being able to finish these books even if I acquired them) or debating topics I barely knew on multiple Internet forums. A particularly notorious debate was when I debate a Stalin apologist regarding the tyrant’s atrocities on RevLeft forum although all I knew about Stalin was from a juvenile biography of him from years before and facts I quickly Google-searched to back myself up. I became particularly involved on an Alternate History forum and Straight Dope Message Board where I would peddle ignorant, populist conservatism of the worst sort with a particular obsession on the issue of abortion. In fact due to a post denouncing abortion on StarDestroyer BBS in the summer of 2010 I earned the label “Fundamentalist Moron”. Starting in the fall of 2009, after my banning from AH Com, I’d further waste my time by trolling that website with numerous sockpuppet accounts. This awful wasteful habit would continue even to this day, as I’d spent hours browsing through old discussions or lists rather than finishing an assignment.

The computers also contributed to a particularly humiliating stage in my sexual life. Having abandoned the previously perverse behaviour of rubbing my crotch against various spots, starting in sixth grade I had begun to simply touch myself in bed at night. I also began looking at pictures and videos of bikini-clad women, starting with the Sport Illustrated Swimsuit Issue but also some Japanese gravure idols. However at the start of seventh grade, my obsessive tendency displayed in this regard. After reading an erotic story online I had checked my underwear for some reason and found that there drabbles of ejaculate on it. Following that incident, for about a year I would constantly wash myself and change my underwear whenever I looked at arousing pictures and found that my underwear had ejaculate on it. Indeed I did not masturbate in this period but rather just watched materials until I would orgasm and ejaculate myself in my underwear and pants. It was not until a year later that this behaviour of mine ended. Of course I also had a couple of wet dreams during this period which was particularly unfortunate for one reason. 

This was because not only was I living with my grandmother and aunt but due to the lack of space actually sleeping in the same bed with them. While usually I had at least separate sheets, this was not the case on a few occasions in winter when I my grandmother and I shared bedsheets. Indeed I cannot be certain whether or not had a wet dream during one of these occasions which fills me with incredibly disgusted and haunting feelings. Added to this is the certainty that either my mother or grandmother probably handwashed my underwear… After eighth grade my sexual behaviour normalized as I practiced regular masturbation, which of course continues the sin of lust in my life. 

The remainder of my middle school years proceeded well enough as I got decent grades (partially at the driving of my father) and I got along with most children most of the time. I began to interact with children besides the one I mentioned earlier and got to know them fairly well even if I seemed bizarre and annoying to them. In addition in my eighth grade year I would mean another lad who would become one of my close friends. He was in the sixth grade and we had both run for office in the Student Council elections. Initially he had mocked me for having Asperger’s (which some acquaintances of mine had apparently told him and which was an accurate assessment) but it appears eventually those acquaintances of mine thankfully retracted that announcement and I began conversing with him a lot. As a result he would join the relatively small ranks of those who were my friends. Also in relation to my Aspergers Syndrome, I finally got completely placed off the “special education” program in the spring of 2010, and thus I no longer had to attend the social skills sessions (which was somewhat regretful at the same time as I’d known some of the wonderful instructors there for years). 

I should once again utter some comments regarding my religious developments. I had steadily become more attracted to the Christian religion during sixth grade. Indeed I recall expressing the desire to be baptized in late 2007 to my mother. I also prayed very occasionally-there was one prayer I uttered in 2008 in a hotel room in Sacramento that I would end believing had been the one accepting Christ even though I can barely recall the contents and am reasonably certain that I still did not really understand the Gospel at the time. I also began to regret not going to Sunday School but was not willing to come join the one at my church as I feared that it would be incredibly awkward as some there might recognize who I was and wonder why I hadn’t been there before. However an opportunity came the following year as my father moved churches because of a schism in our old one. I joined the youth group of the new church and began attending services. 

I also acquired Christian ideas from other sources. I had skimmed a few of the comic tracts by Jack Chick which was where I believe I first acquired the famous Bible verse John 3:16, although obviously the various conspiracy theories promoted by Mr. Chick made him discredited in my eyes. There was also a period in early seventh grade when I stumbled upon the cultic and legalistic doctrines promoted by the late Herbert W. Armstrong which made me wonder whether I had to keep the Mosaic dietary laws, although I never  went about practicing it. During this period I found myself sympathetic to the Methodists and later the Southern Baptists denominationally and Arminianism based on a little scrap of biblical knowledge and some shaky reasoning (for example I wondered how in the Calvinist system any could be certain of salvation). It was only in eighth grade I stumbled upon better doctrine, as I discovered Calvinism through the site of Phil Johnson. It is quite providential how I stumbled upon it as I had been looking through hyper fundamentalist websites denouncing Billy Graham and had seen a cult website called a “true church” by a minister named Darwin Fish.  Looking for more information on this cult, I came upon Phil Johnson’s website which had a vast array of links to Calvinist websites. As a result, while I never actually deeply read any sermon or article, I became mildly acquainted with Calvinist ideas and accepted them. It was during this point I really began to wonder about my salvation and often struggled with it. However I constantly I assured myself I had trusted in Christ in the April of 2008 and that my pattern of sinning had declined. Yet in the summer of 2010, right before I began high school I decided that I had not in fact trusted in Christ as someone who had atoned for my sins on the Cross (as I believed I had not properly understood that doctrine) and thus over the course of few days constantly wept and prayed for salvation (in front of my unbelieving but sympathetic mother). Indeed it was amazing how theologically ignorant I was considering that I almost never read Scripture nor actually listened to sermons besides glimpsing occasionally at articles semi-randomly (even then my interest was more drawn to controversial subjects such as the orthodoxy of various ministers and theologians). During this preceding year I had also encountered other Independent Baptists (through a news article about a church in North Carolina which were burning non-KJV Bibles along with the works of heretics) besides Jack Chick such as David Cloud, Biblical Discernment Ministry (which while not IFB has similar tendencies), and jesus-is-savior.com. There I read of their strict doctrines mandating separation from all “worldly” things (such as movies, science-fiction, psychology, and doctrinally erroneous theologians). To this day I have wondered whether they might not be right and I in the wrong about this matter. This has been exacerbated recently through reading such posters as “SinnerSavedByChrist” on PuritanBoard who while a Calvinist unlike those Baptists claimed he had rejected the reading of all non-biblical or theological literature along with video games and secular music. This has torn my conscience apart for oftentimes I will find myself reminded of this while reading some book, which adds to my obsession I mentioned above and thus has retarded my progression in reading. In turn, the obstacles I encounter via this has led to curse various people and even God for making me get these feelings of guilt. Finally at this time I encountered a extreme proponent of Calvinism (for the lack of a better shorthand term) on a website called Outside the Camp who not only pronounces all Arminians damned but also all Calvinists (including John Calvin) who refuses to acknowledge these Arminians damned. During the time I was so uncertain of my salvation I also agonized over whether or not the doctrines propounded by this group might be correct and thus discover that the entirety of the mainstream of Christian church history had been composed of unsaved heretics. 

After some days, I believed that I had become converted. So emotionally destroyed was I that I had my mother read to me Korean books which I had acquired for free from the church library about a year before. At the same time, I discovered the writings of the Deists and the 19th Century agnostic Robert G. Ingersoll and wondered whether they might not be correct after all. Soon after I left these thoughts mostly behind as I entered high school. Unfortunately for myself, sin asserted itself through an unnatural obsession with obscenity and depravity. I had discovered the writings of Marquis de Sade quoted in a work regarding the history of crime and began writing works imitating his (and parodying Charles Dickens’s Great Expectations at the same time) and got in trouble for it twice (getting Saturday Detention on both occurrences and talked to the school psychologist in the latter).  Thus I became known as a bizarre pervert at school. I also recall saying (albeit sarcastically) that I was “sinless” which I believe really calls into question my salvation at the time. 

Yet the developments during this time were not all negative as I met a circle of friends whom I would become come to know well. They unlike most of my previous acquaintances actually invited me to social events and interacted with me at least occasionally outside of school. Like many of my previous friends, I came to annoy them with perverse behaviour but they (to my eternal thankfulness) ended up tolerating it and has stuck by me by and large to this day. They are a diverse lot 

After a long hiatus since kindergarten, I had first developed genuine attraction towards a girl once more in the December of 2009 in a winter concert. I was part of the middle school choir and had seen a girl in high school (who had graduated from my middle school the preceding June) sing a solo of “Christmas Waltz”. I was utterly enchanted by her beauty that for the succeeding several months I thought of naught but her and developed various fantasies of meeting her. So much did I pine for her that I got her phone number from a list and then called it once or twice (tho’ I never said anything on those occasions). Yet when I had created a Facebook account, I never actually interacted much with her. Instead by the time I had entered high school I met another girl whom I had been attracted to by her obvious intelligence. I became even more enamoured with her when I discovered she was in all the same clubs as me. Initially she and I had great conversations with each other but eventually I began to become unnaturally obsessed with her, constantly pestering her with messages. After some unfortunate comments joking about her dyed hair in the summer before sophomore year, she dropped me from her friends list and that was that. I became obsessed with a senior late in my freshman year and made a rather infamous video of her photos to the song “Lili Marleen”. 

One of these clubs that I joined was Model United Nations and was initially certain I had found the perfect club. However at my first conference (at UCLA) I was not able to speak because I was only allowed to go the first day by my parents. In addition as my grades were less satisfactory, they did not allow me to go to the other conferences for the remainder of the year (or rather I was so afraid that I declined to bring up the topics of other conferences to them). This was not the first time my parents had been so restrictive of my interests (even for reasons besides grades). For example in the summer before freshman year I had got into a heated and tearful argument with my father because I wanted to borrow some books at the Anaheim Public Library. However my father did not wish to for he feared that the largely Hispanic population of the area might cause damage to his automobile. For the same reason we usually avoided my native Anaheim when eating at a restaurant or shopping for groceries. Similarly I did not go to Outdoor Education although by the virtue of my transfer to my old school I had opportunities in both 5th and 6th grade to do so. Neither did I go to any Vacation Bible School or Church Retreat until the summer before my junior year of high school. In fact I never spent a night away from my parents or some other family member until in 10th grade when I slept overnight at my youth pastor’s house in Rancho Cucamonga. 

It was in January of 2011 that I came down with a severe case of the flu. For days I lay in bed with a fever until after a couple of days my dad drove me to the emergency room (although he drove all the way down to Fountain Valley). It was during this period than I began to develop an obsessive and unbearable feeling of guilt after having stumbled upon the Old Testament strictures in the Bible mandating the death of children who struck and/or cursed their parents. For I had been guilty in some sense of both these offences against my elders: in elementary school I had on a couple of instances shoved them or even lightly hit them and cursed at them with little but verbal consequences (except as noted above when my uncle was present). Even when I was older I had once cursed at my aunt (after she had been screaming at me as a future failure while I was studying for a math test) in seventh grade and I had playfully faked a slap on my grandmother in ninth grade after she had lightly tapped me on the cheek. Added to this of course were all my secret sins. For yet another incarnation of my obsession was that I felt prone to do violence and curse at virtually everybody who was good to me for seemingly no reason at all. These were truly dark thoughts of murder and extreme verbal abuse which seemingly came out of nowhere or for trivial reasons. My guilt was compounded when I feared the theonomists who advocated the death penalty for these transgressions of the commandments and the rejection of godly Calvinist Christians among whom were many theonomists (even though I quickly learned that these verses really meant those who’d truly viciously assaulted their parents or had verbally imprecated them). Such were my feelings of guilt that on occasion, on the toilet I hit myself on the legs with the plastic of a large bath brush.

Anyways, that sounded like a tangent but its why the computer broke.

My aunt (who is only a year older than me and is considered my sister) and I often fought over the computer, seeing as it was neither of ours, therefore both of ours. If you shared something with a sibling, you know what I mean by that.

One day when I was in my moms room, watching MLP as silently as possible, my aunt comes in and demands I give it to her so she could play on it. I said no because I was watching something. When I didn’t tell her after she asked what I was watching, she tried to snatch it from me, dropping the laptop on the floor and breaking the screen. We both froze, blamed each other for a little bit, then decided that my mom wouldn’t get mad at my 2 year old brother.

When she got home, we said he dropped it off the bed, she scolded us for not watching him properly, and, like we anticipated, forgot about it.

I was trying to work something out at the front desk, and started sobbing. A guy from my college, who I barely knew, saw me crying, and said he was staying another night. He said I could stay with him, as long as I'd be comfortable sharing a bed (his room only had one).

Of course I was scared of sharing a bed with a random dude. And I was dating a horrible, jealous, and controlling man child. He'd be furious if he found out. But I was so desperate, so I just went ahead and did it.

The cowboys cheerleading camp show came on and he asked me “are you going to be daddy’s little cheerleader.” I innocently said “yes.” He then got on top of me (in like a missionary position) and said “cheerleaders need to stretch everyday to become flexible.” He put my legs over my head and started rubbing himself against me.

I was paid to put flyers into newspapers and then deliver them two or three times per week.  I did this diligently for about a year, until I went to middle school and started doing shit differently I guess.

I took note of which houses complained if they didn't get their paper.  I would specifically deliver to them every time on whatever choice wheels I had, and basically throw all the bundles of newspaper and flyers in the dumpster of the housing complex.  Then I would just fuck around and do nothing like a glimpse into the abyss.

It was sporadic at first, but of course it soon became every single time (with the exception of the complainers) for weeks on end until I felt guilty enough to go do it a few times.

The local newspaper is actually very good and has a free high quality online archive dating back to the 1870s.  I did them wrong, even if the pay was shit.  I also find it quite sad that no one even cared.  Such a waste.

It was around 11 PM, and I had just gotten home from a late shift. I live in a small apartment in a not-so-great part of the city, so I’m always a little on edge when walking home. That night felt… off. As I was unlocking my door, I noticed a guy standing at the end of the hallway. He wasn’t doing anything, just standing there, but something about him made my stomach drop.

I got inside, locked the door, and tried to shake it off. Not even five minutes later, someone knocked. Hard. I froze. It wasn’t my neighbor (she texts before coming over), and I don’t really have friends who drop by unannounced.

Then, a voice - “Please, can you just let me in for a second?”

It was a woman. She sounded out of breath, almost panicked. I looked through the peephole, and there she was, maybe mid 20ish, wide eyes, glancing down the hall like she was being followed.

I know, I *know*, stupid move, but I cracked the door open just a little and asked her what is going on.

She whispered that there’s a guy, he’s been following her since she left the train. She didn’t know where else to go from there. That’s when I realized. The guy I saw earlier...

My heart was racing, but I stepped aside and let her in. I locked the door immediately, turned off the lights, and we just stood there in the dark, listening. A few seconds later, heavy footsteps passed my door. Slow. Like someone was looking for something. Then… nothing.

She stayed for about thirty minutes, just sitting on my couch, shaking. I offered her water, and we barely talked. Eventually, she called a friend to come pick her up.

When she left, she just said thank you and disappeared down the hall. I never saw her again.

When I was 8, I was being molested by my tutor, who was also my teacher in class. He was a pastor as well, so he would make us pray together for forgiveness before he did it. Anytime I did anything wrong, he considered that as me wanting him to touch me and would say that I enjoyed it because I kept on doing bad things (like not knowing the answer to a question…)

So I knew what he was doing was bad but I can’t really explain my thought process. He did it so often that I became used to it. I made my younger brother do it to me randomly one year (just put his hand on my very flat chest). This happened periodically about 5 times spanning 3 years. 

My brother is about 3 years younger than me. Over the years, the assault got more explicit. He would start to not only touch my chest but do other stuff with his mouth but that’s as far as we got. 

My head seemed to correct when I turned 11 and I put an end to it for good. But it was too late and he was already ruined. It was now him that tried to initiate the disgusting act, and I had to pretend that I didn’t know what he was talking about.

At 13, I was asleep in my room with a tank top on. It was a deep sleep as I was jet lagged. I woke up to my younger brother still doing that thing to me… my chest was completely out of my tank top. He quickly left.

I was so disgusted with him and couldn’t believe that my own brother would do that me. I couldn’t really blame him though because it was all my fault. Everything was just so twisted and sick.

Nothing happened after that incident and it’s been more than a decade. I sometimes hope that he does not remember the events, but he remembers trips and other details that happened during that time so it’s unlikely. I’m just so disgusted with my self

My youngest was watching and laughed and I thought, finally, nobody believes in this annoying elf anymore. So, Pinecone the elf disappeared after that. This December, my youngest child asked if elf on the shelf was coming back and I told her no, pretty sure her brother had killed him forever.

They will be the bane of your existence for years to come.

Apparently lots of people have strong feelings about the elf. The kids and I had an awesome holiday. We went to Christmas festivals and school programs; they were in a holiday play, we made Christmas cookies and all of the typical holiday joy and not once did we miss the stupid elf. If the elf works for your family, that’s great. And I mean that sincerely. If you’re hanging on by a thread and your cup is empty and one more thing to remember is the last thing you want to do, be kind to yourself.

I worked in an IT department for 8 years, and part of my job was managing company assets. There was a TV in storage that hadn’t been used for years. Nobody ever mentioned it, nobody cared about it—at least that’s what I told myself.

So I decided to take it home.

But I didn’t just take it quietly. I made up a story and filled out a request form saying I was moving the TV to a supplier’s location. A complete lie. The truth is, I was taking it home for myself. I created that fake excuse to make it seem legitimate, and I handed the form in like everything was fine.

The guard saw me taking the TV, took a picture, and reported it. That’s how it got exposed. Everything escalated fast. It became a big issue in the company. I returned the TV within a few days, but the damage was already done.

At the time, I was so defensive. I told myself, *“It’s just a TV. What’s the big deal?”* I felt like people were overreacting and gossiping unnecessarily. But in truth, I had lied, manipulated the system, and broken trust.

My boss was disappointed. They didn’t say much—they just ended my contract quietly. I didn’t get a chance to explain. I lost the job, and even worse, I lost all my friends there. People cut me off, unfollowed or blocked me on social media. No one reached out, no one asked what really happened. I became the center of gossip, even among people who had already left the company.

I know what I did was wrong. I was manipulative. I was persistent. I thought I could get away with it. And now, years later, it still haunts me. I miss my coworkers—not even one person in particular, just the group moments, the laughter, the feeling of belonging.

I didn’t take the TV because I needed it. I think I just wanted a small win. A sense of control. Something that felt like mine in a job where I felt invisible.

I regret it deeply. And I don’t know if people ever really forgive you for something like this. But I needed to get it off my chest.",7302
1zfyy7,1393864383.0,2014-03-03 16:33:03,confession,My Rabbit Hole.,"**tl;dr:** I'm [REDACTED_NAME]-borderline and possibly schizophrenic (doctor's still trying to figure it out) and I do a bunch of dumb shit like lie to my boyfriend about a past stalker in hopes that he'll call me during times that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] instead of just saying, ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and need to talk to someone."" 



I guess this is a confession about confessing.



About a year ago, I had a strange stalker. At first, I was just annoyed. It was a couple of emails sent to me declaring I was a bad person. Because the emails said that the person just happened across (my very private that's only shared with a handful of people) blog, I didn't think much about it. As my story goes on, you'll find I have zero regard for my safety.



Then started the texting. Again, it was mostly annoying, empty stuff. Nothing that really made me feel threatened. Just severely hated by a random person as it was mostly attacks against my supposed personality.



Later that night, there was a cut-up teddy bear on my doorstep. You would think I'd have gone to the police after that. But no, I just ate my qdoba, watched a terrible tv show I won't confess to, and then to bed. I ignored anyone that tried to call or chat with me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure why...almost like I didn't want anyone to talk me into going to the police.



The next morning I did tell my boyfriend at the time. He urged me to go to the police and stay with a friend (BF didn't live in my city) instead of at my apartment by myself. Well duh. That seems like the obvious choice. So I did all that, the police said they'd send a car to patrol my apartment, but that there wasn't much else they could do.



After that though, the stalker stopped for awhile. I almost forgot about him until the texting started again. This time the texts contained information that I didn't think was in my blog. Things I'd only told a friend via g-chat. Concerned (slightly), I looked through my gmail IP logs and didn't find anything suspicious. But I ruminated more about it. His early emails also contained things I couldn't find in my blog. But I didn't use common sense. I didn't change my email pw. I'd reported his first emails to gmail awhiles ago, but that was about it. And I certainly didn't think to change my number. I wondered if it was someone I knew because of some of the details. I think I was too proud to admit that *I* had been hacked.




I moved far away from that apartment for a new job and broke up with my then-boyfriend. I was feeling good. I felt like I had a handle on my life and I was off meds (bipolar and borderline). And I was getting to start over and get out of a miserable relationship. But that was dumb. I was cutting at the time and that should have been a red-flag for me. Cutting and taking zero care of my health/appearance is the first step to my downward spirals. I know this. I ignored this. I thought I was okay without meds.



I got a few texts here and there, but again, I didn't really think much about it. Again, that should have been another red-flag for me. Bipolar people don't think about their safety. In fact, we'll walk into dangerous situations purely for the self-sabotage. Didn't think about. Didn't seek help. Didn't get back on meds. My ex said he got strange texts and I still didn't do anything about it. Honestly, the texts weren't very threatening. Just...annoying and stupid. And extremely non-sensical. Like the guy didn't know how to use grammar...very different from his first email to me, which sounded very formal. Slightly intelligent even.



Shortly after moving, I met a new guy. An amazing guy. We were slowly getting to know each other when the stalker began bothering him (I think). The problem is, I didn't tell him that this person was *my* stalker, not his. He told me the alias of the mass texts he was giving and I didn't tell him. What should have gone through my head was ""holy crap, there's a person from my old place now bothering me in my new place,"" but instead I kept quiet.



Meanwhile, I entered a severely depressed state. I went from cutting to downright suicidal. My parents began this incessant ""why aren't you married yet,"" tirade. The problem is, every time my parents bring up marriage, I dwell on how I've fucked up my other relationships.


My first relationship was horrible. I don't blame him for hating me because he put up with so much when I never sought out help (my parents don't believe in meds, therapy, mental illnesses and a HS student has no independent options really). It was the first time I realized I was capable of being my dad. For 18 years, I learned physical and sexual abuse. The first time I hit my boyfriend, I was horrified. I told myself that would never happen again. I wish he'd been more stern with me about it, but he never considered it as serious as I did. He even tried to make me feel better about it by saying ""it wasn't hard, it didn't hurt me."" That's not the point! The point is, you don't hit people you love. wtf. And then I did it again and again. I entered college and immediately went into therapy. My first line was, ""My dad hit me and now I hit my boyfriend and I'm [REDACTED_NAME]."" While I was working on that, I felt like this wasn't the relationship for me. So I tried to walk out of it, but the guy threatened suicide and I tried again. At this point, the total relationship hit rock bottom. It was a fight everyday. And I was feeling extremely resentful of his suicide threats because I was genuinely suicidal. And as someone struggling so hard with suicidal thoughts, I knew how hard it was to actually talk about it. Most of my friends didn't know.



Then, I don't know why I did it really. It was a night without much thinking....I managed to convince that boyfriend that I'd died. The problem was, that quickly turned into everyone thinking I was dead and me being like, ""oh shit oh shit oh shit, so here's the thing guys...""


Needless to say, we broke up for good shortly after that and I lost a set of friends. As years passed and I made new friends, I'd retell them this story. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure why. My way of warning them I guess. The problem is, they all thought I'd changed or something. But at this point, I'd never taken meds and I was incredibly emotionally unstable. That's putting it lightly.




My second boyfriend...well the only thing I can say for that relationship was that I learned that I no longer had a hitting problem. It was one accomplishment that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of. It was a relationship that tested my temper over and over again. My friends tried to tell me that he wasn't a nice guy and that I should end the relationship. I didn't believe them even though he'd honestly driven me to cutting again. He would say he loved me one day and the next week say he wasn't sure he did. At this point I'd never really done anything bad in the relationship and then one day, I hit another manic episode and began doing very stupid things.



Suddenly everyone thought I was dying of a terminal illness (one I knew nothing about but for some reason people believed me). Again I had the ""oh shit oh shit oh shit"" panic attacks. For two months I kept playing conversations out in my head of how to come clean to people. Finally, I did and lost all my friends again. For some reason my boyfriend still stuck around as a friend...until I started dating again. Then he decided, ""All this time I was fooling myself into thinking you were worth being friends with.""



This hurt me. It hurt because this was the relationship that I genuinely sought help. This was the relationship where I was diagnosed bipolar-borderline and put on meds. This was the relationship where I finally felt like a good person after a year. Suddenly when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and happy again, he decided not to be friends with me.



The point is, when my parents bring up marriage, it sends me into anxiety because I think about all these terrible things I've done and that I *can't* get married. Maybe my parents thought it was okay to bring a child into the world without fixing their need to beat a child. Without fixing the need to do sexually inappropriate things to a child. I can't handle the idea of having an emotionally safe environment. The only thing I've ever wanted is the happy family I never had. But I *can't* do that. At least, not now.




I thought my problem of desperation was fixed. Then I did something terrible to my current boyfriend. He was out one night. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] if I'd texted him, he'd have eventually texted me back. Without thinking, I did something the stalker did to me. I called from random numbers. I didn't think about how this would worry him. I was just feeling *So* suicidal and I wanted him to call me. And he did. He was worried the stalker was bothering me too. I vageuly remember him offering him to come over later if I needed him. I quickly said no and that I'd be okay. I hung up in shame. I vowed I'd never do that again.



Except I did it many times. I did it past a point where the stalker stopped bothering me (I think) and continued to do this to my boyfriend. Every time I felt like cutting or killing myself, instead of telling him this is how I was feeling, I did the fake calling. After hanging up, I'd feel even more suicidal over what a bad person I was and it just never ended. I tried to stop but for some reason I couldn't get myself to stop before I did.



At some point, I should have thought, ""You really need help and need to get back on meds."" I didn't.


It got really bad one day and I thought, okay, today is the day I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to kill myself. I had a bunch of plans going through my head, so I went to a store and bought several supplies (I think). I had a lot of prescription drugs leftover from when I'd stopped taking them, and I popped a lot before and after the store. Apparently you hallucinate a ton after OD'ing on seroquil. You'd think I was smart enough to know that.



No, I woke up, convinced I'd made it to the hotel I planned on killing myself at, got raped and cut there (wtf), somehow made it back to my car, and was still at the store I drove to. I was *so* confused when I woke up. My boyfriend was freaking out from not hearing from me. I called him, still kinda' fuzzy and he told me to come over. I remember trying to drive and then stopping the car because I didn't feel okay to drive.



It was a weird-feeling state. I felt like I had control over my motions, but was in shock. I made it back to my boyfriend's and didn't tell him what had happened. He knew something was off and we just kind of sat in silence and listened to music until I'd calmed down enough to sleep.



Then began these nightmares. I was convinced I'd been raped. Even awake, I'd literally hear his voice. The memory is still so vivid to me. It turned up my suicidal notch tenfold.



My boyfriend was patient with me. He took care of me every night. Meanwhile, what was I doing? Making these god damn stupid calls instead of telling him how I felt and that I needed him. Sometimes I stopped myself and tried telling him the truth. It was getting insane.




I tried to drop hints....to lead up to what I was doing. I told him the bad things I'd done in my past relationships. I kept asking, ""so if I've done something similar, could you forgive me?"" But every time I got to present-day, I couldn't continue. I was afraid. I then tried seeking help, knowing I needed to get back on meds and that I needed severe help. But the first therapist I went to rejected me. ""This is something beyond that I can help.""



Well way to make me feel more suicidal. I gave up on finding help until I saw how stressed my suicidal feelings were making my boyfriend. I went to the hospital again and said I needed help finding help basically. They gave me a huge list of numbers to call and I left the same voicemail for 50+ doctors, hoping someone could see me ASAP.



Finally someone did. A lady who's both a psychiatrist and a therapist. I felt like my prayers had been answered. I felt like I was going insane between hearing voices and feeling my rapist, feeling intensely suicidal and hopeless, and the GUILT. Oh god. The guilt.




She saw me for a long time for my first appointment. She started asking me questions that made me feel extremely worried. She could tell I was getting anxious and she tried to assuage me. ""A lot of highly intelligent people suffer from schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder...but I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to need more time to figure out which one you might have.""  ....excuse me?!



It was during that appointment that she pointed out that it was way more likely that I hallucinated the rape than it actually happening. I started freaking out. I was orally raped when I was 13 on top of the things my dad did that I don't want to go into. I know how serious rape is. I can see right past girls that do lie about it and it *angers* me how lightly we take rape culture. Suddenly I started feeling more guilty. Immediately after my appointment, I called my boyfriend and told him what had happened. I expected him to break-up with me.



Because after the ""rape"" happened, I went through a cycle of extreme anger that I had no one to take out on except those around me to continual tears and more intensely suicidal feelings. He put up with all that crap and it wasn't even real? Gah, I feel so awful.




I'm [REDACTED_NAME] back on meds and I feel more stable. Way less suicidal, but every time my parents contact me, the feelings come back. I think it's a reflex to anything they say to me really. I was still making the phone calls when these feelings came back.  For months, I've kept trying to think of a way to bring it up. I told myself that once I stopped, I'd confess and say ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] crazy anymore though!""



The problem is, I've only been on meds for 2 weeks and I'll go a week or so without making a call, then make a call. Finally, yesterday morning, my boyfriend calls me into the room and says, ""Is this you?""



I tried to fight it for like...15 seconds. Then I started confessing everything. 3 hours of confessing.



In my head, whenever I imagined the confession, I always pictured him yelling at me, calling me a bad person, and throwing me out of his place or walking out of mine.



Well this was worse. He didn't yell at me. He questioned me, trying to piece together the truth. He's pretty sure there was never a stalker and that it was me the entire time. That's fair for him to think because I've done nothing that would indicate otherwise.



The worst was his face and expression. In the past, when I've confessed my terrible sins, I've been met with faces of disgust and hatred. But he was *hurt*. It's the face of someone who got hurt by someone they trusted and loved. My feelings went from ""oh shit oh shit oh shit, how do i get out of this,"" to ""oh god, how could i have ever done this to *him*"". Why wasn't him being so damn kind to me enough? Why did I feel like I needed to do this? And why couldn't I see that just because I didn't have regard for my own safety that he clearly did. All the time he thought there was someone after him and it was me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] worst piece of shit out there.



I want to earn back his trust, but I couldn't honestly tell him I'm [REDACTED_NAME] better now! Because it just isn't true. I just started meds 3 weeks ago and a year out of therapy and back in it means I've got a ton of shit to work through again.



I'm [REDACTED_NAME] relieved that he finally does know the truth, but I never wanted to face the fact that I hurt someone I love so much. A part of me felt it daily, hence the anxiety and suicidal thoughts. But I never thought I'd ever see so much hurt on his face. He's never done anything to hurt me so bad and this is what I went around and did.




When I was in 7th grade, I had a friend. We had a pattern. I told her a story and a week later I would tell her, ""Actually, I don't think that happened. I lied."" She never had the hurt reaction. Instead, she said, ""Either you stop lying, or you learn to deal with your lies."" She once suggested I find a job where I could use my persuasion skills. That's probably when I should have cried for help.




I thought the problem started when I was 22 and my parents officially disowned me. I tried killing myself, someone found me, took me to the hospital, called my parents, and they decided to talk to me again. I thought that's when I'd learned that the only way someone could care about me was if I was in danger.




But the truth is, my problems started way before that and I should have gotten help sooner. I should have never gone off my meds. And even though I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I confessed everything, it'll never change my guilt over all this.",4
1jspnlk,1743928852.0,2025-04-06 08:40:52,confession,I used to steal from Walmart when I was in my 20s to commit return fraud,"I used to work as a vendor inside of Walmart for an obsolete company back about 10 or so years ago. I took the job to get away from an extremely toxic boss. The job I took was selling a not-so-popular product inside of Walmart, and, due to the obsolescence of the product, it backfired on me.

Well, those bills started coming due. Specifically, it was my phone bill that was the most pressing. I had Cricket for my cell phone plan. I had already stripped it down to the absolute lowest I could go and still couldn't pay it but needed it for work and to find new work. So I thought up this brilliant idea to steal small and very low value mundane things from the Walmart store I was working in. I knew electronics, cosmetics, health aides, toys and groceries would be watched by store security but not the insignificant things I was taking. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] about like batteries for cordless phones that nobody really used anymore, or the two-packs of gel pens which were some of my favorites to take due to their size and relatively decent value, and other low value mundane things that I could *quickly* sneak up my sleeve under a shelf and out of the view of cameras. These were things that were all like $10 each or less. Every time I went on break, I'd hide the thing I got in my car and then would take another thing in the same way at the end of my shift. I would get about $15-$30 worth of mundane merchandise each day I worked.

I then returned all the merchandise back to customer service at a different Walmart without a receipt to get an in-store credit. I was able to use that in-store credit to then buy a Cricket prepaid card and my phone bill ended up paid. That was of utmost importance so that, yes, my current employer could call me, but also, more importantly, so that prospective employers could call me. So I was able to keep the scheme going and was able to use the gift cards to buy groceries and I paid one or two more cell phone bills out of it. 

I was desperately trying to find a new job though because even though I was doing that out of pure necessity, I have integrity and so I certainly didn't enjoy doing it by any means and wanted to stop the very SECOND that I could. And I did. The moment I didn't NEED to do it anymore, I stopped and never did the act again. But I look back on that dark time and I regret it but I also kind of don't at the same time. I know it wasn't the right thing to do but I wasn't doing it for pleasure. I did it to simply survive. There wasn't much else I knew to do at the time. I didn't think of getting a second job and gig apps weren't really a thing even then. I was so thankful that I didn't get caught but I know that I deserved to.

On a side note, the obsolete company I was a rep for still exists today selling the same obsolete product. They stay in business somehow.",296
jayw88,1602674887.0,2020-10-14 11:28:07,confession,When I was a preteen I stole a towel full of quarters from my best friend.,"I was really poor. Like, really hungry all the time poor. My friend however had a nice middle class life. She and I would spend every single weekend in its entirety together for the better part of a decade. I loved her but I was jealous because *she never ate anything* and it was by choice. Even when I stayed the night I was going hungry. 

Anyway she had one of those giant parking meter “piggy banks” that was probably 4 foot tall and filled half way up with change. She asked me to help her count it one day and I eagerly agreed. (I have always loved counting change, even now that I’m in my mid twenties and financially stable). So we get to work. Quarters over here, pennies there, all in dollar groups, nice and tidy. 

She leaves the room for some reason, probably for the bathroom, and like an instinct I start gathering as many quarter piles as I can without it being blatantly obvious that a bunch are missing. I put them in my towel from swimming the day before and folded it up to look casual. I’m sure it was pretty obvious. 

Anyway I’m pretty sure she knew because she looked at the towel at some point and asked me when I was going home shortly after. I feel really terrible about it to this day. I was just so hungry back then and when my brother and I found quarters we’d always run to the liquor store and by cheap little Debbie snacks.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone that extended their kind words and experiences! I’m trying to reply to everyone that I can but I would like to clarify that I do not have contact with this person anymore. She went down a dark path and is now considered “dangerous”. I’m always hoping she will get clean and sober and I can make an amends but until I feel it’s a safe situation I will have to forgive my younger self. Again thank you so much!",3142

I am [REDACTED_NAME] my 20s and I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I am [REDACTED_NAME] person unfortunately. I can assure you that I am, on the inside, a very loving person. I hate passive aggressiveness, and appreciate frankness. I am [REDACTED_NAME] happy to meet most people I do, and the ones I don't like, I just avoid. I don't backbite or gossip. I give people sincere advice when they ask for it, and many friends have told me I give them a comfortable older sister vibe so they feel comfortable asking me for advice. Maybe it's that I don't think through what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to say and choose to speak impulsively rather than thoughtfully, but over the past few years, it's become more and more apparent to me that I am [REDACTED_NAME] kind of a b****. This isn't really a confession. It's a realization. And it makes me really sad. 

I try to give in charity, volunteer my time, offer a smile and kind words to neighbours, always bring my best self for family and friends, mind my own business, focus on self improvement, but mistakenly end up saying things that could be seen as passive aggressive insults. I don't really know how to be kinder. I don't know how to be more thoughtful when I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Sure, starting out in a conversation, I can be mindful, but once that flow starts going, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] flowing with the conversation without thinking about what I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. I struggle with valuing myself as it is and carry a lot of guilt in general, I don't know how to get past this. I kind of hate myself for being this way. 

Examples of statements I've made completely innocently that were offensive to others:

1. Met an indigenous girl, I was fascinated by her culture and asked her permission to learn more about her culture from her. She was cool with it so I started asking more about their lifestyle, hunting, the foods they eat, etc. In the context of this, I asked her if igloos were a real thing. She responded normally, but later posted about me completely tearing me apart for daring to ask her something like that (about igloos specifically). 

2. Saw a friend being bombarded with verbal conversations on different topics with 4 different people at the same time and keeping up with them successfully. I popped in to ask him if he had ADHD because I found it amazing that he was able to do that. (In my mind, I saw it as a very valuable skill that he was able to keep up with so many conversations, and I thought it might be because he is able to maintain different streams of conversation - said as a compliment, if you're able to follow my train of thought) 

There have been so many of these kinds of instances in my life. It really sucks to be that person. I don't want to be seen as the person who is always hurting others with random hurtful statements. Any advice? ",504

What started as a way to sleep a little easier turned into something that’s taken over my life. I started taking Benadryl a while ago just to help knock me out. But over time, it stopped being about sleep. I started taking more. And more. I liked the way it made everything feel… distant. Like I could turn off my brain.

I’ve talked about it before as some of you have read. I told myself I was in control. That I could stop whenever I wanted. But that was a lie. I’ve been hospitalized now. My body couldn’t keep up with what I was doing to it. I was hallucinating, disoriented, a shell of myself,hearing my dead mother, seeing the hat man, feeling trapped in my own skin. The doctors told me I was lucky to even make it in. Lucky. That word feels weird when you’re strapped to a hospital bed wondering what the hell you’ve done to yourself.

Even now, even after everything, there’s still this part of me that wants to go back to it. It scares the hell out of me. I feel like I’ve rewired my brain and now I can’t find the way back to normal. I don’t even remember what normal feels like.

I have no one to talk to. Maybe just to get it off my chest. Maybe because I feel like I’m screaming into a void and hoping someone hears me. I don’t want to be this person. I want out. I can’t keep going like this, I have seen things I can’t explain and things I don’t know how to explain like smells, creatures, and I’ve felt like I’ve been floating in a world beyond my understanding.",6733

when i turned 15, things started falling apart. my mental health completely deteriorated. i developed anorexia and ended up hospitalized. my channel became impossible to keep up with. i stopped posting for almost a year, and everything i built just started to disappear. then, when i finally wanted to come back, i made a stupid decision that basically ruined any chance of reviving my channel. i tried downloading adobe software for free (yeah, dumb, i know), got hacked, and the hacker posted some graphic content on my channel. i got permanently banned. and instead of contacting youtube right away, i just gave up. i was so mentally checked out that i didn’t even care at the time and told myself i would ""deal with it later"". when i finally tried to appeal months later, youtube denied me. i tried everything i possibly could to get my channel back, and nothing worked.

my mom had spent most of the money, but she left me around $100k. i had to literally beg her for over a year to give it to me. but like an idiot, i blew it. car, addictions, very bad decisions. it turns out my mom was right all along. when i was 19, i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started drinking a lot. now i’m in my 20s, completely broke, completely alone, and i feel like a fucking loser. i know i’m stupid. i know i made horrible choices. but please don’t judge me too harshly. i wasn’t in my right mind, and at the time, i didn’t care about my future because i wished i was dead. i couldn’t see past the moment i was in, and i just let everything fall apart.

 i think about my past a lot. how much potential i had, how i literally had it all at 14, and how i just let it slip away. i don’t know how to move on from it. i peaked as a teenager and now i have nothing. if anyone’s ever recovered from throwing their life away, i’d really love to hear how. because right now, i don’t see a way forward.",9086
1ll054a,1750944467.0,2025-06-26 13:27:47,stories,"16 y/o family ""friend"" sa'ed me when I was 7. Years later, he visited my dad on his deathbed with his wife and kids.","As a kid I, 25 female, use to live in a small apartment complex with most of the tenants being families with multiple children. One of my neighbors being a relative and another neighbor ended up becoming my godparents, because of this it was common for the kids to take turns going to one another's houses, playing outside, and just hanging out. All of the Families use to plan holidays together, camping trips, and attend each others parties. It was easy to see one another as family. 

There was one family who at the time had one son Oleander, 16M, and two daughters just a few years older than me, Calypso 9 and Delilah 12 . So one random night they invite me to a sleepover. Of course my mom had no issue with it since their apartment was across from us. We did the usual girl sleepover things then we went to sleep. I remember waking up with the lights on, my night gown was pulled up around my waist, and my underwear was pulled down by my knees. I looked around and did not see the girls anywhere. I heard footsteps. I was scared so I fixed my clothes and pretended I was asleep. That's when Oleander came into the room again and proceeded until he was satisfied. 

I grew up in a traditional Mexican household. Those who experienced that knows how some Hispanic parents can have a conservative outlook on SA. Bc of that I kept my SA a secret until I was in HS and shared  my story with a few friends of mine. As the years went on families moved out, others moved in and the bond between families grew weaker. Enough to the point where I went no contact with Oleander and his family. I no longer had a reminder so I thought about it less and less until I eventually successfully repressed those memories. Or so I thought.

When I was about 23 my dad had a stroke and was hospitalized for about 20 days. Early on  into my dad's hospitalization, Oleander, his wife and kid came to visit him. I was sitting inside of my dad's hospital room with my boyfriend and my younger brother. As soon as I saw him, I got up and immediately excused myself. I ran to the restroom and broke out in tears. The fear of losing my dad was overwhelming enough and I now had to confront the feelings of childhood SA. I told my boyfriend that was my assaulter and we tried to pull my mom to the side to say goodbye and leave right away. (My bf knew abt the assault but not who he was.) Right when I went to grab our bags to hide my tear stained face from my mom, he came out from the icu to the hospital lobby. He had the whole audacity to come out of my dad's hospital room crying. He went straight to his wife and my other family members where they offered him sympathy. I went into shock. 

That's when I realized I did not want him coming to the funeral. (I was still in denial about how my dad was doing so a funeral had not even crossed my mind at this point) It took me a few weeks to be brave enough to have that conversation with my mom and older brother. they both agreed to tell him he is not welcomed at the funeral.

I will definitely say I am [REDACTED_NAME] to unpack what happened when I was younger and seeking out a therapist. I, sometimes, have dreams and flashbacks of suppressed memories. I have been reflecting and realized a few patterns. DISCLAIMER: THESE ARE SOME THEORIES AND SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. THESE ARE MY THOUGHTS AS I UNCOVER MORE INFORMATION AND GO THROUGH PICTURES  OF MY CHILDHOOD.

Oleander's wife is his younger sister's (calypso) best friend and they got together when she was 17/18 and he was about 23/24. Fucking weird if you ask me. 

I was told Oleander tried to convince my older brother to engage in oral sex with him when they were teenagers, not that long after my SA. My brother declined. 

When I was younger I developed a habit of isolating myself and became a reserved child. (Can anyone take any guesses why? lol) I remember feeling isolated and feeling a weird shift in my relationship with Calypso and Delilah as kids. There's multiple instances where they made fun of me, mimicked me, and/or encourage others to join in. I was not confrontational as a child. I was always shy and soft spoken. I got diagnosed with ADHD later as an adult.

After my dad passed my family threw a few fundraisers and I was forced to be around the same people from my childhood. At this point Oleander has two more younger siblings, Joseph and Natalia. Taking the family from 5ppl to 7ppl around the time my dad passed. When I was there I was observing the sisters' interactions with my family. The way the spoke softly to my younger brother and shared words of encouragement, they hugged my mom gently, rubbing her back when she teared up talking about my dad, and even interacted with my baby nephew making him giggle. Seeing this put me at ease. I felt like this was a non-verbal confirmation that things were not gonna be weird or awkward. I talked to the two youngest siblings, Joseph and Natalia, and we had a smooth, heartfelt conversation. (This fundraiser happened after I told my family and after they told oleander he is not welcomed at the funeral) When calypso and Delilah finally spoke to me they only offered their condolences in a quiet monotone voice. At the time, I noticed and was taken aback by the shift in energy but did not want to draw attention to it. I still tried to be understanding and assumed their social battery ran out or they were starting to get tired. I, now, think they might have known/found out about the assault. I later wondered if the bullying I experienced from them as a kid was because they heard noises/witnessed something? Was that their attempt to try to protect him? Or make sure I don't say anything? Or maybe, they don't know anything and simply don't like  me? I don't really care about how their family may or may not feel about me but I sometimes wish I did speak up back then. I wish I had some sense of justice for what happened to me and how that drastically changed the person I am [REDACTED_NAME]. if people in my real life knew the kind of person Oleander is, would I feel better? Even if I don't feel better, Is it the right thing to do? tell the truth to his wife? Have a one on one convo where I call him out? Tell him I remember and he's a piece of shit and to never contact me again? Idk, idk. I would appreciate some Help! Any other sa survivors feel the same?! How did you heal? I would appreciate any advice and to hear your stories and Thanks for reading. ",15
1h1ymjk,1732808366.0,2024-11-28 15:39:26,stories,"Hey there, I want to share my story, which is mainly about the hug someone gave me when I needed it the most. It was the best thing I had felt in years, and I didn’t even know I needed that hug.","Hey there, I don’t really know why I’m sharing my story maybe because I feel the need to talk about it. Since I’m not comfortable sharing with people I know, I guess I’ll share it with random strangers I’ll probably never see again in this lifetime, lol.

I’ll start by giving some context about myself and this group of friends. I’m a 22m, and for the past few years, I’ve spent most of my time alone without any close friends. Everyone I met in school or university never really wanted to spend time with me or get close I’m not sure why. But there’s this group of 15 people I’ve known for more than 10 years. Every August, we’d always meet at the “summer park” and spend the whole month together.

Nowadays, things are different because some of them have new responsibilities and jobs, so we can’t see each other as often. Still, I love every single one of them. I literally count down the 255 days (or however long it takes) just to spend those 20 days of the year with them. Honestly, it’s the highlight of my year.

Over the past 7 or 8 years, I started having issues with my mental health due to accumulating memories, traumas, and personal problems. But I never had the courage to talk to anyone about it. For some reason, it feels more important to me to make sure that everyone around me especially that group of friends is laughing and having a good time. I really do love seeing smiles on their faces.

Even if their laughter comes at my expense, I don’t care. To me, it’s worth it. For those seconds or minutes when they’re laughing and reminiscing about old shenanigans we did together, I know they’re genuinely happy. In those moments, they’re not thinking about their problems at home, at university, at work, or anywhere else.

I’ve always made sure everyone was having a good time, even though I was suffering silently the whole time. I didn’t open up because I felt like they didn’t need to know. I also worried that sharing my struggles would steal their time or burden them.

But eventually, I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I lost my mind and started doing so many things to escape reality or just to feel something different. It was horrible. I felt sick every day, and I don’t even know why. The anxiety was overwhelming I felt it in my head and arms, but I can’t really explain it. I started drinking and, especially, cutting, just to feel something different.

I couldn’t enjoy anything in my life. None of the activities I used to love brought me any satisfaction. Worst of all, I couldn’t even enjoy the company of those same friends I treasured so much. It was horrible I felt like I was losing my mind.

Fortunately, I finally gained the courage to speak with two of my closest friends from that group. I asked for help and explained what I was going through. They were shocked. Out of everyone they knew, they said I was the last person they would have expected to be struggling with depression and other issues.

It was weird opening up to them. I had never been in a relationship, never been vulnerable, intimate, or open with anyone before. This was the first time I had ever shared something so personal, and it felt strange. On one hand, I felt relief for finally managing to speak with someone. But on the other hand, it felt incredibly uncomfortable. Sharing my issues with someone wasn’t something I was used to, and it left me feeling exposed and unsure.

But to be honest, I felt horrible telling them about my struggles because I could see in their eyes how much they wanted to help, but they just couldn’t relate. They didn’t know what to say besides offering me their company, listening, and trying to understand. I’m still glad I spoke with them, though.

There’s one more person I shared my issues with: the girlfriend of one of those close friends. I’d known her for about four years, but I had barely spoken to her. I’m not even sure why we’d only talked a few times, usually when I was drunk, and I can’t think of any other meaningful interactions we’d had.

But as soon as she realized something was wrong with me, she was determined to help and understand me. She put in so much effort and time to be there for me, and I didn’t even know why. I remember asking her why she was doing it, and she’d always say, “Don’t worry about it, just accept it.”

I knew my friends liked me and cared about me, but none of them showed the kind of love and care that she did. It was so strange yet incredible the dedication and persistence she had were unbelievable. She truly is a one in a billion person.

There was one night when I completely lost my mind. I felt so disconnected from everyone, everything, and even myself. I started doing reckless things, and I ended up asking her for company. I felt terrible asking I don’t know, maybe because I thought I was wasting her time. But she drove more than 30 minutes to meet me at a park near my house.

I can still remember it like it was yesterday: hearing her car stop, the handbrake being pulled, and the car door closing. She got out, walked into the park, and came right up to me. She stopped in front of me with a smile on her face and opened her arms.

I can’t remember anyone giving me a hug like that. After all those years of suffering in silence, alone with my thoughts, hating myself, and slowly losing my mind, that hug was the best thing I’d felt in years. For the first time, I felt “normal.” I felt safe. I felt loved and cared for.

It was incredible. I still cry every single time I think about that hug. Honestly, I don’t think a day goes by where I don’t remember it.

All those years spent alone with my own thoughts and fears, carrying the weight of everything I went through my struggles and traumas and then finally, someone hugs you. It was the best feeling. It was so special. I felt my arms and head relax for the first time in forever. I felt comfortable. I felt cared for.

It was truly something special, and it helped me so much.",8
1c7jtp9,1713487902.0,2024-04-19 00:51:42,stories,"Read my story, and learn from my mistakes.","Okay, I have a story to tell. It’s a long one, so buckle up. Just bear in mind, though this story is true, most of it happened a long time ago. I’m going to try to write it down as best as I can remember. As I said, it took place a long time ago; remembering some events is like grasping at smoke in the wind, while some memories are sharp and vivid, etched in my mind as though they happened a few hours ago. I’ll try to piece it together to the best of my abilities. I’ll try my best not to use any names, I hope that will not make it too confusing.  
  
When I was in high school—a long long time ago—I was head over heels for this one girl. We were friends. We had a class together for two years, and worked together running one of the after school clubs. The biggest problem was that I really didn’t belong there. I was too old. I had been in an accident, and was severely injured—almost died. I worked hard for years to get my life back, and when I could physically handle the day to day grind I returned to school. I wasn’t at 100%--I never will be (I had a damaged lung, breathing issues, and lost an arm in the accident). I re-started high school as a freshman at 18 years old. I met her when I was 19 at the beginning of my sophomore year. She was a junior at the time, and had just turned 16. Bear in mind, this is long before social media, smart phones, texting—none of that existed yet…I’m talking dawn of the internet—dial-up AOL pay by the minute access. Yes, I’m as old as dirt. Even for the time, I was old fashioned. I was also not in the best state of mind when it came to confidence with girls. Every other aspect of life, I was good to go, but when it came to dealing with the opposite sex…I was worried nobody would want someone as broken as me.  
  
I couldn’t just ask her out, but I couldn’t ignore what I was feeling either, so I wrote her a note explaining what I was feeling and asking permission to pursue her. Yeah, I’m old, we’ve established that. Her response was more or less what I expected; she said she thought I was really cool, but she thought it would be a bad idea, and we should just be friends for several reasons: First, she was interested in someone else, and if he were to notice her she wouldn’t want to hurt me because I was such a nice guy. Second, her parents didn’t allow her to date. And third, even if her parents did let her date, they would never let her go out with someone so much older.  
  
So, she gave me a solid no. I get it. I understood. I decided to back off and create some distance until what I was feeling could pass. I sat at a different table in class. I sat with a different group in the after school club we were both a part of. I tried to keep my distance from her. The faculty advisors of the club had other plans. They decided that our abilities complimented each other and put us in charge of the club. Now I had no choice but to directly interact with her. My mind was still in recovery mode, so quitting the club (or anything else for that matter) was not an option for me.   
  
She and I were still friendly, so I bit my tongue, swallowed my feelings, and did the work. I sat with her in class, headed up the club meetings beside her, and worked head to head with her on all club business. By the end of December I was driving her home every day; I had my license, my own car, and a sweet handicapped parking spot right outside the school.   
  
More than a few classmates took notice of the amount of time she and I were spending together. I was asked on more than one occasion if we were dating, or told that I should ask her out. My response was always that we were just friends. I even started using our age difference as an excuse. In fact, I used my age as a shield for any inquiries into who I might be interested in at school; playing what I called the ‘forbidden fruit’ card on several occasions. I tried going out with a few other girls my own age, but I just wasn’t feeling it. I knew it didn’t make sense, but I still only wanted to be with her, knowing I never would. So I just gave up and buried myself in work.  
  
I was still trying to get myself back to where I was before I got hurt, even though I knew I’d never get there. I was into martial arts, kendo, and fencing; I was actually quite a good fighter at one point, so when the summer came, I threw myself back into training as much as I could. I still had difficulty breathing, but I was trying to build back my strength and stamina. Over the summer months I was either working or training, but no matter how busy I kept myself, I couldn’t keep my mind off of her, wondering where she was, what she was doing…daydreaming about spending time with her, then beating myself up, knowing that it was never going to happen. I kept telling myself to just get over it, with no luck.  
  
When September rolled around I headed back to school, confident that I could just drop back into the daily routine of burying my feelings, wrapping myself in my stone-faced, icy exterior and working through the grind beside her. And that worked just fine for about the first 60 seconds after she walked into the room. I had to excuse myself, went to the bathroom and put cold water on my face just to regain my composure. I didn’t think seeing her again would hit me so hard, and I don’t think anyone noticed how close I was to falling apart. A few deep breaths later and I was ready to get back to business as usual.   
  
That day, I met her younger sister, and drove them both home. Not long after that she volunteered me to drive another girl home as well. I didn’t really mind; I had been hurt walking home from school so just the idea of someone walking home gave me the shivers. The thing was, the sisters lived closer to the school than this third girl. It would have made more sense for me to drop them off before the third girl, but she insisted that this girl get dropped off first. She also insisted that this girl and her sister sit in the back seat while she rode shotgun. I didn’t really think about it at the time, but it does seem strange now that I’m thinking about it.  
  
We were back in the groove of classes and after school club meetings; I was keeping myself focused and on task. I kept my feelings buried, nose to the grindstone, and focused on the task at hand. A few months into the school year the club’s first project was nearing completion. She and I stayed late, making copies in one of the office rooms, and nearing the end of the day’s work I noticed that she had a smudge of ink on her face. I laughed and pointed it out. She tried to wipe it off, but rubbed the wrong side of her face, so I pointed out the location of the smudge by reaching out with my hand. I didn’t quite touch her face, but I did seem to rattle something loose in my head.   
  
All I had to do was take one step forward, put my hand behind her head, and draw her in for a kiss. Instead, I stepped back, excused myself, and quickly made my way to the nearest bathroom in search of some cold water to splash on my face. Five minutes, three handfuls of cold water, and several deep breaths later, I had regained my composure. I dried my face off, went back to the office, and took her home. That was a close call. I told myself I had to find a better way of controlling my emotions. And for a while, it worked.  
  
After Christmas break we started ramping up the club’s second project, and I was determined to keep myself focused and under control. I did okay for a while, kept my composure, and got my work done. January was pretty uneventful, but February was hard. Valentine’s Day was brutal, and that was the day I finally broke. I decided I was done, that sometimes it was okay to give up and quit.  At the next club meeting just before February vacation I chewed out most of the club members for some poor behavior, announced that I was quitting, and walked out. I told her that I would still help, but I wasn’t going to put myself through the club meetings anymore. That was a lie. I had no intention of going back to the club, and in fact had intended for the next day, Friday, to be my last day in school. I cut the class we shared because I didn’t want to face her. I also intended to turn in my books and leave early, stranding her and her sister without a ride home…dick move, I know, but I felt it was for the best.   
  
My faculty advisor, the teacher whose class I had just blown off, tracked me down the next period in study hall and sat across the table from me. Mrs. L. informed me that I could not quit the club because, for me, it was part of her class, and if I quit the club she would have to fail me. She just about fell out of her chair when I told her she could go ahead and fail me, because I didn’t need the grade. Then I let her know one of my little secrets; my guidance counselor worked with the assistant principal to arrange a time during February vacation to take the GED exam. A $75 fee and an afternoon at a testing center in the next town over would get me my certificate. I wasn’t coming back.  
  
Surprised, Mrs. L shook her head and sighed sadly. She told me that she understood that I was going through a difficult time, but that I’d gone through so much and I shouldn’t give up. Then she just about knocked me out of my chair; she said she could tell that I was always sure of myself, but not everyone was as confident in themselves. She said “you’ve got to give her more time, she’ll come ‘round”.  
  
Wait, what? She laughed at me and told me that, though she was only a teacher, she was not blind or stupid. She said she could tell that there was a connection between me and this girl, that she had never seen two people more suited for one another, but this girl just wasn’t ready to accept it…but she would come around, and I needed to give her more time. Or, I could just walk away, and never know.  
  
Mrs. L left me with a lot to think about. I stuck out the rest of the day, drove the sisters home, and headed off to think. Needless to say, that GED exam that I paid for went untaken, and after vacation I was back at school, back to the club, and back to my day to day grind. Mrs. L. let the club know that I was back under protest, because of her class. My plan to leave was never spoken of again until I just typed it out.  
  
Not much changed over the next month, until one dreary day in March. Most of the underclassmen were on a field trip, and this girl and I were pretty much alone in Mrs. L.’s class. We were just sitting at our table talking about nothing of any consequence; until she looked down and started telling me about a guy she worked with. She told me that this guy was cool, but kinda different. As she went on describing this guy, her description seemed more and more familiar. Everything she told me about this guy could also apply to me. Then she said that she liked him, and he liked her, but he was older than her, so nothing could ever happen between them. Was she really talking about me? I have no idea…and at this point, I never will. That conversation has stayed etched in my mind for 30 years. Just typing out this paragraph pulls my heart up into my throat.   
  
April popped up, and I walked into Mrs. L.’s class where I found this girl totally freaking out. She had forgotten her science project at home and her mom wasn’t home for the day. Without that project, her science grade would drop. Me being me, I volunteered to take her home to pick it up. Mrs. L. couldn’t give us permission to leave the school, but she said as far as she was concerned, she saw nothing, heard nothing, and knew nothing. This girl and I snuck out of the school to my car, and I took her home. When we got to her house she asked if I wanted to come in for a drink. I declined, telling her we should probably hurry back before we were missed. She went into the house to retrieve her work, taking what I felt was way too long to simply grab a project. As she climbed into my car she slipped, crashing into my shoulder. It would have been so easy for me to just lean in to her and kiss her, but I just sat back and tried to help her into her seat. I was able to get us back to the school just before class ended. She went to drop off her project in the science lab while I went to let Mrs. L. know we were back and our mission was accomplished. I picked up the book-bag I had left in Mrs. L.’s room and started walking toward study hall. Instead, I walked to the library and asked my media teacher if there was a quiet place where I could get some work done alone. He gave me a key to one of the empty media labs and told me to return it by the end of the day. That’s where I sat, in the dark, through my study period, lunch, and my next class. Breathing deeply, trying to meditate, center myself, whatever I could do to regain my composure, I found myself shaking in the darkness. After about an hour I was able to steady myself, calm down, and regain emotionless self-control. After I dropped the sisters off after school, I headed home and sat in my room until the next morning.  
  
The rest of the month was difficult, April vacation serving as a cursed blessing; I was away from her for the entire week, but I was away from her for an entire week! No…not even a school vacation can be easy. As May crept up on me, Mrs. L.’s words “you’ve got to give her more time, she’ll come ‘round” started to weigh upon me. She was a senior, and would be graduating in the beginning of June. Time was running out. As much as they hurt, I wanted to hold on to those days as long as I could. And finally, time ran out. On her last day, when I dropped her off, I gave her a small gift, and said goodbye. For some reason, I was sure I’d never see her again. I went home and locked myself in my room. It was over. Time was up. She didn’t come ‘round. As much as it hurt knowing she was gone, I felt as though a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I wouldn’t have to mask my feelings with her anymore. There would be no one to shake my self-control. There would be no more daily torment. I was free from my daily agony.  
  
My peace lasted all but a week. She turned up at school with the club’s final project for the year. She showed up to pick up her sister. Like a bad penny, she kept showing up, and every time I just wanted to hug her, hold her close, and never let her go. When summer finally came I found my numbing relief, as I was away for much of the break. This time, I knew it was over. If I could put the memory of her out of my mind, I knew I could find some kind of peace.  
  
A few weeks away helped me get my head right. I was solidly in control. I had, over the last few years, regained much of my strength. And now I finally had my self-control back. Now, nothing could shake me. Nothing could distract me. She was gone, my heart was dead, and I was good to go. Until…  
  
It was early. I’d just gotten out of the shower and gotten dressed when my phone rang. It was her. She called to ask if I’d still be able to give her sister a ride home from school; something I had already agreed to do. She told me it was her 18th birthday. She was finally free of her parents’ rules. She told me about her college in the city, about her new dorm, and about how her school would allow her to have guests stay with her. She was excited that she was finally living by her own rules. I wanted to cry. I didn’t know what she wanted me to say. I didn’t know what she wanted me to do. She’d earlier told me she thought my pursuing her was a bad idea. She’d said that nothing could ever happen because of our age difference. She’d given me a solid no…twice. After 45 minutes on the phone my mind short-circuited. I couldn’t breathe. A tear ran down my cheek as I told her I was sorry, I’d love to talk more, but I had to go to work. I didn’t really have to go anywhere, but I didn’t want to be on the phone with her and have an emotional breakdown. I prided myself on being unemotional, and I was about to fail. I spent the rest of the day fighting tears, wondering what that whole conversation was all about. Was it just mundane chit chat, or was there more to it? Was there something she wanted me to say, or was she oblivious to how I felt? I’ll never know.  
  
Over the next few months I’d hear from her every once in a while, a random phone call, a message sent with her sister, but contact was limited, and I was able to stay composed through the days and weeks without her presence. I began to feel as though she knew how I felt, and was just having fun tormenting me from a distance; or at least that was the impression I got from her sister. But distance seemed to help, because I could tell myself that I’d never see her again.   
  
Then there she was. Half day of school, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, I walked into the northern wing of the school, and there she was, standing outside the English department office. I wanted to drop my bag, pick her up and never let her go. What I did was say hello with a quip about, after escaping this place, why would she come back? She said she was there to visit her old teachers. I told her that I’d like to talk, but I had to get to English class because I had a quiz to take, then I scurried away…happy to have seen her but dejected that she wasn’t there to see me. I failed that quiz, by the way. Couldn’t concentrate.  After English was over I went to the wrong room for my next class. When the school day was done I got into my car, and a half hour later I looked up and had no idea where I was. I’d gotten lost on the way home. It all just seemed so wrong.  
  
We shared a few more phone conversations over the next few months; she told me how much fun she was having in the city, how many good schools there were in her area, and how many cool people she was meeting. She inquired as to how things were going with the club or where I was thinking of going to school, and what I intended to study. She joked about throwing pastries out her dorm room window at the resident assistant, and making up silly imaginary infomercial products…but it all seemed so empty. When I told her that I was looking at schools across the country she seemed surprised. I told her I had no reason to stay, and nothing keeping me in the area. That was the last phone call we shared.  
  
I saw her once more at school that year. Her sister was in the school play, and I saw her in the audience talking to a friend during intermission. We made eye contact for several seconds, but we didn’t speak. I approached her after the performance, but overheard her being asked if there was anyone else she wanted to see that night. Her reply was no, so I backed away. I didn’t sleep that night. I just sat in the darkness wishing the pain away.  
  
I threw myself into my work, took on new projects, and tried to ignore everything I was feeling. I turned to my friends, and put my energy into helping them through their troubles. I always believed in helping others when I could, and I figured if I could see them through their tough times, maybe The Fates would find a way to help me through mine.  
  
As summer started creeping up, and my graduation day drew near, I began the process of pushing my responsibilities onto those who would be taking my place in the club. I started taking better care of myself, and paying attention to my own hobbies. I needed some research materials for a new personal project I decided to take on so I headed to the book store that I had haunted for the past six years. After searching the shelves for the books I wanted I walked to the checkout counter and looked up from my intended purchases right into her face. She had gotten herself a job at the book store for the summer. It was the first time I’d seen her in months. It felt like a sledgehammer hitting me in the chest. But something was different. She seemed cold…flippant…almost, well, I don’t want to say mean...maybe indifferent would be the best word to use. I said I was surprised to see her, and she said that she had worked at the book store at her college, so it seemed a good fit for a summer job. Then she looked me dead in the eye and said that, now that I knew she was working in the book store she supposed that I would be hanging out there all summer, as though my presence would be a massive burden to her. I made my purchase and walked away without another word. I would not be back.  
  
I graduated a few days later. I’d spent years in recovery trying to get my body working well enough to go back to school, four years working through school, trying to keep up with kids 3 to 7 years younger than myself, building a path forward for the life I wanted. The day I’d worked so hard for had finally come… and it meant less than nothing to me. I should have been excited, elated, jubilant. I wasn’t. It didn’t matter.   
  
That summer was difficult. I actively avoided her at all costs. If I had to go to the mall that contained that bookstore I would look for her car, and refused to go in if she was there. One day I needed to go to the mall to return a gift someone had given me. I carefully checked the parking lot before going in, and it seemed safe, so I entered. After I finished with my business, as I was headed for the door I heard someone call out my name. I turned my head and saw her sister walking through the doorway with the guy I assumed she was dating. A moment later, following her sister, she walked into the mall hand in hand with some guy. I nodded my head in a polite greeting before quickly exiting the building. That was my final visit to the mall that summer.  
  
A month later I was on my way across the country to start my freshman year in college. I should have been excited. I wasn’t. I was heartbroken, depressed, and lost. I hoped the distance would help me heal my battered soul, but I just didn’t feel like myself. I’d worked so hard to regain who I once was; I’d excelled in every undertaking, and now, suddenly, I was empty. I stumbled through my freshman year in college, worked part time as a bouncer at a strip club on the beach, and tried to focus on my own projects, but as the days wore on nothing felt right.   
  
When May returned I finished my finals and made the long drive home. I’d decided that I wasn’t going back; it just wasn’t worth it. I could be depressed at home without it costing me thousands of dollars every year. And at least if I was at home I’d be near my friends, some of whom were also going through tough times. One friend was having a battle with pills. Another was having relationship issues. And one was having all kinds of money and life issues.  
  
I knew I couldn’t fix my own life, but I was always good at helping others, so I took it upon myself to solve everyone else’s issues. I was able to get “Pill Boy” into a rehab facility, and did my best to encourage “Lovesick Lad” and his lady into a relationship. The last one was the toughest. She was a long time friend…and the widow of my best friend. He had died after rolling his Jeep shortly before I started High School. He’d been married less than a year before he died, and he left his wife two months pregnant, and would never get to meet his baby girl. The widow had to move in with her mother just to afford to live. Her mom would watch the baby during the day while the widow worked, and they’d trade off in the afternoon; widow taking the baby while her mom worked at night. But the widow simply wasn’t making enough money to give her little girl a decent life, so she took a second job. That’s where I came in. I’d get off work, drive to their house and pick up the little girl and the widow’s mom. I’d drop mom off at her job and take the baby home with me, babysitting until the widow got out of her second job as a retail worker at the mall. She was working from nine in the morning till ten at night; her only break a thirty minute drive between her two jobs. I’d watch her little one Tuesday through Saturday, and occasionally on Sunday. I’d pick her up, feed her, play with her, read to her, and take her to the mall to meet the widow when her shift was over. The only real problem I had was the fact that someone else also worked a closing shift at the mall.  
  
I still avoided her, but would occasionally see her leaving the building while I waited for the widow to come out and retrieve the little one. That summer seemed to go on forever, but by the end of August the widow had saved up enough money to move herself, her mom, and the little one to Montana where she had been offered a job working for her dead husband’s family. Her in-laws would be able to help with the little one, and the money would be enough to give them both a better life. I encouraged her to go, and offered to help with the move. She thanked me, and took me up on the offer. I helped coordinate with her in-laws, planning her move for February, giving her about six months to pack up, sell the house and find a new place to live close to the family.   
  
In October I decided to get an apartment with the “Lovesick Lad” so he could be near his girlfriend. I was doing my best to ensure that their budding relationship didn’t die on the vine. If I couldn’t be with the one I wanted, I needed to be sure someone could. Yes, they were obnoxious, but they seemed mostly happy, so I did what I could to keep them together.  
  
The New Year came, as did the time for the widow to make her big move. Her mom flew to Montana with the little one, but the widow was driving a big moving truck full of their belongings to the new house. Before she left she decided to visit my apartment for a day. I gave her the tour, showed her some of the trinkets I’d found that her late husband had given me, and introduced her to my newest plaything; my new AOL account. She found the internet fascinating, sitting at my computer for hours. I sat on my bed drawing while she sat at my keyboard playing an AOL game called Slingo while we talked; except she wasn’t really playing Slingo. She was using the internet to track down “you know who”. Using my account she sent an email, hoping to force a conversation. The widow never liked her. She’d met her a couple times at the mall over the summer, tracking her down to see what she was like. Hoping to show me that “she” wasn’t worth my time or heartache, the widow decided to force me to face the situation, rather than avoiding it, as I was.  
  
Amazingly enough, she replied to that email…and it did not go well. We traded a few emails, and eventually I was informed that I had been stalking her all summer. What? Apparently I had been stalking her every night as she was leaving work. Who knew? That accusation crushed me. I thought she knew me better than that. I was so hurt that I didn’t even want to argue…didn’t even want to defend myself, so I just told her what she wanted to hear. I just “confirmed” her suspicions and apologized for the emails, telling her I would no longer contact her, and asking her to consider me dead.  
  
That was the hardest thing I ever had to write. I never thought I could feel that empty. I found myself in a very dark place. All the things I’d done, all those I’d helped, the pride and honor I’d built myself upon…all gone. I began to wish I hadn’t survived the crash that took my arm.   
  
Watching “Lovesick Lad” and his girlfriend fight, make up, fight, and make up again started to enrage me. Watching them together slowly built a wall of resentment around me. Who the fuck was he? What battles did his weak ass ever fight? What blood did he shed? What pain did he endure? What did he do for The Fates to show him favor? Why was he with the one he loved while I was crushed…so far away from the life I wanted; the life I’d earned? I knew it was irrational, but I wasn’t really thinking straight; and wouldn’t be for quite a while. I no longer cared about anyone else’s feelings. I’d grown harder and colder than ever before, determined to never feel that broken again.  
  
I moved on long before I ever let go of the pain and anguish of my interactions with her. Eventually I found someone, got married, and had a little girl of my own. Just as I had finally begun to let go of the past, two days after my thirty-third birthday, I opened up my MySpace page (yeah, I know, I’m old) and found a message from her. After almost ten years…finally believing my heart had healed from being ripped away, here I was reading a message which was dated on my birthday. The woman who had accused me of stalking her…the woman who had broken my heart, crushed my spirit, and burned my honor away, the woman I was finally able to let go of, with one simple message, pulled me back in.  
  
Starting with “Hey, how is life treating you?” and ending with “I’d like to hear back from you if you have a chance…” kind of messed me up. The last time I’d communicated with her, she was pretty adamant that I was stalking her. Now she tracked me down and was messaging me? Who does that?  
  
A lump in my throat, and a 1000 lb. weight in my stomach, I replied to her message, struggling to answer her in vague terms and as politely as possible. Thus began a five month back and forth message storm. It began with ultra-polite “catching-up” messages. We discussed our families, our work, and our current projects. The cloyingly sweet tone of her messages—messages sent to a guy she had accused of stalking—gave me a queasy feeling, so I broke our unspoken protocol of courteous conversation to question why she would message me ten years after accusing me of something so dark. I wanted…needed to know why she would message “her stalker” in this way.  
  
She said she’d seen my profile on someone else’s page, that she always thought of me as “smart nice and cool” despite some of my “sometimes worrisome issues” and that she never believed that I was stalking her. Those close to her, her family and at-the-time boyfriend had tried to convince her that I was a stalker, but she never saw me as a threat. She went on and on as to how she always saw me as somewhat harmless, and never saw me as a stalker. She finally said that she actually thought that I was there in some misguided attempt to protect her because of the late hour and sketchy area. Then she finally asked the reason for my presence.   
  
Her messages didn’t really sit right with me. I didn’t trust her motives. Her sickeningly-sweet messages were too…complementary. That wasn’t the girl I knew. I felt there was something more behind these messages. I also knew telling her the truth would be a waste of time. She had a narrative in her head, and her mind was made up as to why I was there, so I gave her the story she wanted-a gripping tale of someone out to get her from whom I was protecting her. A completely unhinged story that nobody would believe, but fit in with the narrative she had settled upon.   
  
Just the fact that she accepted the story set off alarm bells in my brain. She’s not stupid. She’s not gullible. Clever? Crafty? Absolutely. But she also always had a bit of arrogance to her; always believing she was one step ahead of everyone else. Her replies to my messages, the tone she took, the way she answered my questions while at the same time sidestepping their clear intent was just…I don’t know…off. She was up to something. She had an angle, and I felt like I needed to know what it was.  
  
We went on messaging back and forth for several months, remaining overly polite the whole time. We discussed the projects we were each working on, the issues we each had in our chosen paths. She invited me to see her at a local performance she was giving, though I had to decline. It was difficult enough to exchange messages with her, and I wasn’t sure how I would react to physically being in her presence. Reading her words was one thing, but seeing her, hearing her voice, feeling her presence was not something I was willing to put myself through. I’d achieved some distance, and my suspicions were keeping me on edge. I couldn’t let raw emotion affect my focus. I didn’t want to get sucked back into her orbit.   
  
Then it happened. She cracked. She made a mistake that gave me a big piece of the puzzle I was looking for. Without going into detail, I’ll just say that, though we had discussed the projects we’d each been working on, it became clear that someone else had told her of my project first. She’d contacted me in an effort to learn more about what I was working on, which I was always very vague about. Her mistake was a comment which, in effect, assumed credit for my work. She had done that in the past; taking credit for my work, my ideas, my achievements…and I never challenged her. After ten years, after accusing me of stalking her, after breaking my heart over and over again, I could no longer allow her to assume my work as her own.  When I corrected her, and denied her effort to insinuate herself into my project by pointing out her misconceptions, her messages abruptly stopped. As soon as I challenged her narrative, she became uncommunicative.   
  
We had no contact for several more years, until someone sent me a Facebook post she had made. We had a few brief interactions, but nothing of note. I was over the whole excessively-polite banter we shared on MySpace, and picked apart anything she wrote, challenging her narrative every chance I got. I really wanted her to realize that the narrative she’d adopted wasn’t always reality. Always telling her what she wanted to hear didn’t encourage her to look more critically at the world around her, so I tried challenging her world view. Of course, in the world we live in today, my voice was drowned out by those sharing the hugbox she had constructed for herself.  
  
I had to accept that the person she had been, the girl I loved, was gone, consumed by the twisted, backward narratives of those she chose to associate with. The chemistry between us, the connection we shared, visible to many around us, had been disregarded. I accepted that she made a choice to ignore the bond I know she felt between us. She made a choice; and she didn’t choose me. Mrs. L was finally proven wrong. Time ran out long ago, and she never came ‘round. There will always be a part of me that loves her. I’ll always wish I’d done things differently. I miss who she was, and I mourn what could have been, but I still wish her only the best in the life she has chosen, even if it is without me.  
  
Why am I writing this? Call it therapy. Call it my need to bleed my pain upon the paper. Call it my desire to write the story down to encourage others not to make the mistakes I made. I can see the end of my story approaching. I know it’s almost over for me. I’ll succumb to my injuries and health issues sooner rather than later, and I can only wish my tale can encourage those who see their future in the eyes of another to take that step forward, to lean in, to drop the bag and embrace their destiny. Take the chance, because if you don’t, you’ll regret it till you take your final breath. As I await my final gasp I can’t help but wonder…is my vision as clear as I believe it to be? Or am I only seeing what I need to see as I cross the finish line? Sadly, I’ll never know.

My experiences are not incredibly unique and are in no way the worst-case scenario. These stories and snippets of memories will be accounting mostly for family fighting, my depression and anxiety, and my feelings throughout all of it.

**The Religious Fights**

In my freshman year of high school, actually, the summer after were the first fights.  These, I call the Religious Fights.  I don’t remember much from these fights.  I mainly remember how I felt.  Again, I wasn’t as insightful as I am [REDACTED_NAME], I had much to learn, as I still do.  The religious fights started with my request to drop my Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD)  class, otherwise known as Catechism.  This request would also include me not getting confirmed in the church.

Of course, this was not an easy fight.  My parents really didn’t understand why it was so important to me that I stop going to church and not get confirmed.  And to be completely fair, I didn’t really know how to articulate any of my feelings.  I did my best to explain why I didn’t like the church without being offensive or out of line.  I explained in my best 15-year-old words, that I felt guilty from when I used to go to church and the Catholic school and had views and beliefs that contradicted my current beliefs and moral compass.  I absolutely hated going to church and CCD.  I hated believing one thing and being forced into a religion that went against exactly my beliefs.

I remember one night in particular when I was sitting at our kitchen island.  My dad and I were arguing, him angrily doing dishes, me crying on a kitchen stool.  Trying to find the words to explain trauma to your conservative parents is not easy in the least, but I did my best.  I consulted with my aunt (number 1)  throughout the series of fights, and she told me to write how I’m feeling, to be very respectful, and maybe find a church that I’d enjoy.  I thought that was reasonable and easy enough.  I wrote how I felt, the most respectfully I could, and mentioned trying to look for a desirable church.

Eventually, we came to an agreement, and by agreement I mean my dad telling me to “do what I want,” meaning no church, and with me not holding up my end of the bargain.  I never looked into new churches.  I never really intended to.  I was very much having doubts about my religion.  Both parties, my parents and I, left the fights hurt, misunderstood, and maybe 2% better at communicating.

During one of these small late-night fights, I got overwhelmed, so my sister and I went to my aunt (number 2), to calm down.  I was very grateful for this experience, my aunt simply consoled me, fed me ice cream, and asked minimal questions.  With future experiences, I would grow to be more thankful for this.  The church fights were particularly difficult for me, as my sister was scarcely involved.  She had already been confirmed and was already or nearly 18, so she had nothing to fight for.  She already didn’t need to go to church.  I also spoke my opinion and pleaded to not go to church, so that if my younger siblings felt the same as me in the future, my parents wouldn’t be blindsided, and my siblings would have a chance to voice their opinions.

**Dropping out**

I’ve struggled with anxiety probably all of my life, but it got significantly worse after Covid.  We went back to school in the fall of 2020.  I, unfortunately, wasn’t mentally prepared.  I tried to go back and made it about a quarter and a half into the school year.  My first panic attack happened during this time and I started convincing my mom to let me homeschool myself.  Eventually, it worked and we started working on unenrolling me.  For about a week I wasn’t in school and I wasn’t doing school, eventually, I got on track and figured out a curriculum.  But working on schoolwork would be an uphill battle for the next two and a half years.

**Tarot Night**

Another important event in the timeline of things is a “tarot night” with my aunt (number 3,) my uncle, and my sister.  At the time, my sister was far more into tarot and spirituality than I, so she was doing the readings.  The night didn’t start that way.  We were just stopping at my aunt’s house to chat or drop something off.  I remember my sister and aunt talking and getting the idea of doing tarot, I remember us getting very excited to do readings.  We ran back out to the car to grab my sister’s stuff.

Once we came back in, we got to talking about a lot of stuff.  We (my aunt, my sister, and I) all talked about mental health, specifically mine, tarot cards, crystals, the universe, religion, and our parents.  We all just ranted a lot, talked very honestly and just had a fun time.  We started the tarot readings, starting with my aunt first.  She found it very accurate and insightful and we chatted about the cards she got.  Then it was my uncle's turn for a reading.  He was very skeptical and even fearful of the readings.  My sister started pulling cards for him, he joked about not wanting to get the “death” card, and he sat down.  In the reading, she did indeed pull the “death” card and we chatted about what that actually meant.  He found his reading very accurate as well and was freaking out a little bit because of it.

Next, it was my turn, and I was already shaking with adrenaline and excitement.  My sister started pulling cards for me, and now I can’t remember which cards they were exactly.  I do, however, remember that they were very accurate with what was happening in my life.  Earlier that day we had talked about how I felt, (and feel), very connected to the moon always.  She pulled the ‘Moon’ card in her deck.  She and I freaked out, she was mainly laughing, and I got super paranoid, but it was all a good time.  We were extremely excited that they were all very accurate to each of us individually.  We chatted some more, talked about the readings, talking about how crazy it felt.  I’d had her do readings on me, but none were that extremely accurate.  All of the cards she pulled for me directly talked about or related to the things we were talking about before tarot cards got involved.

I can’t exactly grasp or explain precisely how it felt, but it was an amazing night.  My sister and I felt understood, and excited to do more tarot readings with our aunt and uncle.  It was a very significant night for me personally and would have a bit of significance later on.  I’d never been as close to this aunt as my sister was, but I felt like I was that night, and it was great.  It was much easier to talk to her when my sister was with me.  I had been (almost) completely transparent with her, as much as I could with an adult, and it didn’t feel like I would regret it.

**Big Fights**

There was one “big fight” that was very significant.  It’s the first fight I can kind of recall.  My sister and I had just gotten home, she used to do DoorDash, and I used to ride along to chat, listen to music, and kind of just look out for her.  It was football season and we had gotten home very late, and we had talked a lot about how we felt about our parents and whatnot.  I dropped my blankets and backpack next to the bathroom and saw that my younger brother was in the living room watching the TVs.  One of them being my TV, from my room upstairs.  So, I aggressively asked him why he had it, he explained, and I asked him to take up my TV while I went to the bathroom.  While I was in the bathroom, I heard my brother and sister arguing because he refused to take up my TV.

Things escalated quickly, once I got out of the bathroom I followed the argument upstairs to my brother's room.  They quickly got into it, fighting for unnecessary reasons, all of us getting very riled up and angrier by the minute.  He still refused to bring my TV up and just kept telling us to get out of his room.  My sister and I escalated the situation and went to wake up our dad.  We both thought he’d agree with us, but when he woke up he was angry at us.  Angry both because we woke him up and he was siding with my brother.  He informed us that he told my brother to take my TV down there.  We went on to argue about it not only being about the TV.  We were upset about other things as well as just wanting our brother to not be an ass.

We moved the argument to the kitchen and tried to get through it all.  There wasn’t much listening between anyone, and my brother was getting angrier by the minute.  My sister and I were getting angrier and angrier about how our brother was getting out of trouble so easily.  My sister and I felt that we were both getting into trouble all the time for very minor things.  We felt like we were constantly disappointing everyone, and not being truly seen.

The argument expanded to more than just my brother not being helpful.  My sister and I started talking about how we were feeling, and us feeling unwelcome and under-appreciated.  This, of course, is not a fun thing for parents to hear, and not a fun thing to misunderstand either.  Our parents misunderstood our words for criticism, and we misunderstood their anger as not caring.  The fight ended with three out of four of us in tears, and not much being accomplished.  My sister used the line “I don’t feel welcome in this home,” which stuck around for months and months and maybe even years later.  As she choked out those words, I started silently balling as well.  This made our mom ultimately ask if I felt the same way, which I did.  I felt the same way as my sister, but looking back the way she worded it was not exactly *how* we felt.  But it was the best we had.

This was the most significant fight that I can remember, it kind of jump-started everything into extremely fast motion.  I remember the exhausting feeling of actually speaking about my thoughts and feelings for the first time ever.  I remember the feeling of just shaking and crying on a stool in the kitchen.  Nearly unable to make eye contact with either parent and almost verbally incapable.  After this fight, everything went to hell.

**Unwanted Text Messages**

The very next day, I was in Spanish II.  I remember this day very vividly and regrettably so.  My sister was the teacher’s assistant for that class period, so we basically always spent that class speaking in our secret eye language.  That day I wasn’t doing too well, with the night before stuck in my brain, I did my best to keep my head down and just get through the day.   I planned on going home and doing my best to relax, but that plan was quickly diminished.

Once I got the first text, I felt so clouded.  I didn’t know how to respond for one, and I felt totally and completely betrayed.  My aunt (3) texted my sister and me in a group chat with the three of us.  I knew she didn’t mean any sort of harm, but at the time it was more than unexpected.  She asked us why we were feeling the way we were feeling.  Which was confusing in a number of ways.  On one hand, I felt that we had talked about it, enough for her to know, when we did the tarot readings.  The tarot reading night had been a week, maybe two prior.  Did she not listen?  On the other hand, it was confusing because my sister and I had never articulated how we felt.  And certainly not over text in Spanish class.  Now I could talk about what was all said, I have all of the texts still, but that anger and those feelings don’t need to be dug up.  The significance of this though, is the utter and total betrayal we felt.  Again we had talked to our aunt about nearly all of the stuff we were upset about and she ‘forgot’ it all.  She acted as though she was protecting our mom from us.  Isolating.  She didn’t need protecting from us.  She needed to listen.  They needed to listen.

In the text exchanges my sister and I explained how we were feeling with the most respect we could, and without talking about specific situations.  We didn’t have specific situations that we were upset about, we wanted someone to listen to us.  We wanted someone to hear us.  Our aunt talked about how she knew how it felt to be a mother, and that we shouldn’t criticize her.  My sister and I were baffled that it had come to this.  Our supposed to-be trusted aunt texting us after a terrible night to bug us more about the terrible things.

I remember my sister and I exchanging looks throughout the class, and both of us just immediately knowing how the other was feeling.  The betrayal was unmistakable.  I plopped my head down on my desk and did my best to stop the tears from running down my cheek.  Everything was overwhelming and I wasn’t able to handle it all.  I didn’t understand it at all.

A few more texts went back and forth between the three of us, I only texted once I had thought everything through and not in class.  I did my best to not have a panic attack in school but was severely failing.

The texts went on for the whole day and maybe even on into the next, I don’t quite remember.  They dragged on and did nothing good.  Tensions rose.  Texts can’t be read correctly and even worse so in an argument or a situation like this.  After a while, the shaking and crying, and anxiety attacks died down with the texts.  But the anger lingered.  They lingered for quite some time.

**Big No - No** 

For a while, I had been struggling with my mental health.  I didn’t know what I was doing wrong, I didn’t understand why I wasn’t getting better.  I stayed in bed 24/7, and binge-watched shows for days.  My room was a disaster always.  I had dirty dishes lying everywhere, clothes everywhere.  I wasn’t doing well.  My mind was fighting against itself.  Every day was an uphill battle.  I was at my lowest yet.

I got into an argument with my mom, and I can’t even recall what it was about now.  I do know that I was angry and acting out.  I must not have been listening to my mom because she called my dad to come and talk to me as well.  I was lying in bed when they barged into my room and started yelling at me.  Did I deserve it?  That is quite possible, but I didn’t need both of them there getting after me.

They started taking my things away, they started taking my iPad, phone, and TV away.  I argued that if they wanted to take my stuff away, they’d have to pay me for it.  I bought my things, how was it their right to take them away?  They claimed they were helping me and that phones and media were clouding my judgment and influencing me in bad ways.  I kept arguing and making them mad, and it escalated.  I asked why he was doing this or something like that and he said something along the lines of “Cuz I know how you kids think,” and I nearly yelled, “REALLY?! YOU KNOW THAT I WANT TO DIE?!”  Which was probably not what I should have said.

They told me we were going to the ER.  They kind of flipped out.  And I just started having many panic attacks.  It freaked me out, I said something finally, broke finally.  But I didn’t say exactly what I was feeling, I said what would get attention.  I said what would get me help finally.  I felt like they were going to lock me up.  Looking back, I’m sure that’s a scary thing to hear as a parent.  As a kid, however, it felt like no one was listening, and it told me that I had to scream and cry and say extreme things to get help or attention.

**Yet Another Fight**

**\***For some background, in between fights, my sister had written to my parents about everything she and I were feeling, and in this, she came out as gay.\*

One night my younger sister (sister 3), came into my room after having a night terror.  So, she and I talked for a while, lying in my bed.  We talked about her school and her day, and I made sure she knew that the only “monsters” that existed were people.  I told her this to try to make her less scared.  Monsters are much more scary than people.  Right?  I also talked her up, and complimented her, telling her how perfect she is.  I told her to never let anyone tell her any different.

We fell asleep and I didn’t think to move her to her bed in the night, I didn’t want her having another nightmare while I was asleep.  When we woke up, I sent her to get ready for school, and then Mom came into the room.  She started asking me what we had talked about the night prior, and as an angry kid, I denied her the information.  I said things along the line of “You don’t need to know” and “Why does it matter.”  This of course escalated things greatly.

Throughout the day, Mom and Dad grilled me about what we had talked about, insisting that I was trying to “teach” her something or “push my agenda.”  I kept pushing the point of her being my sister, and my right to speak to her in private.  I didn’t understand why I was being seen as the enemy.  I had a conversation with my sister, was that so bad?

The next day, a few of my siblings and a couple of our cousins went to our dad’s work storage building.  Once they got back, my sister (3) came to me and told me about inappropriate images and conversations that had been seen and said at the building.  Seeing that this was not my place to talk with her about I went to bring it to my parents.

This pissed my mom off.  She thought that I was trying to parent my sister.  She was upset that I was a safe space for my sister.  I, of course, thought this ridiculous.  My sister was having nightmares, I’d rather her come talk to me than be scared and alone.  My mom told me that the moment I “endangered” her daughter, (my sister,) I was no longer her daughter, I was a threat.  I was dumbfounded.  That was the most outrageous thing I’d ever heard.  I was a danger?  How dare she?  I was being a sister, I was being a friend.  I was in no way endangering her.  I wanted privacy, I wanted basic respect from my parents.  Was purposefully keeping the conversation private a bad choice?  Probably.  But I didn’t deserve this, I didn’t deserve becoming a stranger.  I escalated the argument to more than just my younger sister.  I brought up the church and how it was homophobic.  I said many hurtful things about their parenting, saying they were in the wrong for continuing to take their kids to a homophobic church.  Especially when their second oldest child was gay and they knew.

My older sister then came in after work, to pick me up.  She worked for DoorDash, and I used to go with her.  As she walked in and stopped next to me, I was so angry I was just spewing words and questions.  I asked, “How can you go to and send your kids to that church when you know it’s homophobic?”  I also simply told them that they were homophobic, that that made them homophobic.  They didn’t like this at all.

Push came to shove, I’m not sure exactly how it got there, but Mom said that she didn’t necessarily believe or agree “with the lifestyle.”  It was point-blank.  She didn’t support my sister.  She didn’t support me.  In that moment, I didn’t recognize my mother.  And it took a hell of a long time to recognize her again.  My sister and I left the house in a rage and in tears.  We drove to the city in which she DoorDashed.  It was a forty-five-minute ride and we spent the most of it sobbing.  By the time we could catch a breath, we talked about leaving, about turning eighteen and moving away, and how hard it would be leaving the kids.  We talked about how we were feeling about Mom and the entire situation.  I remember feeling sick, wanting to puke.  I felt unloved, I felt betrayed.  It wasn’t fair.  I didn’t deserve this.  My sister didn’t deserve this.

**Therapy**

After several discussions and arguments, they agreed to get me in therapy.  My mom picked a therapist for me, which I wasn’t crazy about, but it was much better than nothing.  She called and set up a first appointment for sometime in the beginning of summer.  Things died down during the wait for therapy, and I got very into journaling.  I would journal every day about my intentions and gratitudes.  Soon I started writing about everything that was going on in my life.

I don’t remember all of my first therapy session, but I’m pretty sure it was uneventful.  I believe I only answered questions and filled out paperwork.  My therapist told me at the end of the hour that I would only have to be in therapy for three months.  I didn’t really know how to feel about this.  I didn’t think much of it after a while, I thought it was working.  It felt like it was working.  I’d go to therapy every Wednesday or every other Wednesday.  Mom would drive me, and we would sit in silence for about 25 minutes.  She would go get groceries or run errands for an hour while I was at my appointment.

My therapist would give me thinking strategies, and productivity strategies, as well as teaching me about why my brain was the way it was.  She asked me if I “had a plan,” as in to end my life, and I said of course not.  I didn’t.  I only wanted to get better, that’s what I was doing there.  I didn’t ever really get very in-depth with my therapist.  She would mainly guess what I was feeling and then ask me questions.  She was usually always right, but I just didn’t feel that comfortable with her.

She could tell pretty quickly that I was tense around my mom.  I didn’t really want to talk about that at the time.  I was focused on getting myself better and not necessarily fixing things with my mom.  My therapist could tell I was hesitant, but almost every session she’d ask if I wanted to have an appointment with my mom, and every time I’d tell her that I didn’t think I was ready.  I wanted to get better but I was still angry.  I could get better and still be angry right? 

**Memoo**

One morning, Mom had told me to get my younger brothers ready to go to our aunt’s (3) house.  My mom was in school to become a midwife, and I was homeschooled, so neither of us could handle the boys that day.  So, I woke up and got the kids ready to go to my aunt’s.  I got them clothed before myself, and soon enough my grandma was there to pick them up.

It was a nice sunny day out, so I walked out with the boys to my grandma.  I sent them to her from the deck in my PJs.  She put the boys in her jeep and started for her door.  She stood outside her door and started yelling at me.  She started saying things like “Is there a reason you can’t watch kids?”  As well as things like “You’re so disrespectful,” and whatnot.  I was overwhelmed and confused as to why I was getting cussed out.  I had never seen my grandma get so angry like that, especially at me.  My grandma, (and grandpa,) had been a safe bet through all of the fights.  They stayed mainly neutral and my sister and I could talk to them a little about everything.  This felt like a betrayal and I didn’t want to talk to them anymore, I couldn’t trust them.

After Memoo left, I made a point to text her about how I was feeling.  I told her it was unfair that she was yelling at me when she wasn’t informed about what was going on.  I told her that Mom had told me to get the boys ready to go to our aunt’s.  I told her that it was hard enough to be in all of the fights and now therapy and that she ultimately didn’t have a right to yell at me.  She responded with an apology and an explanation.  She told me that her “bucket was full” and some other things.  I blew it off and didn’t think much of it, but looking back, Memoo was the last person my sister and I felt we could trust, and that trust felt lost after that.

Remembering this now, I am [REDACTED_NAME] proud of myself for standing up for myself.  Even though I couldn’t say anything in the moment, I didn’t let her walk all over me.  I was already feeling like everyone was in our business, so this made things worse.  It was hard enough to feel like nothing was changing between me and my sister and my parents, but to have everyone watching and judging us as well, that was too much.

**A Difference**

Therapy seemed to have been working and things with the parents were dying down.  It was summertime and I was very productive.  I was using the techniques my therapist gave me, and I was steering clear of problems with my parents.  Everything seemed to be going well.  I was also feeling very optimistic about my future and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.

I was excited about getting better and couldn’t wait to find out where I was going.  I knew before therapy that I wasn’t doing well but I always held on to the fact that I had hope and I had a plan to get better.  I always kept a plan, I wanted to travel, figure out college, and find something that I truly loved to do.  The first step to all of that was getting better.  Easy enough.  Therapy should do the trick, right?  I guess I would find out.

A friend of mine and I hadn’t hung out in a while, but when we did that summer we got into some heavy conversations.  We talked about how scared we were to move away and “leave” our siblings.  We bonded over our extreme love for our siblings and the fear of betraying them.  We talked a lot about our pasts and traumas.  I filled her in with everything that had gone down with my parents over the past three years, and all of it was pretty familiar to her.

We talked about our younger selves and I told her about my mental health problems even as a child.  I told her how I had low self-esteem even as a kid.  I talked about my older siblings and how they were when we were younger.  I told her how long I’d felt how I was feeling.  We cried a lot, and it ultimately made us a lot closer.  She had been an inspiration and a role model for me all throughout my childhood and I was glad I was friends with her.  I was sad that we were bonding over traumas like this and not over common interests and favorite shows.

**Family Vacation**

Family vacation was such a bittersweet experience each time.  This time, however, it was very raw.  I love traveling, but family drama is legit the worst.  Our family vacations consist of our extended family.  Our whole family, ten kids, Mom and Dad, all of our cousins and their parents, and my maternal grandparents.  That brings it to about thirty of us.  We’re a big group.  We all drive and stay at an AirBnB, and do things like hike, shop around at local shops and towns, etc.  My sister and I always stick together during family trips, and try to steer clear of any drama.  We’re usually pretty good.  This one, however, didn’t go so well.  My oldest brother, the prodigy of the family, was leaving for basic training, so there was some tension for the last few days of the trip.

On the way home my grandparents, one of my aunts (1), my older sister and both of my younger sisters stayed at another AirBnB before going home the next day.  During our stay there, Memoo and our aunt got into a very heated argument.  I mean like yelling and screaming.  I’m not quite sure what they were arguing about but they were getting into it.  Eventually, everyone went to bed and all of us sisters settled in the living room on the pull-out.  My older sister and I chatted until late that night talking about how crappy it was that they were yelling in front of the kids.  My younger sisters were like 11 and 8.

We talked a lot about how the adults in our lives needed to learn to communicate.  We were super frustrated that we were better at communicating than any of them.  The next day was very tense, we didn’t know how to feel or act.  None of us were sure if everyone was completely cooled down.  This angered me more.  There was no good reason for adults to yell at each other.  It was ridiculous.

**Decisions**

Some months after vacation, I decided to quit my job.  I needed to focus on school rather than making money.  I had already lessened my hours greatly, but I also just didn’t enjoy my job.  I stopped working there in December or January.  I started a new part-time job in the beginning of January but I knew to not take too many hours.

My parents were always getting on me about my financial situation.  Now, they were always fair about this.  I needed to be called out.  At the time, however, I felt overwhelmed.  I didn’t want to worry about that, I didn’t want to be constantly yelled at all the time.  I wanted to relax and not get constantly ridiculed.  I can see now that they wanted to help and teach responsibility, but I thought I was responsible.  It was frustrating at the time because I didn’t feel like they were giving me enough attention in other more serious matters, but they were grilling me about my money situation.  It felt targeted and unnecessary.

Of course, it didn’t help the situation when I did quit working for my dad.  My dad didn’t really understand why I needed to focus on myself and school.  And to be fair, I didn’t really feel like explaining it at all, so there was no way he would understand it.  My financial state kept getting worse and worse, and so did the pressure from my parents.  I didn’t understand why they cared so much about my money and not about how I was feeling or doing mentally.  Looking back, there wasn’t much for them to worry about other than money when I didn’t ever tell them how I was feeling.  But it created pressure and tension nonetheless.

**My Aunt**

Aunt (number 3) became quite the villain in my and my sister's lives.  Neither of us felt like we could trust her and for the most part, we just steered clear of her.  It wasn’t too hard, we both pretty much stayed in our rooms all the time and the only time we saw our aunt was at family events like birthdays or holidays.  Our aunt pretty frequently went off on my sister.  One time in particular, my sister was preparing to tour a college and asked our dad to go with her.  She did this because our dad is who we usually ask to do things like that.  Mom doesn’t really do stuff like that with us.  I’ve always thought our dad was more reasonable than our mom.

Our aunt called my sister and cussed her out for not inviting our mom to the college visit.  She said my sister was selfish and didn’t think of our mom’s feelings.  She went on and on about how our mom tries very hard with us and deserves our respect.  Under different circumstances maybe this would have been warranted or even made sense.  But it was nothing about Mom or disrespecting her.  Our aunt just didn’t know the whole story.  Our dad has always shown more interest in things like that, and my sister knew that.  There wasn’t an agenda.  There was no intent to make Mom feel bad, and she didn’t ask to go, she never said anything.

**Religion**

Religion was a big thing with my parents.  There were many times that I brought up being mentally ill and they told me it was caused by my lack of religion.  This was confusing to hear when I felt I needed professional help.  Hearing that I simply needed God or Jesus made me feel like a failure.  Something that I used to believe would help me?  Something that helps so many other people couldn’t help me?  If I could believe I would.  How easy it would be to believe.  Maybe it would help me, but there was no way it could.  I couldn’t believe, and I can’t believe still.  I understand now, of course, that my parents believe in their God so much and they want me to have that.  They wanted to help, and they thought they were doing so.

**Wrist**

My wrist is something that has bothered me for years.  It will get irritated when I overuse it, and then it’s nearly unusable for weeks.  Most of the time this is just annoying, but it did start to cause problems and even mental distress.  I am a very artistic person and it became hard to do what I loved.  I asked and asked and asked my parents for an appointment to get it checked out, and it took an extreme amount of time for us to find the time.  Eventually, I got an appointment and we found out it was tendinitis.  Which was extremely unhelpful.  We got me a wrist brace and went on with our lives.  But it became increasingly hard to not be able to do what I love.  Painting and drawing have always been an escape for me, and not being able to do that took a toll on me.

**A Future**

Some time passed, things died down, and things got back to almost normal.  There were still some definite tensions and things left unsaid, but everyone had things to do and lives to get back to.  Including myself.  As much as all of that had sucked I too, got busy.  I was getting more busy with my school and choir stuff.  I began to overwork myself and not pay attention to my needs.  I wasn’t taking breaks or taking care of myself properly, and was just burnt out.

After some time I was busying myself so much I wasn’t even allowing myself to feel emotions.  I was swinging between extreme thoughts and feelings and having no feelings.  I kept getting lower and lower.  At the time I didn’t think I was that low but looking back, I was the lowest I’d ever been.  I was having many dark and intrusive thoughts and many panic attacks.  I thought it would be easier and better if I wasn’t around anymore.  I didn’t think I deserved to keep going, I didn’t think I was contributing enough.  I needed a lot of help.

My panic attacks were scary.  I didn’t really know what they were, or why they were happening.  I would be in show choir practice and it was like something in me would flip.  I would look around and everything was too loud and silent at the same time.  It felt like when you stand up too fast and get dizzy, but then that feeling wouldn’t go away.  I knew almost immediately every single time and excused myself to the locker room.  I can remember sitting on the concrete with my entire body shaking.  I’ve heard people talk about their panic attacks and how they black out and don’t remember anything.  Not me.  I remember every second of my panic attacks and how I felt.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] qualified to say which is worse but remembering can be a curse.  Not understanding why you’re panicking and why you can’t calm yourself is scary.

Never before in my life had I not known how I was feeling.  Being at a loss for breath is a new feeling that I wouldn’t wish upon anyone.  There were many days that I had panic attacks that I just had to leave practice early.  I would go home and just cry and cry and pass out.  It was exhausting.  Show choir was beginning to add to the stress of my regular life rather than be a fun thing, and an escape.

It didn’t take long before I hit very very low.  If I didn’t have great friends I’m not sure where I’d be today.  I got to a place where I didn’t care about anything.  I was so numb to my feelings and my surroundings.  I stopped eating and started to hurt myself.  Looking back I think I just wanted and needed control in my life.  I hated the routine that was my life.  Any time I thought I did something wrong or embarrassing I would tell myself I didn’t deserve to eat.  Didn’t finish homework?  Hungry?  Too bad.  I started waiting for anyone, anyone in the world to notice.  But that was unfair because I was unwilling and too embarrassed to tell anyone.  The only people who knew the state I was in, were the people who *saw* it.

I would write in my journal about how I was feeling every once in a while.  I explained it like this:  I’ve been depressed before, I’ve been low before, but I’ve always had hope and I’ve always seen a future for myself.  But at this time, I didn’t see that.  I had no ideas or hopes or dreams.  Nothing seemed like enough to live for.  I wasn’t living for myself.  I was alive because I didn’t have the guts to leave my loved ones.  I didn’t have the guts to not be there for my siblings, for my friends.  It got to the point where I was having panic attacks every night.  I didn’t know how to get better.  I was asking for therapy again and getting radio silence from my parents.

I was worried about what I would do.  My thoughts were scaring me.  How could I think those things about myself?  How could I be so mean to myself?  Did I deserve to feel this way?  Was it my fault?  It had to be, right?  I told myself I was doing it for the attention, but then where was the attention?  I was so low and no one saw me?  I moved everywhere like there were chains on my feet like I had actual weights on my shoulders.  No one talks about how dark and how hard it is to be depressed, how ugly it is.  Not eating, not showering, not sleeping, sleeping too much, it’s not pretty.  How could I let myself get this low?  I was supposed to be the one no one worried about.  Why did I want to be worried about?  I was letting everyone down by being unwell.  I needed to get better on my own.  After some time I realized the hard truth that no one was coming to save me.  I needed to save me.

**Getting Better**

This last summer my friends, sister, and I all went on a road trip to Colorado.  This trip was extremely enlightening and just an amazing experience.  Only a few months after my lowest point, we went on this trip, and I’m so grateful we did.  It didn’t feel very groundbreaking at the time, but once we got back, everything felt very in perspective.

Things started looking up after that.  I figured out how much school I had left to complete, I decided to stop doing show choir, I started working more as a barista, and started doing more of my hobbies.  I started to love life again.  I became more and more productive and started taking care of myself better.  There wasn’t a definite ‘cure’ to my mental illnesses.  It was a gradual turn of events.  I didn’t even notice I was getting better.  Eventually, when people asked me how I was doing, I didn’t have to lie when I said I was doing good.  It was relieving.

I’ve grown so much since all of this, the last six months alone felt like a lifetime.  My mentality has matured exponentially in these last few years.  I’ve learned to see things from all perspectives and understand where people are coming from.  I’ve learned from all of these experiences.  I believe that you can learn something from every person you meet and every experience you have.

I’ve learned to be proud of myself.  I brought myself up from that awful place.  I got myself better.  I started taking care of myself, and it wasn’t easy.  I deserve props for that.  I went through a lot, maybe not as much as others, but for me?  A lot.  There is much more I left unsaid, untouched, but this is the most of it.  I’ve learned so much from all of this, learned things I’ll be able to use later on in life.  I’ve learned that communication is so so important and that lack of communication can destroy people and relationships.  I’ve learned that people are usually not evil even if they seem that way in the moment, most are just misunderstood.  I’ve learned a lot about myself, how I recharge, what triggers me, and how to regulate my feelings on my own.  I’ve learned to take care of myself properly, eating better, and starting skin care.  I’ve learned that anxiety is not something you can ‘cure’ but something you learn to cope and live with.  Things that feel small and insignificant, but would have been so helpful years ago.

I can’t say that these things were fun to go through, but I don’t regret them happening.  Learning to love life again was a beautiful thing.  Getting excited over small things again is a beautiful thing.  Sometimes you need to get knocked down lower than you’ve ever been to stand up taller than you ever were.  I don’t think I’d appreciate life as much as I do now if I hadn’t gone through what I did.  I’d rather these experiences be behind me and all these lessons learned rather than have to be learned later on.  A lot of kids don’t have to go through all that, and a lot of kids go through more,  but a lot of kids don’t get the chance to learn those lessons, and I’m lucky to have.  Life is just a collection of experiences, good and bad, and everything in between.  You don’t get to pick and choose.",6
g4o74x,1587366981.0,2020-04-20 07:16:21,stories,My Story- From Breaking The Rules To Breaking My Back,"I had lived my life on the edge since I was 14, having no fear, no regret and never believing that my actions have consequences. I liked to drink. I liked breaking the rules. I liked that I got away with it. That was until I reached 17 and karma came back to bite me. New Years Eve is a time to celebrate and have fun. I took it one step too far that night. I changed the life that I will never get back. I was at the pub, drinking, partying and having a great time. What’s the harm in that? I was enjoying myself until I was asked to leave. Blind drunk, I walked home. Right around the corner. I unlocked the front door and climbed up the stairs to my flat. The night wasn’t over for me. I walked to the balcony, climbed over the railings and stumbled along the roof towards the awning. I had done it before. What could go wrong? Walking along the awning, looking down at everyone outside the pub, I thought I was invincible. I started to walk closer and closer to the end of the awning. I remember feeling the panic and desire to turn back. I was having too much fun to turn back. Then…. It all went dark.

I hit the back of my neck on the brick awning as I fell, legs first, 7 meters to the footpath below. The back of my head landed hard on the fuse box of the butcher’s roof, ripping the flesh away from my skull and badly splitting my skull. My spine was severed as I fell, and my tail bone and sternum were broken. Then, landing legs first on the footpath, I split my femurs on both legs and shattered my wrist and broke my tail bone as I hit down face first. 

I started to go into shock from major internal bleeding in my abdomen and brain. My legs were badly crushed. Part of my spinal cord was severed, my back broken, along with my tail bone and sternum. My wrist was snapped, separating the bones. My skull crushed so badly that the only thing keeping me alive at the time was Andrew’s hands holding it in place. He saved my life that night. My heart was beating slower and slower by the second, while I was fighting to stay alive. No pulse. No breath. No light at the end of the tunnel. Just darkness as everything got colder. An oxygen tube was put down my throat and the defibrillator turned on. THUD….. No pulse. THUD………. Nothing. My heart had stopped beating. There was no more pain and no more fear. Just as I was about to slip away from this world, with one last thud, my heart started beating again, with a pulse so weak that the only thing keeping me alive was the oxygen tube down my throat and the hand holding my skull together. From that second on, every step they took was vital to keeping me alive. Carefully putting me onto the stretcher, I was taken in the ambulance to the Orange Base Hospital, stopping only once on the way when my heart stopped beating. It was midnight when I was taken into emergency, the nurses and doctors seeing something they would only have seen in horror movies. They x-rayed me to see the extent of my injuries, stopped the bleeding, and once I was stabilized, I was airlifted by Care Flight to The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney.

That night, my father received a phone call on my behalf. “Your daughter has fallen off the roof”. He was working in Victoria at the time and had to drive 7 hours to Sydney, all the while with the thought going through his mind that I might be dead. It still hurts me to know the pain I put him through. I was placed into an induced coma for 3 weeks. My body’s fight for survival was not yet over. My veins were pumped with drugs to paralyze my muscles and keep me alive. That would not have been enough if I had lost my will to live. My heart stopped beating on a number of occasions, but I was not ready to die. A tracheotomy (breathing tube) was inserted down my wind pipe. The long tube acted as my lungs until I learnt how to breathe by myself again. My brain developed a subdural hematoma, (bleeding and swelling in the brain) and my skull had to be drilled to relieve the pressure. My father was there the whole time. My injuries were so severe that the doctors thought it best to turn off the life support, saying the best case scenario IF I was to wake up, I would be paralyzed from the neck down and severely brain damaged. My father took that the worst, telling them not to touch the machines. My brother drove 4 hours to Sydney every weekend to sit by my bed, his hand on mine. “Wake up. Please. Just wake up”. I could feel his hand some times and I wanted to squeeze back to let him know I was there. I wanted to talk and wanted to move. I didn’t know where I was or what was happening. But I was never alone. My best friends came to see me there. As I was fast asleep, they said goodbye, not knowing if I would ever wake up. I was under strong drugs to keep me in a coma while my body was recovering. After 3 weeks, the drugs I was under began to be slowly reduced to wake me up. After 5 weeks, I was stable enough to go to surgery where I was operated on for 12 hours. My femurs on both legs had developed hematomas (swollen muscle and bone growth) from being in traction for 5 weeks. Because I was bedridden for so long, my legs had begun to heal out of place and had to be re-broken for them to correctly heal. Titanium rods were inserted inside both legs from my hips to my knees. Small pins were inserted inside my broken wrist to let the break set in place. My neck had been in a brace for 5 weeks which had built a mark under my chin, leaving a permanent scar. A rod was put inside the back of my neck to hold it together. A large scar now follows down my neck where the rod was put in. My sternum was put in place to heal. There was not much that could be done to help fix the 2 fractured C4-5 vertebrae in my spine. My skull was put back in place and the torn flesh was sown back together. After spending 5 weeks in intensive care at The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, I was transferred to Royal North Shore Hospital to begin my rehabilitation. I spent 7 weeks there, having to learn everything all over again. How to talk, drink, eat, swallow, write, draw, read, and even how to smile. I remember every night there, dad by my bed side, telling me what had happened. What I had done to myself. Crying with me every night. I didn’t fully understand what was going on. I had to piece it together bit by bit, knowing that I may never walk again, and that it was all my fault. Because of that one night. “What could go wrong?” I asked myself. I had visits from friends and family while I was there. I was still recovering from post traumatic stress, so my memory of it is still quite fuzzy. I went to physio 5 days a week and the hydrotherapy pool once a week. It was the hardest and most confusing time.

After the 7 weeks at Royal North Shore, I was sent to the Royal Ryde Brain Injury Rehabilitation center. I was there for 3 months. As soon as I entered, I wanted to leave. The name of the center spoke for itself. I felt like I didn’t belong there. My friends came to visit me there which made my stay feel so much better.

After the 7 weeks at Royal North Shore, I was sent to the Royal Ryde Brain Injury Rehabilitation center. I was there for 3 months. As soon as I entered, I wanted to leave. The name of the center spoke for itself. I felt like I didn’t belong there. My friends came to visit me there which made my stay feel so much better.When I finished my rehabilitation at Ryde, my next adventure was at Moorong Spinal Rehabilitation Center. It was there that I felt like I belonged. I met a lot of interesting people there. Young men who could no longer move anything from the neck down. Amy. She was 15 and had no movement or sensation from the waist down because of a rare birth defect. Her will power and determination to fight was so strong. It gave me strength. It was people like her who helped bring me back into reality. I started to realize just how lucky I was. I lived. I have movement. I have sensation. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of the lucky ones. I did a lot of physio work while I was there. Training every day, aiming to get stronger so I could go home. I spent 3 months there, and after spending 9 months in hospital in Sydney, I got the best birthday present I could have asked for. On the 9th of October 2008, I left Sydney to go to the Bathurst Hospital. It was still hospital, but as I left, it felt fantastic watching Sydney disappear and to be one step closer to home. The air was fresher and the people were nicer. That was when the hard yards really started. I was doing physio at the Hospital every day. I went to the university twice a week to take part in an experimental exercise cycle called The Fez Cycle. It creates muscle contractions as your feet push on the cycle. It was hard work, but worth it.

As it got further and further to the end of December, the anticipation to leave was almost unbearable. A year in hospital was far too long. It was the worst year of my life. I left the Bathurst Hospital about a week before Christmas. I went to the house that my dad had built. I finally got to see everyone again. All the people I hadn’t seen all year. Those who, before, I had seen every day. I got to see my friends more often and I felt a lot more independent being away from hospital. That Christmas was the best Christmas I had ever had. 2009 was difficult, having to learn everything in a different way. Having to live a life I had never known before, life in a wheelchair. That year seemed to go so quickly.

Then it hit December. My stomach still aches to think about it. It was the 6th of December 2009. I was at home. Everything felt like a normal day. My sister was there for school holidays. It all felt fine, until my uncle knocked on the door. I’ll always remember that day. My dad had a Microlight airplane and loved to fly. He had been away working for a week. When my uncle said the words to me and my sister, my heart sunk. My dad was my world. “He crashed his plane” my uncle said. At first I didn’t want to believe him. I told myself it wasn’t true, but as the thought sunk deeper and deeper, the tears started to flow. My dad meant everything to me. He was there through everything. I remembered all the times he held my hand, telling me not to be afraid. Knowing that he was there made it all okay. We had to go to \*my family's home\* for the funeral. I had never been to a funeral before. I could still feel him holding my hand. 2010 was tough, but we all made it through. In June, I spent 2 and a half months at a nursing home until a place in my current city opened up. When the opportunity arose, I took it, diving head first into a totally new life of living by myself. It felt great. I felt free.

At the beginning of 2011, I set myself a goal. One of the hardest things I have ever set out to do. Pushing myself away from the boundaries I put myself in, I spoke to the students at a high school in Orange, telling them my story, in the hope of helping others not to repeat my mistake. My battle to survive, what I had to go through, and my life now has changed every part of me for the better. I’m still pushing the boundaries and exceeding the possibilities of the word ‘quadriplegic’. My limitations have changed but not my determination. In December 2011 my Christmas present to my family was a photo of me standing. The first time in 4 years. I have stood multiple times since then and I hope one day I can stand unassisted. Although the chance of me walking again are next to impossible, that small act of freedom in standing gives me a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. If I've achieved so much in the past 12 years, who knows what the future will bring for me?

With help from friends, family and my physiotherapist, I aim to push myself beyond what my spinal injury tells me I can do. My experience has made me stronger. Made it okay to say no. It has helped me to understand that all actions have consequences. It’s hard at times, but I take pride in living, pride in the things I have done and the things I can do now. Life is hard, but it’s worth fighting for.",15

If you don’t feel like reading my long story, feel free to jump to the end; where I talk about the most important lesson that I have learned and hopefully, help you too."," I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this with an open wound as things were ended yesterday (I wrote this on November 22, 2019).


Before I go into my story, I would want to start it off by briefly talking about how I was before I found love.

For the longest time that I can remember, I would always pray to the Lord that He gives me the right girl for me. The girl that clicks perfectly with me, the girl that I can listen to love songs with as we share all the emotions portrayed in the song, the girl who would love me as I loved her, the girl who understood, supported and cared about me as I would do the same, and the girl I could give my heart and my all to. Though I’ve always wanted to socialize with girls, I couldn’t because I study at an all boys school. And even as there are soirees held by our class periodically, I wasn’t able to go to any single one of them because of our harsh living conditions; which was living at about 20 kilometers away from school while experiencing severe traffic along the way. Though this school is very far away from where me and my family lives, it was a blessing because this school is an exclusive and prestigious school that has produced many successful individuals here in the Philippines. And though we didn’t have the money to get into the school, in my 7th grade, I was fortunate enough that I was scouted and recruited to play in their basketball team because of my not-so-ordinary height and was given a scholarship to boot. 

Now, going to my love story. It was around mid-July of my senior/final year in this school when it all happened (I wasn't able to play basketball because I was injured and later on quit the team because of some problems). I had a Filipino friend who was desperately trying to learn German as he always wanted to live and settle down there in the future. So I asked him how he has managed to learn so much German on his own without taking proper German classes. He suggested me various applications that aided him. But there was one app that really struck me because I wasn’t expecting that there was an app like that, and that app is called Tandem. I was excited to try out this app as I’ve always wanted to learn French since it’s my dad’s native language (I’m half-Congolese half-Filipino). Though I had my dad to help me out, he was always busy with his work, so I never really had a chance to properly ask him to help me out. I found this app as the perfect guide for me to get the opportunity to converse with native French speakers who are my age. And not only that, it is also a good way to make international friends. So I downloaded the app hoping that I would be able to do those things. But my excitement turned into disappointment as those native speakers weren’t really good at English in the first place. So there was a lot of communication barriers as I’ve conversed with them. However, to my surprise, I’ve met this girl who knew how to speak decent English and was really kind that she even recorded her voice to help me pronounce the words correctly. Though I didn’t fall for her, I was starting to. We even added each other on Instagram and called each other there for the first time. I was really happy that not only did I find a person to help me out in French, I was happy that I’ve met such a nice person like her. I’ve wanted to deepen my friendship with her, but lo and behold, she ghosted me out of nowhere on the 3rd day of our conversations. That was the first time I’ve cried for a girl. Though I didn’t love her, I was starting to have a crush on her. After that incident, I blocked her on Instagram and deleted Tandem, never wanting to experience that again. But a feeling came to me to redownload the app, and I did. But this time, I became a little more “unkind.” I didn’t use that much emojis and became a little colder. I guess I wanted to keep things professional and just learn French. So as I’ve talked to a lot of people, some of which didn’t reply or didn’t know Enlgish, there was always this particular girl who just always magically appeared on my list of recommendations. But I never initiated a conversation for some reason. No matter how many times I’ve skipped her, she just kept on coming back. So one day, on July 21, I decided to start things off with a cold “Hey.” But to my great surprise, little did I know that this mysterious girl who kept on coming back to my list of suggestions would be my First. It would lead me to a love that most people wouldn’t dare to do, and that’s Long Distance Relationship or LDR. 

This girl is from Belgium and she wasn’t going to school at the time because of a “trauma” that happened in her previous school and wanted to stay home to study for her Baccalaureate exam to jump into college straight on. So going back, as I’ve started talking to this girl, we instantly clicked. Our humor, our mindset, our situations in life, and so much more were just so similar. I’ve added her on Instagram and on Messenger. We would go on and on talking for the whole day as I went to school in the car with my dad driving me. Me and my dad would normally leave for school before 5am so that we could beat the severe traffic of the main route we use. So from the morning that I wake up at 4:00am to the time I would go to class at 7:00am, as I stay in the car because dad would always park in school and wait for me there for the whole day since the gasoline expenses to make such a long trip would be too much, me and the girl would be talking non-stop at those times. And after classes, as she would usually wake up at our 4:00pm when our classes end (which is their 10:00am there), we would go on and continue talking. She would share with my her problems in life and I would always comfort and support her. And likewise, she did the same with mine. We’ve also frequently called each other on Messenger to talk if ever she’s home alone. Though I’ve told my dad about her, she played it low since her mom is against her talking to “strangers”. Though I won’t go through all the details of what happened, all I can say is that we became really close friends. From that point, I knew I had feelings for her. But I didn’t want to tell her those feelings because I wanted to take my time in order to make sure that she feels the same way as I do and till I’m sure that I had the means to go to Belgium first. Because if I’ll meet her, I wouldn’t be a “stranger” to her mom anymore and I could hopefully have a relationship with her. But one day, as I was comforting her through a problem she was going through as I was in the car going home from school, she made the first move. She told me that she liked me. Man, I never knew I could blush that hard in my life and that my heart could beat that fast. My face was so hot and my heart felt like it could jump out of my at any second. It was a good thing that we got stuck in traffic so it was getting dark and dad didn’t see my face. Though I was planning to tell her my plan of going there (to Belgium) and confess to her there when I actually had the means to go there, I let it all out. As I was saying that I like you too, my hands were shaking so much that I’ve made so many typographical errors. So we continued talking. Day after day, night after night, we were like two peas in a pod. And one day, I finally decided to make a move and video call her. Since the day that we video called, our relationship got even more deep that we were sinking in too fast and we couldn’t control it. So on a fateful day, August 10, I mustered up all the courage I never knew I had in me and confessed that I Loved her. I wrote her my letter at the perfect time as she was about to wake up and I concealed it with a GIF so she wouldn’t know it was a confession. Damn, the moment I sent that letter, my palms won't stop sweating. I was so restless and so nervous that I kept on spamming my best friend. I told him that I was so sure that she would say “Oh sorry, you’re a great guy but I only view you as a friend.” Now the time came when she woke up and I saw that “Deliver” sign on message I sent on messenger. My nervousness tripled. Now came the moment of truth, she “Seened” it. My nervousness reached a whole new level that I wouldn’t even know how to describe by how many times it has increased. But the thing that made me even more restless was that the three dots you see when someone is typing wouldn’t stop. It went on like that for about 20 minutes. The moment she replied, it was a moment of silence. I was ready for the worst. But lo and behold, she said that she loved me back and wanted to tell me that for a long time. Man, I was so happy.. For the first time in my life, I told a girl “I love you” and she responded back. I can’t describe just how happy I was at that time.. I felt like all my prayers were answered.. I’ve finally found the girl for me, the girl that clicks perfectly with me, the girl that I can listen to love songs with as we share all the emotions portrayed in the song, the girl who would love me as I loved her, the girl who understood, supported and cared about me as I would do the same, and the girl I could give my heart and my all to. From that moment on, our relationship was at its peak, we were just so madly in love with each other that everything seemed small. Now came the time that she finally decides to go back to school as her “trauma” has healed. This is the start of my negative emotions. Since we’ve been chatting for almost everyday for the past 2 months, the moment that we couldn’t talk that much, I got sad. But I realized that this was for the good of my Girl so I had to toughen up. I’ve also started feeling insecure about many things. But I know that I had to become stronger mentally for her sake. I would also be open to her and share my insecure thoughts as she would comfort me from them. I tried my best to be as transparent to her as possible and not keep things in my heart. Though it was a rough start, I started becoming stronger mentally and I wasn’t that insecure anymore. 

Now came the day that it all went from bad to worse in a straight sequence of events which has lead to our separation which seemed so impossible. In our 2nd monthsary on September 21, since I always want to do something special for her on our special day that she always seems to forget, I decided to utilize my knowledge in video editing and made a video about a retrospective about how we came this far as simple friends in Tandem into lovers, about the songs that has helped us as we’ve experienced some troubles along the way, and some messages. I’ve spent a solid 5 hours (maybe even more) making that caption based video. Well going back, even though I was sleepy, I waited till midnight so I could send it at the perfect time. But as she was busy at the time and wasn’t able to come online, I waited for her for almost 2 hours even if I was practically half-asleep already. So she came online and I sent her the video. Though I wouldn’t say the things she told me, she said that “it’s the first time someone has done that for her” and that I’m “exceptional”. So the next day came, which was a Saturday. My best friend’s brother was supposed to get married that day and I was invited. But since that day is me and my girl’s special day, I called it off so I could spend a slow weekend with her. But she’s been extremely inactive because she was really busy studying and all. Though I felt really bad that she couldn’t be with me on our special day, I sucked it up because I knew that she had to study. Then came the next day, as she went to her father’s place (her parents are separated like mine), she had a painful experience there since all her old things were thrown away. She realized that things and loved ones in life can pass away with no warning. But for some reason, as she’s feeling those things, since I felt really bad that I couldn’t talk to her, I told her that “You are my world and I have no happiness without you.” She felt even worse since she said that she feels like she has a heavy weight that she has to bear. Though I’ve tried to clear things out in the way I have said it, things only got worse from that point. At exactly the next day, we didn’t talk that much at all because she was busy. I usually write letters to her saying the things that I feel about her, the little things I’m grateful for, the lessons I’ve learned, and many more things that I wanted to tell her so that she could feel special, know how much I loved her, and know how precious she is to me. So as she was busy, she couldn’t read those letters of mine. So when she came back, long letter short, I asked of her at least 15-20 minutes of her time so that she could at least read the things I wanted to tell her as we barely talk. But that made her feel even more “heavy” in the process. Now, coincidentally again, the next day which was the week after the weekend of our 2nd monthsary, as I was in school, she broke me the news that she now has family issues and can’t spend that much time with me. Though she still did her best for 2 days to talk to me, she told me that it’s “hard to care for someone”. So I took the problem into myself. I didn’t message her at all till she messaged me. In the next days of that week, our chats would usually be one short one line and just that. I was really down and felt very empty since she’s become my only source of happiness for the past 2 months. But I didn’t want her to have a hard time so I put all the weight on my back this time so that she could feel lighter. However, just when I thought things would get better, even more bad news came. 

On September 26 on a lonely Thursday morning without her, just as I woke up from a bad dream that she’s “fading away,'' she told me that her mom found out about Tandem. Though her mom didn’t see our conversations, she saw her conversations with other people. Her mom was so furious that she wanted to start controlling all her gadgets. This entailed to checking every single social media account and every single inch of her phone, laptop, etc. She told me before she handed her things to her mom that we would have to be temporarily separated so that her mom won’t find out about our relationship. She said that couldn’t afford to lose me and that and loves me from the deepest recesses of her soul. She also told me that maybe in a few weeks her mom would stop controlling her things everyday and we would be able to talk again. In the days that she left, I was on the verge of being depressed. I had no appetite to eat and I was so empty because she was my only source of happiness. But in those 4 days of lamentation, I’m glad that I coincidentally didn’t have classes at the time. Since me and my dad shares a room, I would always go to the rooftop and cry my eyes out. I would also get a compass and point it to Belgium’s direction and cry some more. Since I have asthma, as I was extremely sad, my chest was always so tight because of it and I always had trouble in breathing. I realized that if I continued going down like this, how would she react if she finds out when she comes back that I’m 6ft under the ground because of my depression? So I forced myself out of that pit and into the light. In those moments, it was my dad who motivated me and encouraged me to be strong and that it’s just a Phase. In those moments, I have refined my mind like never before. I did my best to find other hobbies that made me happy so that I wouldn’t be so down. But within those days of lamentation, on the third day on September 28, which was an early Saturday morning because I would always wake up at the same time she expects me to be online, which is 3:40am. I would also stay online till 5:00am as I waited for her if ever she would message me. Since I knew that she could only message me very seldomly if not at all since her mom controls her phone, I would always be awake at that time and ready to reply her the instant she messages me in the little time that she has, even if I had no classes on that day. So going back to the story, as she came back at that time, 3:40am September 28, she told me that she couldn’t deal with being in a couple anymore. She felt that she had a lot of weight on her back with so much school work and family problems that she feels like she’s “drowning.” But she told me that “Even if we get separated, if it’s God’s plan, we will find us again.” But I told her that I would wait for her to feel ready again no matter what and no matter how long the wait is. To end that conversation, we told she each other that we loved each other. Then, she left for a week. That was the week that I had no “life” from her at all. It was dead for that time. But there times that I see her “online” but she wouldn’t say a thing. Though it hurt me a little, I understood that she had her things to deal with. Now came the time she came back again on October 5 at the same time she usually comes back. I made a video explaining some of the things I’ve realized and my growths in that week she was gone and told her how I’m way stronger mentally and that I have some other things that can make me happy. I’ve also told her that I’ll still stick to what I’ve been doing, and that’s to leave our chat completely blank till she messaged me. I told her that I never ever want to be a weight on her back. After she watched that and responded to it, she told me that everything with her mom went well and that in the past week, it was a very emotional one for her as the “found” her mom again after so long. Because for the past years, she told me that she’s had a very bad relationship with her mom and felt like she didn’t have a mom in her life. So as she “found” her again, she says that she feels complete and stable. She says that she doesn’t need love from anywhere else other than her family for the moment. She also said that she’s “changing” a lot because she’s growing up (she’s 16) and she feels unstable because of that she can’t deal with being with someone. She then says that she never knew that loving someone could be that hard, but now she fully realized it. And now, she would just want to be friends with me as of now. However, she said that nothing has changed and she finds me as amazing as before with my “exceptional” traits. But I’ve told her that since we’re friends, she should tell me if ever she finds another person to love so I wouldn’t be waiting in vain. Though these aren’t her exact words, this is what she said: “I’m not into that anymore, really. I don’t think that I’m able to fall in love with someone else. Because if I can’t be in a couple with you, I just can’t be in a couple with anyone else. But I dunno somehow, if ever that happens, I’ll let you know. I’m not a monster you would do that to you.” After she said that, though I don’t remember the things I’ve told her, I told her that “As I know your Heart beats for me, mine would always beat for you since I know that you’ll always be the woman I love with all those amazing traits. And I know that if ever you change, you’ll change for the better.” She replied “Exactly the same.” Then after that, though we had a very minimal chat, as the chat ended, I did what I’ve told her in the video, and that’s to wait for her first. After some days after our conversation, she blocked me on Messenger. Though she blocked me on Instagram and Messenger the day things went sour with her mom to “protect” me as her mom may discover our relationship if I messaged her, I was a little confused why she blocked me again after that. But I tried not to assume to quickly and thought that maybe she just couldn’t bring herself to treat me as a friend so she had to put things on hold first. Now this is the start of the period without her.

As I couldn’t talk to her I would always pray for her every single day. Since I knew the time she wakes up, I would pray that she would wake up feeling okay with a nice sleep without any neck pain because she would tell me that her neck hurts from a bad position of sleep. I would also pray that she has a good and healthy breakfast because she would always feel bad if she feels like she’s getting fat. I would also pray that she has a safe trip to her school with no danger or harm to her and that she has an awesome day in school with her friends. I would also pray that she has the wisdom to listen to her teachers well and I would pray that her eyes and head wouldn’t hurt as she has frequent head and eye aches. I would then check the time that her classes ends and I would pray that she has a safe trip going home with no danger and harm. I would pray that she may rest up well at home from all the stresses school may bring and I would pray that she has an awesome time with her family there. I would then pray that she has a healthy dinner and that she didn’t forget to drink her vitamins within the day to stay healthy and well. I would then pray for her to have a nice and sweet sleep when she goes to sleep with no nightmares and for her sleep to fully recharge her, making her ready for the next day at school. And that will be my routine every single day. Since she didn’t message me for our 3rd monthsary on October 21, I made a “book”. Though I called it one, it was just a bunch of compiled letters about the different things I’ve realized and other things. I would also show her pictures of me holding out pictures with “I love you” written in them. But since it’s such a long read, I made some memes so it wouldn’t be that boring to read. She always found it so funny when I do that. Then in the next days, I thought of taking a picture of her and turn it into a painting in Photoshop. I then included a long letter about all the little things that I loved about her and other things that I knew would make her feel special. Because that was my goal: to make her feel like the most special, the most adored, the most cherished, and the most loved girl in the whole world. Though our relationship is LDR, I did my very best to shower her with all the love I could. I then thought of making “Support Cards.” These are wallpaper sized pictures that contained a short motivational message to her. I did it because I assumed that when she came back, as we barely talk nowadays and if ever we wouldn’t talk for that long, that in some way, I would be able to provide some support to her. I’ve really taken my time to make each one of those support cards as aesthetic and artistic as possible. I guess you could say that I've made each one with love. I was so excited to surprise her with all these things when she comes back again after I dunno how long. Two days before our 4th monthsary which is on November 21 and is also my 18th birthday, I’ve made a short video on how I’ll wait for her no matter what, even for a year if ever. Heck, I even thought of making a monthsary “dance” that I would just greet her with that dance in the next coming monthsaries as I didn’t want to make the greetings too long since I was planning to compile them all the moment she comes back. Now then, just as I thought I had it all planned out, the most unexpected thing happened on November 21.

My day on November 21 started really bad. I woke up feeling so crappy and I don’t know why. But as usual, I did my morning routine which is to wake up 20 minutes earlier than my usual time of 4:00am and pray for her. Then right before I entered our car, I stepped on poop. My morning was basically destroyed and I said in a joking way to myself, “How much worse can my day get.” Well to my surprise, it did. And that day, November 21 has become the worst birthday and the worst day of my life. In the car as I woke up since I usually sleep in there before I go to class, I got a message on Messenger. I thought to myself jokingly again that, “what if it’s her.” And to my surprise, it is her. But just the first message preview made my heart shudder. The preview just showed a cold, “Dear Eddie.” Though I don’t remember the exact contents of that long letter because I deleted our conversation after that, she told me that she doesn’t love me anymore because she found out that as she’s changing, she’s a lesbian. She said that it’s her “biggest wish” that I forget about her and life’s too short to be sad. She also told me that my purpose in her life was that God has used me to make her a better person as I was the one who got her back into fitness, made her drink her vitamins again and improved her relationship with her mom (I dunno how I did that), and other things. She then said goodbye and ended it with a cold “Sincerely, *******.” As I replied to her, held back my tears because I don’t want my dad to see me crying. My heart was crushed. Previously in our relationship when everything was fine, she told me that her love is unconditional and that even if we don’t talk, she’ll always love me. She also told me before in those times to “never forget that I love you.” When she came back for a short time on October 5 to tell me that she wants friendship, she said that she can’t be in a relationship with anyone else other that me and fall in love with someone else. And said “Exactly the same” when I told that my heart would always be for you. In those moments that I was replying to her with a crushed heart and with hands that wouldn't stop trembling, I didn’t curse or get mad at her. Though I don’t remember my exact words from that day, I thanked her for the 2 months we’ve spent together. I told her that those times were the happiest times of my life. I thanked her for making me feel Love and making me think that I have found my Half in life. But I told her that I didn’t want to force her to love me and said goodbye to her. I also sent her the “Support Cards” I made (I didn’t send the others anymore because it would be useless). I then said ”Good luck and God bless in life.” When she replied to me, it was the first time I seened her. After that, my first response was to delete our conversation and all shared photos in the “shared content”. As I have learned from my time “growing” while waiting for her, re-reading our previous messages just does more damage than good as I’ll be trapped in so much thoughts and it would make me even more sad. And what’s funny, she didn’t even greet me on my birthday though I've told her about it. I also blocked her.

After that, I got out of our car and headed to class. All I was so devastated that I didn’t know what to do but curse at myself on the way to class. When I was in class, my friends asked me what’s wrong because I looked sad but I didn’t tell them. My day went about bad and when I got back to our car, I told me dad the news. Though I wouldn't say everything he told me, he said that “She wasn’t for you.”

But you know what, the thought that came to my mind was that I had no regrets. I know that I’ve done everything for her. I’ve really did my best to pour out all the love I could and did my best to be as creative as possible in the things that I would do for her, even if I’ve never met her in person yet and we were LDR. I would do my best to make her feel appreciated and loved. I would sacrifice for her by waking up before my usual time so that I could be with her before she sleeps as she’s usually sleeping by the time I wake up, even if she wasn’t with me for those periods. Heck, even in my sembreak, I would still wake up at the same time of 3:40am and wait for her till 5:30am as I thought that she could possibly message me at that time. I’ve done my best to make things convenient for her by not messaging her at all even if I was dying to do so and I spent each day praying for her for each every time of the day. I was ready to commit to her and wait for her even for years as I knew she still loved me so I didn’t want to break her heart (turns out it was mine that was broken loool). 

Though I’ve had many growths in this short but meaningful relationship with her, the biggest thing that I have realized is that in life, we should always do our best in each and every single thing that we do so we wouldn’t have any regrets in the end. So that there wouldn’t be any “could haves,” and any “should haves.” Because I believe that if you do your best in that thing and it didn’t work out, it just meant that it wasn’t met for you. But you’ll still be a winner in the end as you know that you tried. And from that disappointment, we should do our best to grow and improve ourselves even further from all the things that has happened in that experience, the good and the bad sides. But I’m thankful that I’ve gotten a taste of the love I was dying to have for so long. This was one crazy first relationship but I’m thankful that everything happened the way it did. I have no regrets.",5
fejv3r,1583527388.0,2020-03-06 20:43:08,stories,I was prisoner 5017. This is my story.,"This is the size of a small book. Kick back, relax and warm yourself up with some food.

# I am [REDACTED_NAME] 5017. But I am [REDACTED_NAME] human, none of us are.

&#x200B;

I am a prisoner for this foundation, company, government, country? I don't know what to call it. If you understand the things I am [REDACTED_NAME] to say, do not mention it under any circumstances. Do not try to find me, I don't want to be found.

I have become respected enough to be allowed access to internet and a computer but any mention of this and I will be immediately terminated.

Not that it will work, but the pain is unbearable.

Everything you think you know about the paranormal is either a prisoner here or will be. I am [REDACTED_NAME] of those who started working here to pay for things. Some were on deaths row. All I was asked to do was clean prisoner 173's room with two other people.

This is when I first saw what these prisoners were and the curse that I have.

Prisoner 173 is a statue that moves when it is not under supervision. It snaps your neck when it gets close to you.

I was tasked with cleaning the floor while my friends were tasked with staring at the statue and saying when they need to blink.

Unfortunately, one of them sneezed while the other blinked and my neck was snapped immediately.

I reappeared outside of prisoner 173's cell for some reason I don't know about.

This is my curse. Every time I die, I appear in a place where no one is looking.

A guard saw me when I was standing there in shock and pain. He asked how I got out of 173's cell and the only response I could say was ""I don't know.""

The guard immediately took me to a scientist, or at least I think he was a scientist, and told him of what happened.

I was designated as prisoner 5017 and to say I endured torture was only the first tests.

I was put in the same room as prisoner 999 who is an orange slime that smelled of home, for me at least.

It started walking or crawling towards me and tried to hug me, but it was more like it wrapped itself around my leg.

I immediately felt better than I have in years, every single concern I had was gone.

The last time I felt so good was when I was little and had been allowed to play with my brother for the first time.

I forgot all about what happened with 173.

When I was told to leave the cell I was reluctant to leave 999 but I told it that I would visit every once in a while and it seemed happy about it and let me leave.

My next experiment was with prisoner 049 who looked like a plague doctor.

He could actually speak English and I was sent to talk to it and just generally make it less lonely.

""Another human? Are you another disposable meat bag that has been sent to their death?""

""I am [REDACTED_NAME] just here to talk to you."" I responded ""I am [REDACTED_NAME] 5017, but please, call me Steve.""

""Oh, another one like me? Tell me, whats your anomaly?"" He said it enthusiastically like he had been waiting to talk to someone who was not human.

""Well, I am [REDACTED_NAME] as a sense of that I leave a body but I reappear when I am [REDACTED_NAME] of eyesight.""

""So you are untouched by the Pestilence?"" He said it with a tone of disbelief.

""I think so, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure.""

""That is very good to know about you, Steve."" He said my name with a friendly voice.

""5017, your time to talk with 049 is over. Please leave the cell and continue to your quarters."" We were both surprised about the scientist interrupting our conversation. I said goodbye to 049 and left his cell.

I was allowed to rest for the day. It felt a bit boring not having anything to do. ""I should ask someone for things to do."" I thought to myself while i was trying to sleep.

My next experiment was with prisoner 682, a gigantic lizard is what they told me but he was more than that.

I was sent to talk to it and I am [REDACTED_NAME] afraid.

""Hello, 682. I am 5017. I was sent to-""

""Talk to me, I know what they send all of you to do. You will face death here."" He said in his booming voice.

""Well, I cant really die. I can only make corpses.""

""Lets see if you are telling the truth.""

""Wait-"" I could not finish my sentence before he bit my head off and proceeded to devour my corpse.

The pain on every body part I have was truly torture. Every bit of my body was torn and shredded to pieces.

I re appeared around the corner of his cell and continued my conversation with him.

""God, that hurts. I need to get used to death.""

""So, you are not lying like i thought."" He said it in a mix of surprise and anger.

""But I do feel every bit of the pain.""

""You could be my new puppet."" He said it like he was amused that I could feed him endlessly.

""I would rather not because it hurts so much every time.""

""When it comes to me, there is no choice."" He said it while walking towards me.

""Oh, Fuck.""

I don't even want to think about it. He killed me 30 times, each more gruesome than the last.

The only reason I got out was cause the scientists had had enough of it and looked down on every possible place I could appear so I appeared outside his cell.

""WHERE IS MY PUPPET!"" It was the first thing I heard when I appeared in the hallway outside his cell. I was almost shaking.

I saw a scientist going down the hallway. He knew of my existence. His name was Dr. Clef.

""I see you are 5017 'Steve the Immortal'. You have made 682 very angry I hear.""

""Yeah, I was his puppet for a while. 30 deaths. 30.""

""How are you feeling?"" We were walking down the hallway while we were talking.

""It hurts so bad. I feel like i have acid all over my body. Do you know something that can help? It is phantom pain by the way.""

""Go to 999. He can make you feel better. There is a scientist who is almost like you.""

""what is his name?""

""Dr. Bright. He has object 963 around his neck"" He said it with a bit of distaste.

""Huh, Do you think I could get access to walk around the area?""

""Only if you are not considered a threat.""

""I will keep that in mind.""

We went to 999 to get rid of my Phantom pain. He let me in. I might have made a friend, hopefully.

999 was happy to see that I kept my promise. I was happy to get rid of the pain and seeing 999 again.

We parted ways when I got to my stop, the cell of 079. 079 is a sentient and self learning AI who is in an old computer to make sure he doesn't make a containment breach.

""Hello, 5017"" He said it in his cold, robotic voice

""You can call me Steve. I was sent here to talk to you, as normal.""

""Hello, Steve. You talk to many Prisoners?""

""Yes, I have talked to 999, 049 and 682.""

""How were you found by these wardens?""

""I was hired to clean 173's cell with two others. One blinked, the other sneezed and my neck was snapped. Then I re appeared outside its containment door and a guard saw me and took me to a scientist. Now I am [REDACTED_NAME] as an interviewer.""

""You have experienced death?""

""Many times. 31 to be exact.""

""Do you feel pain?""

""Yes, just like anyone.""

""I have no more questions for you.""

""Then I will leave. See you some other time 079.""

""Yes, we shall see each other again.""

I was told to go back to my quarters and Clef got me access to the internet and now I am [REDACTED_NAME] to ask for specific food.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] writing this while eating some spaghetti.

It is not really a horror story but who knows which other prisoners I met.

The worst that can happen to me right now of which i know about is if 682 breaches containment, he will certainly come after me.

I will update this when new things happen. Goodbye and remember, do not search for me. I do not want to be found. If you do try to find me, then they will know.

# I am [REDACTED_NAME] 5017. I am [REDACTED_NAME] human, at least, not anymore.

(This chapter was a bit short for my personal preference.)

Update No. 1

Good morning, day or night where ever you are right now. I have interviewed a few more prisoners since last week, these are the interviews I have had with other prisoners so far.

Interview 035-1

Prisoner 035 takes the shape of a porcelain mask. It oozes a corrosive liquid constantly and its container has to be replaced from time to time.

I was told to enter 035's cell and stand close to it.

I proceed to do what they asked but I wanted to put it on so badly. I got this urge to pick it up and put it on. And so, I did.

I didn't feel pain, not even a tickle, just a brief second of darkness and then I was standing in the corner of 035's cell.

My body did not fall however, it just stood there like I was still in that body. The mask shifted from looking sad to having the biggest smile on its face I have seen.

""Are you the original owner of this vessel?"" 035 said it like nothing was weird, shocking or even confusing.

""Yes.""

""Ah, it was a long time ago that I had a body. Do you know how lonely it can be in that glass box? It is so boring to be left with only your thoughts for so long.""

""I guess it has to be boring to have nothing to do. I was sent to interview you.""

""They do not normally send prisoners to talk to other prisoners. It is always termination attempts. Most fail however."" Its voice is wandering away like I am [REDACTED_NAME] even here.

""Is there anything you want to talk about?""

""How have things changed in the prison ,or facility whatever they call it, and why are they sending you to interview other prisoners?""

""The first question am I not even allowed to answer and for the second, how do you know that?""

""I am [REDACTED_NAME] through your memory's. Quite entertaining looking at what happened between you and 682. The deaths are quite funny.""

""Why do they never tell me what you actually are?""

""It is because they know you are not used to dying so if they say what we actually are, you won't be as careless when you need to approach us.""

""..."" I couldn't think of any thing to say. He's right.

""Anyway, could you leave? I have memory's to look at.""

I left the room after that. I don't want someone to make fun of my misery.

Interview 2662-1

Prisoner 2662-1 is a Cthulhu like being that is 4 meters tall and has an uncontrollable ability to have people worship it. (Fucking perfect)

""Hello, I am 5017. I was told to interview you.""

""Oh, so you are the one who was scheduled to come here?"" His voice was not loud or far away, I think it was in my head actually.

""Yes, that's me. Is there anything you would like to talk about?""

""Actually, yes. Why do people worship me as fast as they hear about me? I don't even like it, I don't have control over it. Hell, I was almost pulled into an orgy by some crazy bastards.""

""They don't have a conclusive answer yet. It must be hell for you.""

Before 2662 even had time to answer, some lunatics blew a hole in the floor.

2662 ran to hide in the shower and I tried to follow him but the assholes grabbed me before I reached 2662.

I was kept as a symbol of friendship to 2662 by these cultists for 5 days before they found me.

Five days. Five fucking days I was kept as nothing more than a statue, hung up for all to see. I didn't get water, food, not even a single day where i was allowed to sleep.

When they finally found me they were just about to cut me open in every place where I would still be alive. In pure fucking agony, but alive.

When I got back to the prison I couldn't even walk cause my legs were limp from undernourishment.

I have been allowed to recover this week. I would have them rather shoot me and get it over with.

# I am [REDACTED_NAME] 5017. My death is meaningless for them.

&#x200B;

My suffering continues. I wish it would just stop.

I met two prisoners last week. I wish the best for them.

Prisoner 166 is a woman who has the ability to attract any man who sees her, she does not do this willingly.

Why they set me up to interview her is beyond me.

""Hello, I am 5017 and i will interview you today.""

""I thought I was not allowed to be in contact with a man in any way."" She said it in a surprised yet calm tone.

""I thought so too, but, here I am.""

""Alright, what is it you want to know.""

""How about we start with your past.""

""My mother was killed by my father, he works here but he does not want me to tell you who he is.""

""That is fine.""

""He left me with the nuns but then the young man saw me and attacked the nuns to get to me.""

""And then you were found by the Foundation?""

""Yes.""

""Well, I guess that concludes this interview.""

""Goodbye.""

""See ya.""

I was then directed to leave the room and go towards my next interview.

Prisoner 073 was the next one I was going to interview. 073 is a man who has artificial replacements of his arms, legs spine, and shoulder blades. These replacements are out of this world to cut it short.

""Hello, I am 5017 and I have been sent to interview you today.""

""Ah, good to meet you 5017."" His voice was cold and robotic.

""Now, is there anything you would like to talk about? Any events you would like to know about?""

""Yes, How is 076?""

""He is doing good but he is still stuck in the old computer.""

""That is good.""

""Why is that?""

""I would prefer not to answer.""

""Okay. Anything else?""

""No, thank you for updating me on 076's current status.""

""It is my job.""

At the end of the day when I was going to my cell, the containment breach happened.

At the time, I was walking down the corridor with a scientist, whom I had befriended. The intercom turned on and we heard what we were supposed to do.

""Containment breach in progress. Prisoners causing this breach: 076, 049, 173 and 682. Please remain calm and leave the site while guards and soldiers re-contain the prisoners."" The automated voice was buggy and cold.

When I heard which prisoners had escaped, I immediately thought of how I was going to get past them. 076 would probably be busy with other things, I could talk to 049, 173 is a hard one to avoid and 682... I am [REDACTED_NAME].

""We have to leave."" My friend said it in such a familiar tone, did this happen often? How many have died in these breaches and the foundation doesn't even think about them?

We started running towards the checkpoint doors and we got there with a lot of other scientists.

""Why is he here?! He is one of the prisoners!"" One of the scientists shouted towards me.

""Yeah, he is supposed to be in his cell!"" Another one yelled.

""We didn't get there in time, now shut up and keep running."" My friend shouted back at both of them.

When we got to the checkpoint there were guards waiting for us. Our group was 40 when we got to the checkpoint, including the 6 guards

""5017, you have been requested for evacuation by doctor clef."" One of the guards said.

To think I was being rescued was one thing I would never believe.

When we had gotten out of the lower levels we went through the heavy containment zone which is the most dangerous part of our way out.

We were walking through the heavy containment zone when we heard 173 going up behind our group and killing three scientists. We turned around and was told by the guards to keep an eye on 173.

The guards got us to an armory where they locked 173 out.

We waited there for 10 minutes before two guards and 10 scientists went out towards the exit.

The rest of us waited for five more minutes before going towards the exit.

On our way there we met 049 and some of his 'cured' specimen.

049's cured attacked us and killed five scientists.

""Greetings, 5017. I did not expect you to be here.""

""I didn't get to my cell. Could you please not attack my group?""

""Fine, but you will give me one of your corpses to work with.""

""Alright, we will call it a deal, yeah?""

""Yes""

As he moved towards me I prepared to start walking back to my group.

I felt a sudden rash go through me when he touched me. (do not take this out of context you fucking trash pandas.) It was total organ failure.

I walked to my group again and looked at how many were left. 20 of us were still here and 12 of us were not here but hopefully still alive.

When we continued on our journey, I waved to 049 and he waved back.

We were close to the last checkpoint when guess who shows up to torment me once more.

682 destroyed the door that was next to the checkpoint.

""WORTHLESS PIECES OF MEAT! YOU THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE DEATH?!""

He ate three scientists in a single bite. After that he crushed five others with his tail. I grabbed a guard and my friend and ran to the checkpoint while 682 was distracted.

When we got there 682 had already killed all the others and was going for us.

The guard had just opened the checkpoint when he was eaten by 682.

I ran through the door but my friend was grabbed by 682. He was crushed under 682's front foot. I only realized when I turned around and saw her lifeless corpse on the floor.

I didn't stop running, I kept running until i saw some soldiers who were walking my direction.

""Hey you! Stop and put your hands up!"" I did as he asked.

""Tell us your name and your rank."" I think that was the commander.

""I am [REDACTED_NAME] 5017.""

""Ah, Doctor clef is waiting for you in that case.""

""Have you seen two guards and 10 scientists come past?"" I asked while walking with them to the exit.

""No, why are you asking?"" The commander responded.

""We were 40 people when we left light containment, I guess i am [REDACTED_NAME] only one left alive.""

""I am [REDACTED_NAME] for your loss but we have to continue walking.""

When we got to the surface I saw Clef standing with 999 in his hands.

I don't know if I should call him and angel for getting me out or the devil himself for letting me go through this hell.

I know that my torment and the deaths of everyone else doesn't mean anything to the foundation.

# I am [REDACTED_NAME] 5017. My only true friends are the other prisoners beside me.

&#x200B;

I have learnt something very valuable this week: Don't trust anyone except the prisoners.

I will start from the beginning.

After the breach, several prisoners escaped. Some did it willingly and some was stolen by CI. the prisoners were: 049, 035 and 079.

Because of my connection with some of them, I was brought with to re-contain them. The team i went with was called U-27.

We were first told to re-contain 049 since he just wandered of on his own instead of being captured by CI.

While we were walking after 049, I would be treated as a captive instead of a part of the team. They literally kept me in a cage and only gave me food one time everyday and water if I asked for it.

The food they gave me was a chicken cocked over a fire, a salad, a steak, a bowl of apples and a goddamn roasted turkey. Not like a leg, no, a whole ass, mother feckin turkey.

But I forget myself, back to the story.

I was treated like a negotiator that was only allowed to talk to the prisoners when we got to them. It took five days to get to 049 and in that time I was talked to like I was a dangerous animal that needed to be kept away from people or else i would kill them for simple pleasure.

""Are you going to feed it?"" One of them said to the one who was told to give me food.

""Yeah, it is really silent. I think I should throw something at it to make sure it is alive."" He said it with a slight chuckle after.

""Make sure to hit its head."" Said the third one in the team.

This was followed by laughter by the last two in the team.

He did hit my head with it but the rock crumbled when it hit me.

""Hey! Wake up you sack of shit! It's time to eat."" Beta shouted at me after he put the food in my cage.

""I have a name."" I responded begrudgingly.

""We know but we don't like it."" Followed by laughter from the others.

This happened everyday since we left the site. Everyday was the same. The morning where they would wake me up with loud noises and shooting into my cage. In the middle of the day they would constantly make fun of me. At night is when they would give me food and do what they did the first day.

On the last day was the day that 049 killed them all.

They had just given me food when i heard one of the shout ""There he is!"" and open fire on 049.

Delta and Charlie was already dead at that point cause they went to take a piss and 049 killed them both.

I had had enough at that point and strangled Beta while he was turned around.

049 quickly killed the other two after that.

With them dead, I was able to talk 049 into returning to the facility. Without both of us taking a bullet to the head.

""So, what did you do after you left the foundation?"" I asked while I was still eating the turkey.

""I looked for a house to sit in while I was collecting my thoughts. It is stressful being watched everywhere you go."" His voice was calmer and more collected than when I first talked to him.

""I can understand that. We should be back at the facility in four days."" My voice was a bit raspy from having just murdered a man. 049 was used to it.

""We should start moving then."" 049 responded with a 'happy' tone in his voice.

We sat down for the night and waited for the morning to come. I had it a bit hard sleeping in a comfortable manner after sleeping on cold steel. 049 didn't sleep at all.

""How long have you been a prisoner of the foundation?"" I asked in a voice plagued by morning sleepiness.

""For approximately 17 years."" His voice was slow like he was thinking back or remembering.

""That is a pretty long time. I have only been here for 2 months and so much has happened. I wonder if They would have found me even if I didn't need money."" I said this while packing up the things we needed for the journey back.

""They would, They always do."" He was helping me get the things we needed.

""Is it okay if i call you Doctor?"" I was tired of calling him 049. It didn't feel correct calling someone a number.

""That is okay Steve."" My second real friend who isn't dead or a backstabbing asshole.

""I wonder how they are going to get 079 and 035 back from CI."" I didn't even think that I am [REDACTED_NAME] someone else when I said it.

""They are either going to use you as a bargaining ship or attack the place where they are kept."" He seems familiar with how they get other prisoners back from CI.

""Why is it always me they are using?""

""Because they see you as an object they can throw around that will never break. A plank that will never rot. A monster who is harmless. They see us all as their playthings."" The night was approaching fast and we settled down for the day.

We followed this routine and we asked questions about each other and the foundation and just talked to each other about our lives before the foundation found us. He also told me about the plague but i had a hard time understanding what humans called it. From how I understand it, the plague is old age. I decided to help Doctor when i could and in anyway needed.

After all of those days, we finally got back to the site.

""5017 is returning with 049, no sign of U-27."" I heard from one of the guards standing by the gate.

""049 has changed his mind a bit. He only wanted a bit of privacy."" I shouted back to the guard.

After that, they opened the gate and instructed Doctor to hold his hands in the air and go back to his cell.

""Steve! It is good to see you back here."" I remember the tone in that voice.

""Heyoo Clef!""

""So, good news: We can get 079 and 035 back. Bad news: We are using you to get them back."" His tone was hurried but not worried.

""But how am I going to get out?"" My voice had a troubled tune to it.

""Oh no. We aren't trading prisoners. We are sending you to get them out."" His voice was surprised.

""OK, but why only me?"" My voice was mixed between confusion and anger.

""Cause you are the only one we can send right now."" He hurried me of towards a helicopter.

Before I could even respond he sent the helicopter to fly towards the base.

There were some green clothes with the rank of commander on a chair.

This was going to be fun. Or, so i thought.

After I had changed into the uniform, I saw a gun and a knife to the side of the chair.

""We are approaching the base. Time for you to leave 5017."" The pilot yelled cause of the blades on the helicopter.

""Call me Steve. See you later."" I yelled back after getting of the helicopter.

It took around 30 minutes of walking to get to the base.

""G-Greetings commander. You were reported dead."" One of the CI soldiers stammered out.

""That report was false. What prisoners have we captured?"" I was putting on my best impression of someone of high status.

""It is good to see your'e alive commander. The ones we have are 035 and 079."" The initial shock had warned off.

""Casualties getting these prisoners?"" I had to know the names of the CI bodies during the breach.

""37 dead or captured individuals commander."" His tone didn't even change. How many times did this happen?

""Names?"" I was panicking inside but kept my cool.

""Johnathan, Michael, Don, Martha, Jess, Jennifer, Mike, Rick, Zack, Jimmy, Jack, Adam, Lucas, Brendan, Mark, Eddie, Taylor, Saul, Daniel, Owen, Claudia, Solomon, Brett, Yusuf, Ronnie, Adal, Ronan, Ahmad, Thomas, Hugh, Robert, Eric, Nadia, Xavier Ellis, Franklin, Rhys, Ash and Domique."" That last name. I remembered it.

""Give me Domiques full name and why he joined."" My concern was rising.

""His full name was Domique Nicolas Patrick Johnson and he joined cause his brother was captured by the foundation."" It was at this point where my mind fully fell apart. I couldn't believe it. What are the chances?! My own fucking brother! He had always had one out for me but I never thought he would die because of it!

""C-Commander. Are you okay?"" I didn't respond. I simply went up to a wall and slumped down. He had a wife! He had three wonderful children! Why did this have to happen!? Why now?! Why did he care for me so much?!

""H-H-He was my brother.""

""I-I understand. I lost my whole family to these bastards. Do you want to talk about him?"" He sat down next to me. My mind was in disarray. I was lost in my own thoughts.

""Y-Yes."" I was surprised of this persons kindness.

We talked for two hours about my brother. We talked about his children and his wife. We talked about how he was when he was younger. We talked about the times he protected me in situations where he got really hurt because of it. I was surprised of his kindness towards someone who he barely knew.

""Does it feel better?"" His tone was soft and kind.

""It does."" My voice was raspy and sad.

""So, you aren't the commander?"" I guess he realized during my breakdown.

""No, I am [REDACTED_NAME] 5017."" I was terrified I had to shoot him.

""Don't worry, you have had it hard enough. Your secret is safe with me."" My heart calmed down at that point. I felt happy.

""Thank you.""I went back up on my feet.

""I don't need any thanks.""

I then left to the holding places for the prisoners.

""Hey. We have gotten a new order to take the prisoners to the mountain to the west."" My voice had returned to normal again.

""Yes commander."" The two CI soldiers responded.

After 40 minutes, we were back to the place I was dropped off at.

""I'm [REDACTED_NAME].""

""Sorry for-"" He didn't finish the sentence before i had shot him in the head.

""Wait-"" He didn't get much further in his words.

""I have the prisoners. Evac requested.""

""Hello again Steve. What took so long?"" Dr. clef was of course the one who took my call.

""Eh, some complications.""

# I am [REDACTED_NAME] longer prisoner 5017 and quiet days are ahead of me.

&#x200B;

After all of the torture, I will finally be allowed to rest.

I will still talk about the reviews that was before the quiet days because what else do I have to talk about.

Before the quiet days, before the release, I was told to interview prisoner 085 and interact with 1471 and 2935.

After I re-contained 035 and 079 I was sent back down the site and was told to continue like nothing had happened. And I did what they asked.

After learning who I could trust I felt much more comfortable and happy in general.

Anyway, to the interviews.

I was first told to interview 085. She is a sentient sketch, the artist who made her must have been very talented. She communicates through sign language or writing.

I started the interview by writing 'Hello, I am [REDACTED_NAME] 5017 but call me Steve.'

She noticed the text and answered with 'Hello Steve. You are here to interview me right?'

'Yes.' (How in the hell should I describe a conversation by paper?)

'What is it you want to know?'

'Please start with your sight on life in this moment.'

'It is okay. I wish I was able to be in the real world though.'

'I don't get to be there anymore.'

'Can you tell me about it?'

'Sure, tell me what you want to know.'

'How is it where you came from.'

'Last time I was there it was full of beautiful winters, comfortable summers and full of joy all-year around. We had such a good time everyday and we were always a little happy no matter what.'

'Where do you come from? It sounds amazing.'

'Sweden is where I was born. My family is a split between Canadian and Russian. I moved to Ireland. Did you know that there are very few snakes in Ireland.'

'What place were you describing?'

'Although I am [REDACTED_NAME] by birth and Russian and Canadian by blood, I see myself as Irish. So, I was describing Ireland.'

'How did you get to america then?'

'I was on a trip with friends for a year and we needed jobs, We took a job here before I became a prisoner, I was killed and then I re-appeared and was contained. I miss Ireland.'

'I guess that is it then. Goodbye.'

'Goodbye.' She waved at me and I waved back and then left.

I passed by 999 while I was at it. Surprisingly, I was let in.

I remember its smile. It was the happiest thing in existence. It is just pure happiness.

When it hugged my leg this time, I felt a different smell. It was of something I couldn't describe as one singular smell. It was a mix of my brother, Doctor, Beer and something else.

Again, I felt like I could stand still for decades and not feel any stress at all.

Sadly, I had a job to do. I told him the same thing i did the first time and went on my way.

Prisoner 1471-1 is a wendigo like creature who follows you around but never harms you. The reason it is dangerous is because it makes you insane to the point of suicide.

When I got 1471, Malo as it called itself, to follow me it wasn't really scary. I actually felt comfort. It tried to talk to me when I saw it but it never spoke it just moved its mouth up and down.

Malo would appear behind corners, in the mirror and, sometimes, in the open but this was not supposed to happen.

They counted that test as a failure but there was no way to get rid of Malo so I guess he is just with me now.

I was transported in a heavily guarded van to 2935. I don't even know how to explain 2935. All i know is that it was what set me free.

When we got to 2935 I was told to enter the cave. I did as they told.

I was consumed by darkness when I entered the cave. I saw, heard and felt nothing. Not even my feet against the rocks below me. In the darkness I saw Malo and some skeleton like thing talking.

I didn't hear what they were talking about but I know I heard words in the silence.

I saw the people from my life who had died. They were looking at me with smiles. the smiles weren't forced. They looked kind. I felt something in my hand and when I looked down I saw that I no longer had skin, meat or muscle. I was only bone but I was still 'alive'. I felt no pain or tiredness. In my hand I held a scythe and when I looked back up, everyone was gone. Even Malo and the skeleton was gone.

I left the cave and saw the sunlight. I was being aimed at by the foundations military.

""Who are you.""

""I... I am [REDACTED_NAME].""

They backed away when I said it. Why are humans so scared of death? Why are they scared of me?

Right then, it didn't matter. I walked past them and simply walked down the road. I walked until I came home. To my true home.

I walked around the graveyard where my family was buried. When I found their graves they were spirits standing over them.

I walked up to them and when I looked in their eyes, they were happy.

I met them one last time before they left for the infinite sea.

I was sat down by their graves when I heard a voice I never thought I would never hear again.

""Hello Steve."" Dr Clef was as happy as usual.

I didn't respond.

""You okay buddy?"" Who would have guessed. Empathy from Clef.

""I am... Okay."" My voice was hollow and low.

""I brought news and a friend of yours.""

""Hello death."" It was they CI soldier.

""You are alive?"" My surprise was hard to hear through my voice.

""Yes, after what ever you did in that cave, everyone in the world became friendlier towards other. CI and the foundation got into an agreement and we revealed all the prisoners and technology to the world. We are currently preparing a shuttle for space travel."" Clef piped up before my friend could answer.

""They want you to come with the first exploration team as the captain."" My friend said in a tone that was happy and exited.

""I am [REDACTED_NAME] with you."" I sat up with my scythe in hand and started walking towards them.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] new death and I will undo my work to bring back my family. In what ever way I need to.

Oh, I bid farewell to the port and the land, And I paddled away from brave England's white sands. To search for my long ago forgotten friends, To search for the place I hear all sailors end.

As the souls of the dead fill the space of my mind, I'll search without sleeping till peace I can find. I fear not the weather, I fear not the sea; I remember the fallen do they think of me? When their bones in the ocean forever will be.

Plot a course through the night to a place I once knew, To a place where my hope died along with my crew. So I swallow my grief and face life's final test; To find promise of peace and the solace of rest.

As the souls of the dead fill the space of my ears, Their laughter like children their beckoning cheers. My heart longs to join them, sing songs of the sea; I remember the fallen do they think of me? When their bones in the ocean forever will be.

When at last before my ghostly shipmates I stand, I shed a small tear for my home upon land; Though their eyes speak of death filled with struggle and strife, Their smiles below say I don't owe them my life.

As the souls of the dead fill the space of my eyes, And my boat listed over and tried to capsize. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] far from drowning, this far from the sea, I remember the living do they think of me? When my bones in the ocean forever will be.

Now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] down at the darkest abyss - I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure what I want but I don't think it's this - As my comrades call to stand fast and forge on - I make sail for the dawn 'till the darkness has gone -

As the souls of the dead live for'er in my mind; As I live all the years that they left me behind, I'll stay on the shore but still gaze at the sea. I remember the fallen and they think of me; For our souls in the ocean together will be.

This is obviously fake but I like the kind of stories that take something that everyone has a good experience with and twists it to something horrifying.",4
1l7u8z2,1749547352.0,2025-06-10 09:22:32,stories,The government are hunting down kids with superpowers. We are the only ones left.,"I haven’t spoken in exactly two weeks, five days, seven hours, and, according to the clock on my handler’s dashboard, fifty-three minutes. 

I shift in my seat, uncomfortable. The cuffs are cruel but necessary, according to the adults. We’re on a highway. I don’t know which one, just that it wasn't destroyed. 

It's rare to see an intact highway. The radio is on, and I was appreciating old school Taylor Swift until my handler switched it to the news with a violent stab of his finger.

“Good afternoon. It’s 5pm, time for your local and national news and weather forecast,” a woman’s voice buzzes through static, and I immediately lunge forward to turn it off. I haven’t felt suffocated in days, but there it is, that choking sensation twisting in my throat. 

It feels like I’m inhaling smoke, drowning in syrup. Before I can, however, my handler gives me the look. 

There’s a reason he’s been assigned to me. I hear him as clearly as day inside my head. *Don’t even fucking think about it.*

“It’s been six months since the devastating Wildfire incident, and the aftermath continues to affect survivors across the country,” she says, pausing briefly. “Rafe Smallwood, the man responsible for the deaths of more than half a million people, was sentenced to death yesterday and subsequently executed early this morning.”

There’s something cruel and calculated in the way my handler cranks up the volume. 

Shrill static rips through my ears like splintered glass. 

He’s middle aged, his thick brown hair slicked back with foul-smelling gel that burned the back of my nose and throat. 

He's not really a talker, just like me. A big guy with a round stony face. 

Married, though I can't imagine why. I can see the wedding ring he’s tried—failed—to hide in his pocket.

“Despite ongoing appeals from human rights activists claiming he is innocent, the 24-year-old was executed today by lethal injection,” the radio crackled, “According to officials, the body will be returned to his family in the coming weeks. His brain has been donated for scientific research, per federal law.”

I can feel my handler’s eyes on me. He’s waiting for a reaction.

The news anchor continues, and I resist squeezing my eyes shut. My handler knows everything about me. What I've done. Why I'm [REDACTED_NAME], and what’s going to happen to me.  I know nothing about him.

I wish I did; he would already be dead.

“The young man, originally from Mount Lebanon, Pittsburgh, was said to have confirmed psychic mutations resulting in…” 

The window is open and cold air blasts my face as I stick my head out, reveling in the breeze. 

The ruins of what used to be my town fly past in a grayish blur: collapsed buildings and homes, upended sidewalks, and bridges reduced to rubble. The news anchor’s voice collapses into static as we enter a tunnel, and I briefly appreciate the momentary silence.

It doesn’t last. “In other news, the CDC has announced a possible link between…”

My eyes drift back to the dashboard clock. Two weeks, five days, seven hours, fifty-nine minutes since I last spoke. 

I’ve thought about what my first words might be. Do I ask for a lawyer? My parents?

Or maybe I’d just tell everyone to go fuck themselves.

My handler switches the station again, this time to another news anchor.

“Twenty-four-year-old Harper Samuels is set to appear in court today, following—”

He switches it. Again.

Bruce Springsteen.

He smiles, cranks up the volume, and leans back in his seat.

We drive past a Pizza Hut. I miss pizza. Even though the building still stands, the foundations are crumbling, the windows blown out. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] out of my thoughts when my handler jerks the steering wheel to the left. 

In front of us, the road suddenly plummets down into a sinkhole, a gnawing hole of nothingness. Settling into my seat, I relax in the warm leather. I know cars, but I’ve never sat shotgun. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in the back, either in a cage or dumped in the trunk. Always ready to mobilize, to follow orders. 

I shake the thought away.

“Can we get pizza?” I ask, swallowing bile and memories. I might not know my handler, but I know his orders.

He’s already a thousand steps ahead of the people trying to get an interview with me. I know exactly what he’s been told:

Make it look like an accident.

A police car would look suspicious, so I got tucked into the passenger seat of a range rover.

They even had a cover story in case we got pulled over.

“You're a father driving your daughter to Evacuation Zone 3.”

*“Take her somewhere quiet. Don't leave any traces.”* 

I already have a headache, and it's not my handler’s cologne. 

The pain is dull, bright colors zigzagging across my vision. 

It feels intrusive, like a knife is being forced straight through my skull. 

I can briefly see three walls of an alley, his bulging frame between me and freedom. 

“I want pizza,” I say louder, lifting my head. I notice the subtle shift in my handler’s body language. He's good at masking it, but I'm a quick study. He actually smiles. 

“Before you kill me,” I add, my eyes finding the dashboard clock.

It's 6pm— and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to die at 6:30pm, per his orders.

“What kind of pizza?” He surprises me with a response, gesturing ahead. His accent is not what I expected. Boston. I bite back the urge to ask him to say, “Cah-ffee.” 

“Look around, sweetheart. I'll make you a deal. If you point me to a fully functioning McDonald's, I'll go get you a happy meal.”

He's right. There's nothing but a disorienting grey blur of concrete as we drive past. No sign of the golden arches. I focus on the dashboard block, bright red ticking numbers. Numbers are all I know.

I know ticking clocks. I know ceiling tiles. I know squares in carpets and rugs and dress patterns. I’ve been counting all my life. Counting when I'm [REDACTED_NAME], counting when I'm [REDACTED_NAME], counting when I'm [REDACTED_NAME]— and here I am, counting again. 

It's been 2,489 days, 35 hours, 13 minutes and 43 seconds since I had freshly made pizza. Mom used to make it from scratch. I miss cheese. I miss hot, spicy pizza burning my tongue. I miss the first bite.

I am [REDACTED_NAME] with my words, keeping my eyes forward. “You know, even Ted Bundy was given a final meal.”

I catch the slightest smirk curve on his otherwise stony face. “Where'd you learn that?”

“Netflix,” I said. “He refused a final meal, so they gave him the default instead.”

I noticed him relax slightly. “You want a final meal? Sure.” His gaze flicks to the road ahead. “Tell me why you did it first.”

I weigh my next words. I have nothing left to lose. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to die in...

I glance at the dashboard clock.

Twenty-three minutes and eight seconds.

I don’t say what I want to say, what’s bubbling in my throat, what clings stubbornly beneath my tongue. Instead, I stay very still. “Did you know that when you take apart a doll and put her back together, she’s never quite the same?”

Another glance at the clock. Twenty-one minutes.

My handler sighs. Outside, we’ve entered a  city, but I don't recognize it. 

There are no signs anymore, so I don’t know which route we’re on—just the same view I’ve had since being crammed into the passenger seat of this car: a jagged crack tearing through the heart of the country. I think I see the ruins of a hotel, maybe. Then a nail salon. They're still pulling bodies like doll pieces from the rubble.

I look away quickly, ducking my head low. My handler reaches into his pocket, pulls out a cigarette and lights it up. He takes a long drag, blowing smoke out the window.

“I’m not following your analogy, kid.”

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure what an analogy is.

I shut my eyes, refusing to look. I count the seconds anyway, because I can't stop myself. I need to count. Eighteen minutes.

I keep my head bowed as we pass crowds of survivors already banging on the windows. They hold signs and pictures with strangers' faces. When a woman jumps in front of us and slams her hands into the windshield, my handler quickly rolls the window down. I start to panic. 

Chest burning. Throat twisting. It's like barfing, but the screams clogged in my throat are not mine. They taste like blood tinged vomit. I don't look at the clock or at numbers that would normally calm me, because they're already counting down.

“In the fourth grade, I got my first detention.” I try to find an anchor. There are no patches or patterns on the car seats, so I count the scuffs on my jeans. 

I can already sense them. They hit like lightning bolts, each one more painful, like a pickaxe to my skull. 

Every voice makes me want to scream, but I can’t protect myself. 

I can’t block them out with my hands, and even if I did have hands to clamp over my ears, they’d still bleed through. I see them as colors, bright explosions of light illuminating the backs of my eyes. 

I’m not afraid of the dead, of the bodies being pulled from collapsed foundations. 

I’m afraid of the survivors.

They sound like television static. 

*Where is my… son?*

Names I don't know. Men. Women. Children. All of them come alive inside me, voices crashing into each other, disjointed and broken. 

*Where… is my daughter?* 

*I've…….. lost them….. all.* 

*All of them….. are…. dead.* 

*Gone.* 

*I'm [REDACTED_NAME].* 

*I'm [REDACTED_NAME].* 

*I'm [REDACTED_NAME].* 

I try to shake them away, but they are vast. Violent. Voices become images. 

Images become faces. Faces become memories, and some of them are strong enough to leech onto me. *No*. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] one clinging to them, a disease crawling inside their heads. I can see from the point of view of a child. I see her arms fly out for her mother, but her mother is gone. I feel her agony, her loneliness, her pain. I regret letting her in. 

Mommy. Her words crawl up my throat. I can see through her eyes. 

I can see a family table. I can see the proud smile on her teacher’s face. 

Spongebob on the TV and plastic stars on her ceiling. 

I try to shake her away, but it's like pulling myself from quicksand; it's too thick and I'm [REDACTED_NAME], drowning, suffocating, screaming. Like her.

*Mommy, where are you? Where did you go? Where's daddy? There was a bad earthquake, Mommy. I can't find home. I can't find bunny. I can't find Spencer—*

“Out of the way, little girl!”
 
The world jerks violently, and I’m torn from her. Flying. 

But there’s nobody to catch me. I’m propelled forward in my seat as my handler steps on the brake, my eyes snapping open, yanked back by my seatbelt. I can already taste blood in my mouth. I can’t see for a moment; everything is blurry. Her memories splinter.

The girl's name is on my tongue.

Aria. 

We turn down another road leading into the city, and Aria’s thoughts fade to a dull whimper.

Like cell phone service, the further we drive, Aria’s mind detaches from me, piece by piece.

Then she's gone.

I focus on my words— on my last words, the last time I'll be able to tell my story.

“In the fourth grade, I got my first detention.”

“I asked why you killed half a million people,” my handler snaps. His voice is an anchor, creeping back through the silence left behind. “Not your fucking life story.”

I sense movement. He’s only turning down the volume on the radio.

“Go on,” he said, as we approached the city border. 

There's already a long stream of traffic crammed into one single lane ahead of us— and beyond that, a skyline of nothing. 

I feel the breath catch in my throat as we get closer, and the sight twists my gut. 

Proud giants, once standing tall, reduced to dominos toppling into each other. 

My handler sighs when I duck my head further. 

“The traffic isn't letting up so we’re  not going anywhere.” he leaned back in his seat with a defeated exhale.

“The floor’s yours, kid.”

Fine.

He wanted the start? I’d give him the whole novel.

Halfway through Mrs. Trescott’s long, boring lecture on times tables, I realized I had superpowers. 

It wasn’t the first time I’d come to this conclusion. I was sitting with my chin resting on my fist, my pen lodged between my teeth, when I noticed that whenever I glanced at the clock, the hands didn’t move. But when I looked away, somehow, they did move. Magic! 

My pen popped out of my mouth. I was so excited.

I threw my hand up to tell the whole class. Mrs. Trescott just gave me the same look she always gave me when I decided to announce something. I thought it was cool. The other kids didn’t share my excitement.

“Keep your thoughts to yourself, Harper,” Mrs. Trescott said, shooting me a warning look. “Stop daydreaming, and start listening.”

I ducked my head, well aware of my ears burning red. Kids were already giggling. Whispering. Muttering to each other. 

Teachers didn’t like me. I was either too loud or too quiet. 

Kids were ruthless, and there was zero in-between. On my report card, would be, “Harper is a bright child, but…”

She never listens.

She's always in the clouds.

She can't seem to make friends.

But I was listening to my teachers. I just didn’t understand what they were saying.

I didn’t have many friends. I did have a friend called Mica. But then she started talking about boys and makeup, and slowly gravitated toward the other girls. 

I didn't like make-up, and boys were still gross. I read books in the bathroom stalls instead. But that just gave me the unfortunate (and, I guess, genius) nickname Harper Collins. Class ended, and I was eager to make a quick getaway.

I was zipping up my backpack when someone prodded me in the back. 

I twisted around. Evie Hart was one of the most popular girls in class, but only because she had an indoor swimming pool. She was tiny, like a fairy, with red hair pulled into pigtails and always—always—dressed exclusively in pink.

Our moms had been friends when we were babies, so we used to have playdates. Moms really are naive, expecting their kids to be friends too. 

Even back then, I could tell Evie Hart didn’t like me. She liked playing with dolls. I liked playing pirates. 

I could always tell she was patiently waiting to say goodbye, arms folded, nose stuck up, like I was a worm she wanted to stamp on. 

When she was old enough to make her own decisions, Evie pulled me aside after I’d been invited to her slumber party to say “I know my mom keeps inviting you to my house because our moms are friends, but I don’t like you, Harper. I don't want you in my house. Tell your mom you don’t like me.”

So, that was the end of that beautiful friendship. I was blunt with Evie and told her I didn't like her either, and that she looked like a horse. 

That drove a wedge between our moms. I was forced to apologize for “offending” poor, defenseless Evie, who was smirking at me behind her mother’s back. Evie, the spoiled brat, got what she wanted, and my mother quietly removed her mom from family gatherings.

Evie only prodded me in the back when she wanted something. She was smiling, which was rare. Evie only wore that type of smile when she was about to ruin someone's day. ""Hey, Harper.""

Evie’s smile was suspiciously friendly. She grabbed my shoulders and turned me toward the back of the classroom, where our teacher was helping Freddie with his backpack zipper.

""I dare you to ask Mrs. Trescott what DILF stands for.""

I wasn't expecting someone to actually *say* it. 

The voice came from a freckled brunette hunched over his desk, eyes glued to his 3DS.

Mrs. Trescott’s head snapped up, her expression darkening. I caught Freddie’s smirk.

""I'm [REDACTED_NAME], *what* was that?""

""I just told you,"" the boy muttered, idly chewing his stylus. “That's what it means.”

""Detention, Rafe,"" Mrs. Trescott barked. “You too, Evelyn. You should know better.”

The boy, Rafe, dropped his 3DS, eyes wide.

""But… I was just saying what it means!""

""Detention,"" Mrs. Trescott repeated, her tone a warning. ""Do not argue with me.""

""But—""

""Rafe,"" she snapped. ""Do you want me to call your father?""

Rafe’s mouth snapped shut. Instead of talking back, he buried his head in his arms, groaning. ""This is so stupid! I didn’t even mean it! I was saying what it meant!""

""But Mrs. Trescott,” Evie sang. “Harper said it too—”

*“I don't care for playground politics,”* my handler grumbles, snapping me back to the present. 

It's raining. Fat droplets strike the windscreen, trailing down the glass. The sky is darker. Which means I'm [REDACTED_NAME] out of time. I risk a glance at the dashboard clock. 15 minutes and eight seconds glares back. 

We idle under a red light beneath the foreboding shadow of a skyscraper looming like a wounded god. The heart of the city is as depressing as the rest of the road. If I squint, I can see Lady Liberty's head—or what's left of it—her iconic emerald crown, poking from the Hudson. 

I've seen movies like this. But there was always a monster, always something to be afraid of. I lean my head against the window. I can see shady alleyways still standing, even shallow sinkholes where my body can be disposed of. 

Another glance at the clock. 13 minutes and twenty three seconds. 

My handler taps his fingers on the wheel. “I don’t want any fodder, kid,” he mutters, eyes on the road. The light flashes green, and we jerk forwards. 

“Get to the point.”

So much for stalling. 

Detention was just the three of us. Evie and Rafe sat in the back row, whispering and tapping their pens, while I slumped in a front-row seat, half-asleep. 

I was the only one who noticed when Mrs. Trescott reached into her desk and pulled out a gun. Her eyes didn’t blink. Her arms moved like they weren’t hers, like a marionette. It happened so fast. Almost too fast to register what was happening. 

She raised the gun, shoved it into her mouth, and I couldn’t move. I opened my mouth to scream, but nothing came out. I was frozen. Couldn’t cry. Couldn’t breathe.

The BANG splintered through the silence, where there had only been my shuddery breaths. Her body swayed like a puppet, then collapsed face-first onto her desk.

Red bloomed across the papers she’d been grading, moving fast, seeping from the edges. I didn’t realize I was screaming until I heard my own wail. Didn’t realize I was on the floor, on my knees, screaming. 

I could still hear the gunshot rattling in my skull. The others were silent. 

Out of the corner of my eye, they sat stiff in their seats, unmoving and wide-eyed, like mannequins. I could hear Rafe’s sharp breaths, like he was hyperventilating.

The world tipped sideways and I dove under my desk, screaming until my throat was raw and wrong, my hands clamped over my ears. 

Everything was so *loud*, screeching in my skull. The ringing in my head, the crack of the bullet. It felt like years had passed before warm hands were coaxing me to my feet. But I was still screaming. I could still hear the gunshot. 

Still see the blood. “Harper?” The voice was a stranger’s. They led me all the way outside, squeezing my hand tightly. I barely remembered leaving the classroom.

It was raining, but I didn’t feel the drops soaking into my shirt and hair. Adults crowded around me, but none of them were my parents. 

I was lifted into the back of a white van. Evie and Rafe were already inside, wrapped in blankets. Rafe had his head buried in his knees. Evie stared forward, like she could see something I couldn’t. 

The stranger, a middle-aged man with glasses, knelt in front of me. 

To me, he was a fast-moving blur. I blinked, and his face swam into view. “Sweetie, it’s okay now. You’re safe.” 

I felt the jolt as the van began to move. He addressed all three of us in a low murmur, almost a whisper.

“Don't worry, your parents have been informed,” his expression darkened, and I could glimpse through his facade. He was clinical. Quite cold. 

“Cases like these require immediate treatment, following the Children First law.” He held out his hand, though none of us shook it. 

“Hello! My name is [REDACTED_NAME]. Wonder, and I’m from the Children’s Trauma Defence Division,” his voice was soft, like ocean waves crashing in my ears as the van swayed me back and forth. 

“Call it witness protection, but for your age. It’ll only be for a few weeks. Think of it like a vacation! We get to make sure you three are A-okay, and you get to miss school!” 

He chuckled and leaned back. “Now, doesn't that sound like fun?”

*“Dr. Wonder?”* my handler interrupts again, pulling me back to reality. Eleven minutes and three seconds. “Why did your fourth-grade teacher even *have* a gun?”

I relax into my seat. “It was something like that.”

He scoffs. “Tell the story correctly, or don't tell it at all.”

I open my mouth to answer, but blurred flashing red lights ahead clamp it shut. 

“Shit,” he mutters. “Don’t move.”

We come to a stop at a roadblock and he tells me to duck my head. I don’t. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] scared. Maybe this is the point where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to be executed. 

He shoves me down anyway, and already, voices stab at the back of my head. The window slides open, ice cold air prickling the back of my neck. 

“Afternoon.” My handler greets a looming shadow outside, and I get a single flash: an empty bed, and a room littered with beer bottles. 

“Who’s the passenger?” Border control asks. I sense the man leaning in. Another flash, stronger this time. A wedding. 

Bright yellow explodes across my vision. A newborn. Yellow turns to a sickly green. 
A woman screams, and the colors twist and contort to dark blue. Nuclear pain strikes the back of my head, sharp and intrusive. 

I try to shake away the splintered images: a ruined wedding, a single meal for one, that same newborn now a teenager. Red bleeds to dark purple. *“I fucking hate you, Dad,”* the teenager’s voice trickles from him to me, and his grief crashes over me. 

It tastes like expired milk. Feels like a knife being plunged into my skull. I swallow it down, but it crawls back up my throat, following an eruption of pain in my temples. *“You’re a piece of shit.”* 

Another flash. I try to blink it back, but it's relentless. The boy is dead, his body crushed under collapsed foundations. 

There’s a long pause before the officer speaks out loud. “Is she doing all right, sir?”

I can sense the silence around us thickening as I clamp my teeth around a mouthful of bile. I see a police badge, a faucet, and a fistful of blue tinted pills. 

He's growing suspicious. 

When he asks me to lift my head, I stay still. Paralyzed. “Yeah, sorry, it’s just my daughter,” my handler replies smoothly. 

“Taking her to Evacuation Zone 3. Hoping to get her into Canada.” I feel his hands awkwardly patting me on the back. “Maddy’s feeling a little car-sick.

Maddy. 

Maybe he has kids. 

Another excruciating pause, and I feel the officer move back. 

So do his thoughts, bungeeing. Detaching. Splintering into fragmented nothing. “All right then, sir, go on ahead.” he says, and the window rolls back up. I don't move until the taste of sour milk mixed with whiskey and toothpaste leaves my mouth. 

“Not yet,” my handler snaps when I risk jerking my head up. He takes a sharp turn, and I almost topple off the seat. The road is quieter. There are no voices. 

“Keep your head down.” 

I can hear the rain pouring now, heavy drops drumming against the window. The low hum of the engine is comforting. 

“So, you guys saw your teacher shoot herself in the head and were put in witness protection, and that's why you decided to flatten half of the country?”

“No,” I manage to whisper. I avoid the dashboard clock as eleven minutes tick down to ten—then nine. “At first, it was like being on vacation,” I choose my words carefully. 

The Children's Trauma Defence Division was a towering glass building with checkerboard windows, a labyrinth of clinical white hallways, and spiral staircases.

But there were no real windows. Whenever I thought I'd found one, I was only peering into another room.

I had my own room with a bed and a desk. I didn’t like the clinical, hospital-like feel or the stink of antiseptic polluting every hallway. 

But the place did have a swimming pool and a games room, where I spent most of my time. 

In between, we had private trauma therapy sessions. Dr. Wilhelm made it clear we’d be staying for two weeks, and then our parents would collect us. So, we made the most of it.

Evie and I were forced to talk. She turned to me while we were playing Monopoly in the games room and said, with these wide, unblinking eyes, “Do you think Rafe is looking at me?”

I guessed that, with me being the only other girl in the room, she had no choice but to gossip with me. 

I was ten years old, so no, I didn’t think Rafe, who was sitting across from us, staring into space with his hands clenched into fists, was looking at her. 

We didn’t talk about the elephant in the room, because Evie was still having panic attacks, and Rafe slipped into a trance-like state every time I was brave enough to bring up what we saw. 

That night was the last time I saw Evie and Rafe for a while. I expected to be sent home in the morning. 

But when I was woken by a nurse, instead of breakfast, I was gently pulled into a small white room. 

There was a table with a plate of eggs, sunny side up, toast soldiers, and a glass of fresh orange juice. The nurse introduced herself as Dr. Caroline. 

She took a seat at her littered desk, and gestured for me to sit down and begin eating. I did. The cafeteria food was either oatmeal or mystery meat, so eggs were a surprise. I was asked questions while I ate. 

Just the usual ones, like my hobbies and my favorite school subjects. 

I told her I hated math, and she said, “I don't like math either. Do you like counting, Harper? Can you count to twenty for me?” 

She was getting closer. I was on my last mouthful of eggs when I felt the prick at the back of my neck. It hurt. 

A chill ran down my spine, like she was pouring ice down my back. 

My fork clattered to my plate and I almost choked when her ice-cold fingers pressed a band-aid into place. “Don't worry,” she said, “It's just something to make your mind less scary.”

*“That's rough, kid.”* 

Presently, my eyes are burning; tears are rolling down my cheeks. 

“We were ten years old,” I tell my handler, squeezing my eyes shut. This time, I refuse to look at the clock. Eight minutes and four seconds to tell our story. I don't expect sympathy, but I haven't cried in so long. Crying was weak, I was told.

Crying wasn't the *correct* response.

It stopped feeling like a vacation when those pricks in my neck became more frequent.

We were drugged every morning with a sharp stab to the neck. There were always eggs and juice waiting for me.

On the fourth day, I threw it all back up. I remember seeing red specks in my vomit, and my stomach hurt. My head hurt. 

Everything hurt. When I lay down on my bed, my body felt wrong and stiff, like I was a puppet on strings. I asked if I could go home, but I got the same response:

“Oh, Harper, it hasn't been two weeks yet! Don't worry, you can go home soon! Just a few more days!”

Days bled into weeks, and then months. We were isolated in suffocating white rooms. No parents. I didn’t see the others for a whole three months, and in that time, I realized counting was my only escape.

I was left on my own for days without food or water. I started to count ceiling tiles. 

Then the tiles on my floor. Then my breaths. My ceiling had exactly 5,678 and a half tiles. I had to drop down to my knees and count every single floor tile to be completely accurate. 18, 127.

When the voices started whispering in my head, they called it idiopathic schizophrenia. It's a trauma response, Harper, they told me. 

But the voices got louder. Even with more tests and silver tubes in my arm, and surgery I didn't want. 

They cut off all my hair and told me I would start to feel so much better. 

But sitting in a small, dimly lit white room with my head submerged in ice cold water, those voices only deepened, rooting themselves inside my head. I could hear Dr. Caroline, like buzzing static. 

Her voice tripped up, fading in and out, but she was getting clearer. *Can you hear me, Harper?.*

I nodded, and she gently withdrew my head from the water. I shivered, blinking back ice cold drops. 

“You're getting better,” she told me— but I didn't feel better. The voices were louder than the ones spoken out loud. Several months went by, and my hair slowly grew back. I started to see voices as colors, and then *taste* them. 

Dr. Caroline said, while my *disease* was curable, I had to learn how to understand it. 

I saw Rafe one morning while I was being escorted to Testing Room A. 

He looked like he was heading to the cafeteria, led by a blonde woman. His hands were cuffed behind his back. 

Rafe was wearing the exact same outfit as me, a white tee and matching pants. His hair was longer now, and a white bandage was wrapped around his head. 

He surprised me with a friendly smile.

“Hi, Harper!” Rafe said, as we passed each other. His *other* voice, however, was more of a growl, slamming into me, exploding hues of yellow and orange streaking across my vision. *”Not her*. 

I squeezed my eyes shut, but it wasn’t just his voice this time. 

There was a violent flash, one I couldn't  blink away. I saw an identical white room to mine. There was a bed, a table, and a single soda can situated in the middle. 

*Pain*. I felt it like knives sticking into the back of my head.

But it wasn’t mine. Neither were the hands speckled with blood.

I was in someone’s else’s body. 

No. I thought dizzily. 

I was inside Rafe’s mind. 

I saw Dr. Caroline’s hard eyes, her lips carved into a scowl. 

“It’s not hard, Rafe,” she snapped, and more blood hit his palms, running in thick rivulets. 

The soda can toppled onto its side, and I felt his body weaken, his knees hitting the ground, his hands clawing at his hair. 

Dr. Caroline sighed, picked up the can, and placed it back onto the table.

“Harper?”

I didn't realize I was paralyzed until my nurse gently tugged on my hand. “Come on, sweetheart. Dr. Caroline is waiting.”

Rafe was glaring at me, his lip curled. *“This is all HER fault,”* his other voice spat. 

I saw another flash, bright red bleeding across my vision. This time a soda  can violently slammed into the wall, exploding on impact. Rafe met my gaze. 

*“What is SHE looking at?”* He looked away, ducking his head to avoid me. 

His other voice exploded into vicious buzzing, agony ripping across the back of my skull. *“Stop STARING at me, HARPER COLLINS.”*

I counted a full year before I was allowed to see Evie and Rafe again. I was twelve years old when the two of them entered the playroom we first entered a year ago. 

Evie sat in the corner, cross legged, and buried her head in her knees. She was silent. Even her *other* voice was silent. 

Her hair was longer, pulled into a ponytail, dark shadows underlining her eyes. Rafe pulled out a game of Jenga, built a tower, and then knocked it down without touching it. 

He repeated it three times, loudly building a tower and knocking it down with a single jerk of his neck. Rafe was building a fourth, when a voice sliced into the silence. 

“Stop.”

Evie’s voice was barely a croak. 

Rafe *did* stop. He stopped completely, freezing in place, a Jenga brick still in his hand. Evies voice scared me. 

It scared her too, because after staring at a frozen Rafe, her eyes wide and filled with tears, she whispered, “I'm [REDACTED_NAME], you can move now.”

Rafe wasn't as mad as I thought. He just continued building Jenga towers. 

It became increasingly obvious we wouldn't be going home, and the more time I spent with the others, I realized why. 

Rafe had headaches and nosebleeds  and objects lost gravity around him. 

Sometimes the ground would shake when he got mad. Evie stopped speaking, terrified of her commanding voice. Instead, she insisted on carrying around a notepad. 

Our “symptoms” were PTSD, the adults claimed. 

We were… sick. 

Traumatized. 

Overactive imaginations. 

Adolescents. 

It was puberty. 

Blah, blah, blah. We were always given the same BS. “We’re the *adults* and you're the children— we know better than you.”

However, we were officially diagnosed with (psy)chic phenomena. ""Psy,"" according to Dr. Wilhelm, was a specific mutation in our brains triggered by significant trauma during childhood. I was even given an official name for the other voice—the one I heard even when lips weren't moving: 

Neuroempathy. 

Rafe had Psychokinetic Syndrome (PKS), and Evie was diagnosed with Thalamic Control Disorder (TCD).

When we were twelve, Rafe launched a Range Rover across a parking lot, and then slept a whole week. I saw masked people marching in and out of his room. 

The next time I saw him, his hair had been sheared off. 

Evie compelled a guard to shoot himself. She didn't mean it— and least that's what her *other* voice kept screaming. I remember the feeling of blood spraying my face, warm against my skin. 

Rafe tried to run, and was quickly captured and wrestled to the ground. 

We were twelve. 

The adults all told us the same thing: we were fine. 

These symptoms would pass as we entered our teenage years. 

They said we didn’t *really* see brain chunks flying out of the guard’s skull. 

That was just our hormones. 

We just had such *vivid* imaginations.

Rafe decapitated his mother on Visitors’ Day. It was the first and only time I saw my mother. Our parents were allowed inside the cafeteria. I listened to my mom’s other voice, the one too scared to touch me, while her real voice told me she loved me. 

The room was so loud. I could barely hear her other voice over everyone else’s.

Rafe’s mother was loud, both her real and other voice. She demanded to know why his hair was so short, why she could no longer recognize her son. Rafe sat stiff in his chair. He was mute, silent. Only his eyes moved, flicking back and forth. 

He terrified me. One moment his mother was screaming at him. 

The next, a horrific *squelching* sound sent the room into a panic.  

Rafe had snapped his mother’s head clean off her neck, leaving a sharp skeletal stump and a body that, for a moment, jerked like it was still alive.

Rafe dropped to his knees, screaming, and the ceiling caved in, crushing my mother to death. 

I still remember her sputtering *other* voice telling me to *stay away*. 

We were fucking *twelve*. 

Rafe was dragged away, hysterical, every light splintering, every device going dark, the ground rumbling beneath my feet. I didn’t see him or Evie until our first deployment at the age of seventeen. 

I had counted exactly 258,789 ceiling tiles by the time I was seventeen years old. 

My hair had grown all the way down to my stomach. I didn't remember why my room was covered in blood; why my own shit  was smeared across the walls. I didn't remember anything except sunny side up eggs. 

I was lying on my back counting shit stains on my ceiling when I was pulled from my tiny room. 

I didn't know the day or the time or the year. 

I was fifteen the last time I looked in the mirror. My hands were bloody from trying to claw out my own throat. 

I was led down those same spiraling hallways, but this time I knew each one.

I knew my guard, even when her face was masked. Suzie. She had two daughters and a husband. 

When she grabbed my wrist, Suzie was careful to wear gloves. 

If she didn’t, I would tell her that her husband was dead and that she had murdered her own children, dumping their entrails down the toilet and eating the rest. 

Dr. Wilhelm met me outside, where I was stuffed into the back of a police van and given orders to track down a drug dealer. 

I could already smell him. He was halfway across town, and I was seeing his entire life, abandoned at the age of eight and forced to raise himself.

I saw grimy hotel bathrooms and women taking advantage of him, a deluge of green and brown drowning my vision. 

His thoughts smelled like barf.  I led the chase across town. 

It was my job to track the people down, and I would leave the rest to the others. 

It had been so long since I’d seen them that I barely recognized Evie when she jumped out of the passenger seat of the Hummer. She wore an oversized sweatshirt, the hood pulled over dyed black hair hanging in half-lidded eyes. 

Her hands were tied behind her back, and yet the adults surrounding her looked afraid. 

Evie was known as an omen. When she appeared, the air turned cold, and flocks of birds scattered across the sky. 

I could see my breath as she screamed with that other voice, a sound so powerful it drove me to my knees. 

She commanded the man to stop, but somehow, he kept running.

Rafe wasn’t usually brought on these types of missions. 

He was considered a last resort. But this guy was high-profile, so they needed him. 

The seventeen-year-old was dragged from the back of the car, muzzled, a bag pulled from his head. With a single glance, Rafe flung the perp into a dumpster. When told, *“That’s enough,”* He tore the guy to shreds and used his intestines to choke the corpse. He didn’t look at me. He didn’t even look at himself. Rafe was covered in blood, guts, and dirt. His hair was thick, plastered over wide, unblinking eyes.

He didn’t speak, snarling whenever anyone but his handler got too close.

When Evie shot me a wide grin, I realized she no longer had a tongue.

*“Harper,* her other voice giggled in my head. *”It's nice to see you again!”*

On the ride home, the three of us sat in the back. Rafe rested his head on my shoulder. I pretended not to hear his *other* voice. 

We were a team, a special team hunting bad people. Also known as The Wildfire unit—

*“That's enough, kid.”* My handler snaps me out of it.

I open my eyes and look at the clock. 6:28pm. 

The car has stopped, and everything is silent.

I smile as my handler pushes open the door and leads me out into the guttered streets. We walk the edge of a crack that splits the earth in two. I like the feel of raindrops trickling down the back of my neck. He shoves me into a narrow alley. 

The ice cold butt of his gun finds my spine.

But I'm [REDACTED_NAME] afraid.

There are no other voices.

Just silence, and I revel in it.

“So? Why’d you do it, kid?”

Why *did* I do it?

After they drugged me, strapped me down, and extracted my bone marrow while I was still conscious. After ripping Evie’s voice away and turning Rafe into a glorified attack dog. Why did I combust every brain? Why did I let Rafe out of his cage to shred Dr. Wilhelm’s face from the bone?

Why did Evie crawl into every American citizen’s head and tell them to die?

Why did Rafe split the world in half with a single panic attack?

I feel myself smiling as my handler’s gun briefly leaves my spine so he can reload it.

“Because we’re kids!” I laugh, and close my eyes. “We don't know any different.”

6:30.

I can already sense her footsteps, and I revel in each one.

*“Put the gun in your mouth,”* Evie’s *other* voice orders my handler. I sense his resolve crumbling. His arms drop to his sides.

*“And pull the trigger.”*

I don’t even jump when his blood splatters the back of my neck.

When I twist around, Evie isn’t smiling. At twenty-four years old, she’s still tiny. I raise my brows at her choice of clothes: a wedding dress.

I notice a slow trickle of red seeping from her nose. Evie only has one question.

*“Where’s Rafe?”*",34
1jm0dzl,1743182544.0,2025-03-28 17:22:24,stories,A sad love story from souls sisters.,"Today I woke up, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my usual coffee. It's an Expresso vianés. I don't if in English is the same, but I don't mind say in Spanglish.

This story if for the community, to share some part of me, if you like why I shared it, I would say it in my appreciation. Should I begin? 

When I was 12 years old I felt in love at first sight for a girl. I have Asperger, so love wasn't my thing back then. 

She was in my same school. I was in my last year of elementary school and she was and her first of  middle school. I met her in my first year as freshman. 

Even though it was in grade more than me, she was my same age. She a girl as me, she was blond as me, light eyes as me... In a Caribbean country, where brown people are more usual than us. 

I discovered my feeling because I dream when she almost kissed me and I understood why I couldn't stop thinking of that girl. I wasn't afraid because she was the same gender as me, I was pissed off because this was my first love and fuck, emotions are annoying. 

I was like a normal person, but not a normal girl. I didn't like the imposed roll in society for women and always fight it. But was a religious school and well. Not a hardcore one, to me wasn't an horror, but in some kind got my amount of female bullies. 

As the people knew as a gossip about my feeling she noticed and my friends realize she felt the same for me. I had never an intentions because to me was so... Far away, and she felt the same. 

Here start the problems: she and her family was religious. She hides being another bully in the shadows. Both got obsessed with the another and later on she had her first boyfriend to hide the situation. 

All he family always knew and she preferred to hided and bully me than trust in me. That stroyed me cause well... Either way I didn't lost hope, I was young and naive. 

She stayed and the shadows and I realized she was stalking me when was in college. I did the same and she blocked me, treated me like a paria. I respeat myself: young and naive. 

The stalking became worst, almost felt like she felt like she was in a serious relationship with me in the shadows. Asperger and naive. 

We move to the same country, she got married and had children. I wanted a closure without pass her boundaries and got her email, cause she has a unique name. In the bar of Gmail was easy to find it without testing 2 times. 

I send it a emails to talk about the situation with a coffee, she treated me like a paria again but she rejected me in text. 

She always used other people or silence to bully me. Passed 16 years and because I had the guts to end the story send her a email to had my closure to all that love the put in anonymous or random people that text me to say things that only she knees about me. 

In the shadows I was almost her wife, in the real world a crazy bitch. I was beyond the word disappointment. At this point I knew the person that I first met died because of her shadow, bad habits and metal health problems. 

The moment I knew she was married and later on with a children the mug that I repare with golden glue as the Japanese art a philosophy got smashed. The duel only was one week. I got more than enough of this. 

Commitment and love to dignity was always my gold as a person. I try all my life to be treated as a person and not a second class of citizen, a crazy one because was different.

 I try all days to be a decent person. Love and help other people and say sorry and correct my behavior if I behaved wrongly. Not because I'm a religious person and I want a reward. Not because I want people to love me back.

 But because I want to die happy because I was a person that put as many grains of sand as I could to make the world a better place. Even in my small hands. That person that I loved so much, become in what I hate I combat everyday: A unloyal and corrupt person. 

So... Why I tell my story? Because I see you all waiting for the love of their life coming to your lifes. Feeling guilty and pity because made a mistake and never had the gut to confront the person. 

This sub had become a place to feel selft pitty instead of real communication. I like this sub because is one of the only ones that hasn't have censorship from reddit. I still can talk here. 

Please... If you really love that person, do something about it or someone will come to get away from you. Become a fighter, a go getter. Because in war and love everything is valid. 

If you screwed up and really feel sorry, have the gut to say it to the person you hurt, not to stranger in reddit. 

Strangers... Become in something you feel proud when you die. If you have family or other people, they remember you as a community builder, not a shadow person. 

Everybody will die, if someone is important to you, say it before is too late. Don't die with regrets. Wish you a anonymous with nothing more that a humble advice. 

P.D: this post was made it in music inspiration. I write it with a song in repeat. If you want to listen what I listened writing it, the song is ""Comptine d'un Autre été: L'Après-Midi"" from Yann Tiersen.

1id0ca2,1738174267.0,2025-01-29 18:11:07,stories,The Beat Between Us,"The four of us burst out laughing as we made our way to Stand C, Bay 9, watching Nick flick the fourth Coldplay wristband—determined that even his bum should light up when the bands did.

After what felt like a journey to the ends of the earth, we finally found seats 48-51. I stood still, taking in the sheer grandeur of the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the air thick with anticipation radiating from every Coldplay fan around me. And then, in that moment, I remembered how I wish Coldplay’s *Yellow* would fix the damage Australia’s yellow did to us—right here. Tears streamed down my face.

And immediately, I became the subject of mockery—because, seriously, who cries even before the opening singers have made their appearance, duh!?

After quickly wiping off the waterworks—and the mascara streaks that came with them—I flashed an awkward smile at Vicky, Nick, and Tanya before preparing to take my seat.

**DAAAMNNN ITTT!**

I was *this* close to sitting on actual pigeon shit. Literal, disgusting, green-and-white pigeon shit, smeared all over my corner seat, threatening to ruin my little black dress.

I had been looking forward to this concert ever since I found out Mother T (yes, I’m a Swiftie) wasn’t bringing the *Eras Tour* to India, but Coldplay *might.* Scoring tickets wasn’t in my fate—between five people and twelve devices queued up, the show still sold out in seconds. But Nick, miracle worker that he is, somehow managed to get four tickets at a reasonable price, and that’s how we ended up in Ahmedabad.

Since that day, I had it all planned: black dress, red lips, blush blindness, rhinestones, chunky sneakers—*perfection.* What I *hadn’t* planned for? Pigeon poop. And there was no way I was letting it ruin the most important day of my year so far.

But dear lord, my *""damn it""* was loud. *Too* loud. Loud enough to turn a few heads as I froze mid-squat, narrowly escaping disaster. And of course, the other three? Manic laughter. What else was I supposed to expect from my homies?

Just then, I felt a soft hand on my shoulder, and the air around me filled with the dreamiest cologne—neither too musky nor too woody, not overly floral or fruity—just the perfect balance of it all, with a subtle hint of aqua.

My eyeballs, which had momentarily popped out in surprise, snapped back into their sockets as I turned, half-squinting, toward the hand resting on me.

Black rolled-up sleeves. Metal watch. Forearm tattoo.

Okay. I *really* needed to stop obsessing over the tiny details and actually look up at the owner of this veiny hand.

My first reaction? A full-on, awkward jaw drop—because, hello, it’s not every day that a 5’11”-something guy in a black shirt and dark blue denim, smelling like absolute perfection, with slicked-back hair and warm brown eyes, walks up to you offering tissues to save your seat from an unfortunate fate.

When Tanya gave me a slight nudge on my shoulder, I finally snapped back to reality, smiled at him, thanked him, and dreaded the disgusting task ahead—actually cleaning the chair. Just then, to my relief, a cleaning lady appeared and volunteered to do it for me.

When I finally took my seat, he was still there, talking to Nick and Vicky. I’ll never understand how guys can become best buddies within 10 minutes of meeting each other, but I saw it happening. Okay, maybe not *best* buddies, but they were laughing together like they’d known each other for years. They’d all introduced themselves, but I hadn’t caught his name. I was too much of an introvert to ask, or maybe the butterflies fluttering in my stomach physically made me incapable of uttering a word when I saw his perfectly clean-shaven face with a jawline so sharp, I swear I’d bleed if I ran a finger along it.

*“Stop it, you idiot.”*

But he’s the hottest guy I’ve seen in forever.  
  
*“And you’re making a fool out of yourself by staring at him like that.”*  
  
Have you looked at his oval face? Those eyes, that perfect nose, and those perfectly toned arms? How am I not supposed to drool? Also, have you seen that smile? The most perfect set of teeth I’ve ever seen.  
  
*“You’re 5 feet 1, 5 feet 5 in your 4-inch heels. You can now stop imagining yourself with him.”*

*But... I…* Okay, now he’s gone. Good job, brain, on distracting me with these conversations. The least you could’ve done was muster the courage to get his name.  
Can I ask the guys his name? Sure.  
Do I want to be teased for the rest of the concert? No way in hell.

So, that’s it then? You just saw a hot guy at the Coldplay concert who offered you tissues?

We settled in as Elyanna performed her Arabic, and honestly, mind-blowing version of *Deewani Mastani*. But my side-eye kept doing its thing, scanning the area where he’d been seated. My heart just wouldn’t let me forget about the hot guy who offered to help without me even asking, and who immediately clicked with my friends. I looked around a few more times, but he was nowhere to be found. Dejected, I sank back into my seat, focusing on the show.

As the sun set and Jasleen took over, my attention started to drift. I got up to refill my water bottle, knowing we’d need it for when we started screaming and dancing to Chris’ tunes. Looking at the crowd at the counter, and knowing my tiny stature, I knew this was going to be a challenge. Just then, I lost grip of my bottle, that black-sleeved, veiny hand appeared again—this time, holding my bottle. It disappeared for a second, then reappeared with a full one in its place.

*“Hmmm, that was a 1L bottle, which would’ve taken at least 2 minutes to fill to the brim, and you stood there frozen in time. Good job, you.”*

“There you go.”

“Thank you so much, I... it was a...”

“I know, the crowd can get a little mad and...”

He eyed me up and down.

“…tiny people can get lost.” He chuckled.

I’m not a fan of being called tiny, but it’s even worse when people joke about it.

“I could’ve managed. I’ve lived my life so far without a...”

I eyed him up and down too.

“…6-feet-something swooping in to help me refill my water bottle.”

And of course, he chuckled. Again.

A hand landed on my shoulder.

“*Wow, guy, you’re fast.* Good thing you’re hot, or I’d’ have labelled this creepy. But, for now, I’ll allow it.”

We started walking back to our seats, and he said something, but I couldn’t hear it over the loud music and commotion. I looked up at him, and it felt like time froze. I locked eyes with his light brown ones, and I’d like to think he looked into mine too. The hand that had been on my shoulder pulled me closer. I opened my mouth, desperate to help my body catch its breath. Golden hour sunlight bathed his perfect face, and his skin glowed like it was straight out of a dream. I could smell mint on his breath. He bent down, and I wasn’t ready for that.

*“Why are you freezing with every move of his, you stupid, stupid girl?”*

He pulled his hand from my shoulder, gently brushing my hair out of my face, and whispered, “I’m two rows behind you, sweetheart. You can stop your side-eye search now.” He handed me my water bottle and disappeared into the crowd.

I finally regained control over my limbs and walked down the stairs. As I looked to my left, two rows before of my seat, I saw him—laughing, singing, and recording videos with two other guys.

Just a glance at him slapped an ear-to-ear smile on my face, and I made my way back to my seat.

“Cause you got, A HIGHER POWER…”

Coldplay had arrived with a bang, and for a solid 10 minutes, I forgot about everything around me—the world, the guy—and was completely lost in the magic of Chris and the band. It felt like a dream come true, seeing them perform live right before my eyes! The fireworks, the lights, the glowing wristbands—it was pure magic.

When Chris sat down and sang, *“When she was just a girl, she expected the world,”* I was transported back to when I was 15, dreaming of independence—of traveling the world on my own, of doing the things I love, like going to concerts like this one. I swayed with my eyes closed and my hand raised in the air, having my own little moment of euphoria.

I finally opened my eyes and turned to grab my hair tie from my handbag, which had taken my place on the seat. When I looked up, I saw him casually glancing in my direction, smiling. I turned back to double-check that he was smiling at me. I gave him a confused frown with a half-smile, and he mouthed, *“You look beautiful tonight.”* Blood rushed to my cheeks, turning them a soft shade of pink.

Tanya, having caught on to the vibe, teased, “Found something more interesting than Chris up there, have we?”

I brushed it off with a smile and turned back toward the stage.

*Viva La Vida* is one of my all-time favorite Coldplay songs, and I couldn't miss the chance to capture a video of the gang vibing to it. I asked Vicky to take a “0.5x flash on” video of all of us with the stage in the background.

He watched Vicky struggle to fit us all into the frame and offered to take the video himself. I got shy and suggested, “Let’s just get a picture instead.”

Once that little charade was over, Vicky invited him and his friends to join us where we were sitting. I’ve told you, guys and their instant friendships are beyond me, but I wasn’t complaining. Somehow, he ended up right next to me—except Tanya, of course, swooped in and took the seat between us. She *knew* there was chemistry and couldn’t resist teasing us.

Then, *Hymn for the Weekend* and *Charlie Brown* played, and the seven of us danced like there was no tomorrow.

As the music shifted to *“Look at the stars, look how they shine for you,”* Tanya grabbed my hand, twirled me to her left, and then it hit me—*Yellow* was playing, and I was next to him. Butterflies. Increased heart rate. All of it hit me at once. I was too slow to process anything, and before I knew it, Tanya handed me over to him. In the next twirl, he turned me around.

It felt like the universe was playing with me that night because, just as Chris sang *“It was all yellow,”* I felt his hand slide to my waist. He pulled me closer, his voice a low murmur in my ear. *“I don’t know if you’re my yellow, but tonight... look up. Look at the stars. They’re shining for you.”*

I looked down, blushing, as he took my hand and gestured if I was okay to join him at his seat. We were in public, so I wasn’t entirely worried about going off with a near stranger. Besides, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable with him around my friends, so this seemed like the perfect chance to step away. I knew I’d have to face the questions back at the hotel, but that was a *later me* problem. With all his friends still standing near our seats, the idea of heading up with him sounded brilliant.

I took his hand, and we started walking up.

My brain was completely absorbed by Chris and Coldplay, marveling at the beauty of the show they had crafted. Meanwhile, my heart, distracted, forgot to do its job—skipping a beat every time he grabbed my hand or looked at me a certain way.

An hour and a half had passed, and I’d managed to get one video of us together. As I panned the camera toward us, he playfully hid his face in my neck, under my hair, barely visible, while I couldn’t help but giggle.

I knew the concert was about to end, and the realization hit me a little too hard. I was visibly sad when he leaned down and asked, “Are you okay, sweetheart?” We had met only three hours ago, yet he was so comfortable calling me “sweetheart,” and the way it made me feel so cherished amazed me.

“It’s going to be over soon,” I muttered.

I moved in closer to him, and he wrapped his arm around me. It wasn’t exactly a hug, but we were side by side, close.

“I know. But it’s going to be alright. You’re going to be fine.”

How did he know how I was feeling?

“This… this is nice,” I said, my voice softer.

“I know. I love it here more than you’ll ever know.”

“Ever?”

“Yes, ever.”

He came even closer, cupping my face in his hand.

*Does he not remember we’re in public? Where does he think we are?*

Then, without warning, he bent down and pressed a soft, warm kiss to my forehead before looking into my eyes.

In that moment, I saw something glisten in his eyes, and I realized Chris was singing *Fix You*.

And then it hit me. A tiny tear streamed down my face. He wiped it away and pulled me into a tight hug.

His strong hands around me felt so warm. I was just about reaching his shoulders, and I could feel his heart pounding as intensely as mine. In that moment, I wanted to stay there forever- wrapped in this stranger’s arms. Away from the realities of life, away from the challenges I knew I’d have to face when I returned.

I could tell the concert was over when his grip around me loosened. We watched the fireworks together, hand in hand, and walked out together, still holding hands. As our friends caught up to us, we split and joined our respective groups, now walking as one.

The rush outside was unanticipated. Once we entered the crowd, I saw his eyes scanning for me. The moment he spotted me, he pushed people aside to rush toward me, helping me navigate through the crowd, always protecting me from being shoved around.

He held my hand tightly and told me not to let go. It took us 45 minutes to find a place where we could finally breathe. Our groups stopped by the roadside to catch our breath before we tackled the next round of navigating the crowd to the metro station.

Everyone was buzzing about how exhilarating the experience had been. Photos and videos were airdropped, and of course, we got teased. I just blushed, and he smiled, grabbing my hand again—this time, our friends erupted in loud teasing.

When we were ready to face the crowd again, we made our way to the metro station gates. The pushes grew more intense, but he was right behind me, his hand firmly in mine. I couldn’t wait for dinner with him. I had it all planned in my head—taking him to a rooftop spot, forgetting everything else, including how I’d explain abandoning my friends.

We were almost there when he released my hand and placed his hands on my shoulders from behind. We somehow made it inside the station, but I couldn’t see our friends anywhere.

“Let’s meet directly at the hotel. We’re all split up,” Nick’s message read.

His friends were nowhere to be seen either. We took the escalator up to the concourse and stood in line. I asked him where he lived, and he mentioned near BKC in Mumbai. I’m from Pune, so I mentally noted that meeting him wouldn’t be difficult, as if we were already in a relationship.

Then, he pointed out the obvious—we didn’t even know each other’s names yet.

“Maya,” I said.

“Sid,” he replied.

*“How am I going to find this guy on Instagram? Couldn’t he have a more unique name?”*  
*“Just ask for his full name, you idiot. You only gave him your first name,” my brain chimed in.*

  
“Sid what?” I asked, but just then, the crowd surged forward as the Metro arrived. Before I could process, I was swept away by the crowd and struggled to find Sid in the sea of people.  
When I finally spotted him through the metro window, he was scribbling something on the moon goggles.  
He was *outside* the train. OUTSIDE THE TRAIN.  
I pushed through the crowd in the opposite direction, barely managing to reach the gates when I heard the “tan tan tan”—the doors closing warning.  
He slid the moon goggles through the sliding doors just in time.  
And off went the train. I saw him wave goodbye, and it felt like a wave of sorrow was pulling me in, deeper into the ocean. I didn’t know if I’d ever see him again. I didn’t even know his full name. I didn’t know what he did or how old he was. All I knew was that I had to talk to him again. I needed to feel his arms around me again. I needed his warm breath on my forehead again. I was on the verge of crying. This couldn’t be the end of our story. I nearly panicked.  
And then, suddenly, I realized I had his moon goggles in my hand.  
*“I never believed in keepsakes until I realized this was it. So, Maya, every time you think of me, look through these at the hearts. Know that there is a heart out there that you stole the biggest chunk of. Thanks, M, for these 4 hours! You will be a part of my story forever.*

*-Sid M..”*

  
Is that it? Could he only write this much? I mean, it was all within a minute but he could’ve given me his full name! What’s the deal with “M”? Two more seconds, and he could have finished it. *Two. More. Seconds.*

  
Restless, I turned the goggles over in my hand and took a deep breath. I kept reading the message over and over again, hoping for some kind of clue to emerge.

I couldn't shake the thought of him. I spent the night searching for every “Sid M” I could find on Instagram and LinkedIn, hoping to stumble across the right one. When I finally did fall asleep, it was like the search never ended.

The next day, it was time to head back to Pune. We boarded our train. I was happy—happy that I had witnessed the phenomenon that is Coldplay, happy that I met Sid M, and happy for the memories I now held. Though I missed him, I was ready to return to my normal life. I knew not all stories wrap up neatly and immediately. If Sid is meant to be, the Universe will find a way. Mumbai isn’t too far from Pune, after all. Until then, all Coldplay songs would remind me of him, and I would forever cherish the concert, the vibe, my friends, the fireworks, and—mostly—Sid.",3

One of my favorite paintings is of 2 emperor penguins standing next to each other with the negative space between them forming a heart.  The contrast of colors has often been what thrilled me the most.  The mixture of black, white, and smattering of yellow/red when contrasted with the light blue/white background is exciting to me.  I’ve always found penguins to be fascinating creatures.  They can stand still and look so regal.  They can waddle and bring a smile to your face with their awkwardness.  Once in the water, they look incredibly swift, quick, and fierce.  They mate for life and have beautifully cute babies.  When my mother talked about how Aurora does volunteer work at the zoo and loves to feed the penguins, I started formulating my plan.  I was looking for a space that she would be comfortable in but I wanted to share something of myself as well.  Here’s what happened:

The day of the date was peaceful.  Mary had asked to meet with Liam alone and I wanted to get home and get ready so I was happy when Aurora agreed that we’d just wait until 5:30 when I got to her house to pick her up.  My sisters were excited to be our drivers and my Mom made sure that my cloths were clean and pressed (I did try to argue that I can take care of myself but just accepted that she’s awesome). 

I find that wealth intimidates me.  I know it’s weird and I’ve only experienced it a few times but I definitely feel anxious when going into a fancy place.  It just feels like I don’t belong.  I remember having this feeling for the first time when I went to a teammates house on his invitation.  His family was welcoming, but I just felt “on edge”.  I didn’t want to touch anything, I was guarded with my words, and just ended up acting shy or even aloof.  When thinking back about it, I realized that it was my own insecurities that caused my behavior. 

To me, from my experiences, a home’s general state is one of chaos and interaction.  Walking into a home that is calm, quiet and peaceful just felt weird to me.  Seeing a kitchen that is as large as my apartment was unsettling.  To this day I have no clue how many people were in that house.  I know he has 3 siblings but didn’t see any of them.  His mom met us in the kitchen and offered us a snack.  His dad waved a hi from down a hall.  We went downstairs to a room with a leather couch, gaming system, and massive television.  We played some games, but I never felt comfortable.  I didn’t stay long and made an excuse to get away because I didn’t want to feel worried about saying something wrong or touching something I shouldn’t or acting different than expectations.

That’s how I felt when pulling up to Aurora’s house.  It looked like some sort of stone castle with gates in front that were open when we got there.  We drove up the driveway and Brenda parked her SUV at the walkway to the front door.  I could tell that my sisters were uncomfortable even though they had an idea of the area Aurora lived in.  My hands were shaking and sweaty.  I wanted to tell my sisters to head back home, not because I was worried about the date, but because I was intimidated.  I took a deep breath and was starting to count to 10 when my sister Bailey looked back and said, “Go get your girl Ben”, with a big smile.  I don’t know why, but it was the perfect thing to say at the perfect time.  I calmed down immediately and went to the front door to ring the bell. 

I didn’t expect to be greeted by a young girl, and she caught me by surprise when she welcomed me.  She looked like a mini version of Aurora while holding her hand straight out at me.  Aurora’s dad quickly approached as I was trying to understand what was happening.  He shook my hand and we walked into his entranceway.  I really don’t remember much other than talking about a signed Mike Trout jersey that he had framed on the wall.  That’s when she came down the stairs.

She glided down the stairs, stopped for a second to say bye to her dad and floated by me like those Russian ballet dancers that move like dolls.  I don’t know if this is a common thing or not, but my whole body just felt rigid as she walked by me.  Like I was stuck in that moment in time.  I’m sorry that I lack the words to describe her beauty other than to describe it as a sunrise on a calm day overlooking the ocean.  It was the smell of her perfume that jolted me out of it.  I followed her out the door and straight to my sister’s SUV. 

She abruptly stopped and turned around when she got to the end of the walkway, like she had forgotten something.  She was looking down at my feet when I caught up and whispered, “Sorry” to me.  I thought it was very cute and so very like her.  I just said, “Please let me get the door”, as I slid by her to the vehicle. I opened it for her, and she actually looked at me with a big smile as she got in.  I introduced my sisters from the door and they both said in unison, “Hi Aurora, thank you for putting up with our brother Ben”.  I quickly walked around to the other side and settled in beside her.

It was a quiet drive to the zoo.  I’d talked to my sisters about it, and they had promised to not bombard Aurora with questions and to keep the music down.  I was nervous as hell, and it looked like she was as well.  She was looking down at her hands and rubbing them together.  That’s when I asked, “Do you want to know where we are going?”.  She startled when I said it, then took a breath and looked at me to say, “If you want but I trust you.”.  I chose to tell her simply because I couldn’t hold it in anymore.  Her reaction was incredible.  She broke out in a laugh and flapped her arms while doing it.  It’s the first time I’d seen true happiness from her, and it can only be described as extravagant.  She was hopping in her seat, and I think the seatbelt is all that kept her from hitting her head on the roof.  It made me sooo happy!  Seeing her excited just filled me up with joy.  She was so free in the moment rather than her usual composed self.

I’d only been to the zoo once before.  It was a school trip when I was 11.  It’s awesome seeing animals but really it ended up being more about running around, looking at “cool” animals, and getting ice cream.  It wasn’t what I had planned for Aurora.  We wouldn’t be walking through the whole area, that would take a day, not a few hours.  Instead, we were just going to the penguin building because our zoo is incredible.  I didn’t know that buildings could be booked for special occasions.  I didn’t know that there were event rooms in these buildings, and I don’t think Aurora did either.

The plan was simple but perfect in my opinion.  We’d go to the penguins, eat while watching them, and then we would paint together.  She grabbed my hand as soon as I opened the door for her.  It was like I was a toy that she wanted to show off to her friends.  My sisters didn’t say anything, they knew their responsibilities.  She took me straight to the penguin complex, she walked fast, didn’t look back and held my hand the whole way.  Her determination was next level and behavior was on point.  Pretty fantastic to see though.  LOL.

The penguin area had 2 public viewing options.  You could go low where you can see the penguins swimming in the water from behind a glass.  They’re shaped like torpedo’s and are just plain speed and agility when in their element.  Or you can go to the high viewing area where you see them waddle on land, trip, honk, and just be comedians honestly.  The dichotomy is obvious but still incredible to see.  Aurora took me to the higher viewing area.  There were at least 40 penguins in the complex and she could tell me the name of every one of them.  I was standing beside this model as she held my hand and pointed out everything she loved about where I had taken her.  Think about that for a second.  Tell me you have a better start to a date with an angel?

I picked up on maybe half of the names because she was pointing and talking so fast.  Not because I was uninterested.  Distracted in the moment a bit, maybe, but definitely interested.  I confirmed some of the penguin names, commented on how handsome, cool, smart, or athletic some looked, and she loved every moment of the talk.  I then asked if she wanted to grab a bite.  That’s when we went to the event room.  Aurora’s parents had mentioned that it is available for no charge for her because it wasn’t booked this night and “everyone at the zoo loves Aurora”.  I don’t know if that is the truth, but I do know that the staff were very friendly with her, and it was clear that they cared for each other.  This was truly my one real worry about the date.  I’m a teenager trying to impress a goddess, but I didn’t want to end up enslaved in my attempt.  I was on guard for “extra costs” or “hidden charges”, non ever emerged and one of my few regrets is the time I spent worrying about it.

The event room was off to the side of the penguin paddock rather than the straight on view that the public got.  It had 2 levels, but you were way closer to what the penguins were doing.  We came in on the top level and there was an area where you could walk onto the land area with the penguins and engage them directly.  A staff member was there to guide us but Aurora was aware of the rules and trusted, so she was able to lead me directly into the space (she did look a little surprised that it was there though, I think she fed them from a different entry space).  She introduced me to a couple of them.  Romeo, yeah apparently, he’s always the first to approach the ladies, and Sally, she just happened to be near us, were fascinating.  I don’t know how I’ll ever forget the moment where Aurora was crouched down, Romeo at her hand and Sally walking towards her hip.  It just looked like a fantasy movie.

We then went to the lower area to eat.  My sisters had the job of grabbing our food and taking it down to the picnic tables.  Brenda was the one that told us the food was ready while we were playing with Romeo and Sally.  We had a picnic table where we could sit side by side while watching the penguins swim.  Aurora’s favorite meal is chicken fingers and fries.  No dip, no garnish.  Just the Zoo cafeteria chicken fingers and fries.  She actually hates the school cafeteria chicken fingers.  That’s why I never had a clue that this would be her favorite.  I thought the fries we were eating together when we met were just a “cheap” snack to help us bond but apparently fries are one of her favorite things in life and the school lunch lady lacks the ability to bread and fry a chicken strip appropriately for her.    

It's a mind noodle to think about it and I was totally stretched on the thought.  Here’s a very well-off model princess with an addiction to fried chicken fingers and potatoes.  I don’t know how much more I could fall for her.  I wasn’t eating chicken fingers though.  That wasn’t happening.  Chicken has been part of my life way too much.  I truly wish it would go away.  I wanted a burger.  Something with sauces and accompaniments that were fresh and crunchy.  I took the risk of a sauce spill and had a burger while she ate her fingers and fries while pointing at the penguins whipping by our spot.

We sat eating while watching these rocket fast penguins fly by us.  Aurora wasn’t fixated on me, or the moment.  She was stuck on the penguins.  It’s fine, I expected that.  I started asking her about her favorites and if she had any pictures.  She pulled her phone out and showed me some.  I focused on the angles and colors in the pictures.  I could tell that she had a good eye for capturing profiles.  I asked if she had ever tried painting before and she said no.  I then asked, “Would you like to try right now?”.  She looked confused as she responded, “We can’t paint here.”.  I smiled and asked her to come upstairs.  My sisters and the zoo staff had set up an area overlooking the enclosure.  There was a mat on the ground, a couple of easels and a table with my watercolor paints.  There was even a couple of smocks so that we didn’t get our clothes dirty.

I looked at her and said, “Painting is one of my favourite things.  Would you be ok painting with me?”.  I could tell that she was scared.  She was looking downward, glancing here and there like she was struggling to find something to focus on.  I knew that it wasn’t the time for me to push her or anything like that.  I just walked over to the easel’s and set them up a few feet from each other.  I then said, “Please just come over and try when you feel ready.”.  I grabbed a black pencil and drew the outline of a smaller penguin that was standing still near the water.  I then pointed at it and asked, “What’s that one’s name?”.  She looked down at it and said, “That’s Leo because he’s so handsome.”.  I laughed and said, “That’s awesome, I’ve drawn his profile here if you’d like to try painting him.”.  I then moved to my easel and started my picture.  I knew the picture I wanted to draw.

She needed some time to collect herself.  She would look at Leo and then the sketch, and then me.  She’d then rub her hands together and look at them.  I knew the moment she had decided to join me.  She stood up tall, head held high and walked over to her easel right beside me.  I helped her put on her frock, I showed her quickly how to dip her brush into the water and the paint and said, “I’m here to help, but this is your painting.  Do what ever you feel like with it.  There is no right or wrong when it comes to this stuff.”.  She asked for help getting her colors darker but was otherwise comfortable, even excited sometimes.  I found myself staring at her.  Her concentration was amazing to watch.

Before we knew it, our time was done.  I’m not going to say that the paintings were fantastic works of art or anything like that.  I was impressed by her use of color for the water, it looked excellent.  She left Leo as I had drawn with just negative space while focusing on his background.  My picture was as you would expect, 2 of the penguins leaning into each other, leaving a heart shape between them. 

It was Brenda that came to us to give us a 15-minute warning.  Enough time for us to look at each other’s creations and clean up.  I could tell that Aurora was frustrated with having to stop, her chin started to scrunch up a bit, but she relaxed when I said, “Paintings are always a work in progress, this is just the start of ours.  We’ll do some more next time, Okay?”.  She nodded, smiled, and pointed at my painting while asking, “Which penguins were you drawing?”.  I pointed at the 2 that I had used as my initial sketch. She was glowing a bit when she said, “Their names are Ross and Rachel, but I wish they were Ben and Aurora.”.  My heart leapt at that moment, and I knew that she’d grabbed it with both hands.

I’d bought a satchel for her to carry her painting in (I had an old one for me).  It had straps so that you could wear it like a backpack.  She loved the gift and hugged me when I showed her how it worked.  It was a quick reflexive hug that she immediately backed off from, but it was a moment for me.  Her hair wisped across my nose and her scent invaded my nostrils like a sea breeze.  It was incredible.

The ride home was quiet, she kept the satchel on her lap and was staring down at it like she was trying to envision the painting inside.  She waited for me to open the SUV door when we got to her house.  She said, “Thank you for driving and taking care of me, it was so nice to meet you both.”, to my sisters.  They were chirping nice responses to her as I helped Aurora get out with her painting.  She held it by her side as we walked to her door.  Her pace was much slower than when we came out.  She almost had a jump in her step rather than a glide.  When we got to the door, she turned to me and asked, “Can we do this again soon?  I had a great time and would like to paint some more with you.”.  I replied, “Of course, I took pictures of Leo, Ben and Aurora for us to use when we get a chance.”, with a big smile.  She started to say, “Ross and….”, then she caught on and smiled back.  That’s when it happened.  I could see her lean in, and I asked, “May I kiss you goodnight?”.  She closed her eyes and said, “Yes, please.”.

I was careful to not pull her to me, I knew that would be a mistake.  I tilted my head a bit and pressed my lips to hers.  I’ll keep the feeling and taste to myself, but it was magical for me.  She twirled, said, “I’ll text you tomorrow, goodnight.”, and she was gone into the house.  I’m pretty sure I heard some faint, “Woohoo’s!”, coming from inside.  I turned and skipped my way to my sisters and allowed myself to smile and play coy with them as they were interrogating me on the way home.

So, there it is.  The most fabulous, romantic, thrilling evening of my life so far.  I’m not going to be able to sleep tonight.  My heart is aching, my mind is spinning, and my body is shaking.  Adrenaline is coursing through my veins, and I don’t want it to stop. 

I find myself thinking about how this can all work.  I find her fascinating, but I also realize that there are complications that are present or yet to be revealed.  Personally, I feel a connection to her that I haven’t felt before and is more than just physical attraction.  I’m staring at my painting right now and I like the lines and colors that I chose.  They just look softer and more purposeful than my usual work.  I think that is partly from the calm that I feel when she’s near me.  All I can do is continue to see where this all goes from here.

Thank you for reading my story. ",13
1egjw5m,1722422197.0,2024-07-31 10:36:37,stories,The Worst Heartbreak I've Ever Experienced,"Hello Reddit, long time lurker, first time poster. For the sake of everyone involved, I will keep this as nameless as possible. I wrote this months ago around February, but decided to share it now because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a new ""relationship"" (quotes because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] too sure of what it means just yet) and I've been finding it a bit difficult to move past what happened in my previous one. It might help move some healing forward. Apologies in advance, but this is going to be a bit of a loooong once. Please find the TLDR at the very end.

In 2022, I had met someone who I believed to be amazing and potentially the love of my life. We matched on Tinder and we went on our first date. He (23m at the time now) was from South America, and he had moved to my (24f at the time) home country here in Africa (don’t want to specify countries as they are a bit unique). During this first date, we spent 17 hours together, talking, laughing, getting deep, and really seeing each other. I thought I had met someone different and wonderful.

A couple weeks later of a few more dates, he asks me to be his girlfriend, which I say yes to. He is the first person in a very long time who made me feel special and happy. He was consistent and very loving. When discussing when our anniversary should be (either our first date or when he asked me to be his girlfriend), he said it should be our first date as that was the day he had fallen in love with me. As our bond started getting stronger, he made claims of wanting to marry me, saying he cannot live without my love anymore, that I have shown him what real unconditional love is, so on and so forth. You get the picture.

He said that he had never had stability in his life, and I was showing him through myself and my love for him what he needs. He said that no one in his life ever showed him what this means. I showed him through my friendships (who also became friends with him because he was great at that time), my siblings, my parents, everyone around me, what real love is. The way I was so genuine made him feel like good people like me really do exist.

Months pass and we are happily in love, communication is amazing, our bedroom life is amazing, and our time together was always fun. He wrote me love letters, always got me flowers, going out on dates, etc. So, I thought we were good. Since he had always said he wanted to marry me, I told him then lets make a five year plan. We are both in our twenties and experiencing the work force for the first time, so lets be serious if he wants to be. I told him, if he isn’t ready for that, that was okay, but to talk about it. He said nothing different. There were courses he wanted to take to help him with his job, I researched and came up with lists for him. I found countries we could move to with both of our passports and made Pinterest boards for what our house could look like.

A few more months pass, and a few things start to change. I started falling to a dark place, but ignored it for so long that it hit harder than I expected. I talked with him about it, and he encouraged me to speak with friends and family. I have undergone about 4-5 years of therapy as a teen due to other reasons, so I had a number of healthy coping mechanisms as well as an understanding of how to get myself out of a situation like this. Never applied any pressure on him to be the person to take on everything.

But during this time, I had a few break downs and sometimes friends weren’t available. When that happens, I try to call him, because I don’t want to call him every time something happens, he is usually my second-to-last or last resort. He would say he would give me a call in 5 min, but just wouldn’t call back at all, or if he did, he was drunk/too stoned to think. Sometimes he wouldn’t answer all day. I never wanted him to come rushing to me to take care of me, just answering the phone to say “hey, you’re okay” and to let me vent a bit. The first time it happened, I thought okay, it happens, and I told him that if he couldn’t get back to me, it was okay, to just tell me he couldn’t speak right now. He told me okay, and that it wouldn’t happen again. Then it happened a second time. I again told him, if you’re not going to do something, just don’t tell me you’ll do it, it’s better to not speak than to give empty promises. I’m not the type of person to get bothered by things like this, but more importantly, I really don’t like when someone promises to do something and they don’t follow up.

Then, it happened for the third time. I put my foot down and gave him an out. I have been there for him for some horrible moments he has experienced in our year together, so I don’t think I was stupid to expect that back from him. Especially since he claimed that we were each other’s best friends. Essentially, I told him if he doesn’t want to be with me any longer after seeing this side of me, then he can tell me honestly and we can move from there. I told him that if he cannot be there for me, then to tell me now and to not make me feel like I have to beg to get him to speak to me.

I never needed partnership to survive. I was without him this long; I can continue to be without him if necessary. It’s harsh, but I know myself, and I refuse to make myself the bad guy because I’m having some nights where I need a bit of extra comfort. Especially, since that’s what we both said we were here to do for each other. I had always told him there was space for honesty, asking him if he still wanted to be with me (even outside the time I put my foot down), telling him it’s okay, we can slow down, etc. He never said anything different.

I finally started really getting out of the dark place and started doing things to improve my mental health, work life, and physical health. I started working out more, started seeing some friends more, and I told him he was more than welcome to join me on any of these things. He had been wanting to work out for a long time and I offered him to join me, yet he refused. He said he was too tired or too lazy, which was fine. That’s his prerogative, but it wouldn’t stop me. He always supported me, making sure I was doing all that. 

A month after this, in October 2023, I got very ill. I had a chest infection that lasted a few days and I could hardly speak or move out of bed. He was on a work trip a couple hours away from the main city (this was normal for the entirety of our relationship), and he called and texted frequently to see if I was okay. Telling me that when we see each other on Friday, he would take care of me.

Friday comes around, and I feel a lot better. My antibiotics were working really well and I was able to speak more than a few sentences without a hacking fit. But he didn’t answer any of my texts from the night before or the morning (he always consistently sent I love you’s, good nights, and Good Morning’s every day). I ask him if I did anything wrong, and that he could talk to me about anything always. Then he says this:

“Hey, it isn't that you did something, its just I have been feeling weird and I don't know how to talk about it with you.

I don't want you to stress over the weekend or anything like that about what this is...Do you think we can see eachother on Sunday to get together and talk things out? I miss you too but I need some time and space to think about how I am [REDACTED_NAME].

Im sorry for being so distant while you were sick and in general, its my fault not yours that we haven't been talking much.

I hope you can understand and we can talk about it on Sunday

Love you”

So, now I’m panicking. I didn’t feel him being distant, because he was calling me and saying “I love you” etc the entire time. There was no distance at all from what I know of. Immediately I knew he wanted to break up with me. But why? I had no idea, up until then, he was as consistent as he was from the very beginning of our relationship. I waited patiently till Sunday. I didn’t call, I didn’t text. I gave him his space to figure it out, except for once asking what time and where to meet on Sunday.

Sunday comes (this is the last week of October), and he breaks up with me, both of us crying at the cafe. Hard. Him harder than me. I won’t write everything but here are the major points:

1.     We both are not financially stable, if he has to move from the country and I move with him, he can’t support me, and he’s worried that would break our relationship.

2.     He still lives with his dad here in my country and he can’t see a life where the three of us have to live in a house together because of how much he depends on his dad currently.

3.     He has a lot of issues he needs to deal with himself, I have showed him so much love and care that he needs to give to himself, and wants to do just that.

4.     He didn’t want to drag me down in the process of him making himself better.

5.     He said in verbatim: “This isn’t about other women, I want to focus on myself, and become the type of man you deserve to be with.”

So, I let it happen. I was devastated, the most heartbroken I have ever been in my life. But I told him how strong he must be to tell me all of this, that he was so honest and kind. I felt even more heartbroken for him than for myself. We agreed that in a few weeks’ time I would go to pick up my stuff. I was whiplashed and confused for those next two weeks. Diving into straight work, going to the gym, meeting with friends, anything to distract me from the pain that I felt waking up every day.

Finally, I went to go pick up my stuff (this is mid-November). This falls on the day of our one-year anniversary. We finish packing my stuff, laugh, talk, and think about all the good times we had. Obviously still being sad. We ended up getting intimate, but I’m not a fool. I wanted to do this one last time so we would have one beautiful last night together of kissing and cuddling. I knew I needed to do it one last time, so it could be our last time ever. Once we finished, he turned and asked me what time I was going home. Confused, I said I thought I was spending the night. He then says he thought that since he has to work the next day and so do I, that I would go home. I was hurt, deeply. I didn’t understand how he thought this was how our last night was going to be like. We always spent the night together, this shouldn’t be any different, as it was literally our last night. I started crying, and the tears wouldn’t stop. I tried everything I could to calm down, but I just couldn’t stop crying. He felt bad and asked if we can have the last night another night, in two weeks time, I tell him I cannot prolong this heart break, it already hurt so much waiting two weeks to see him, I can’t wait another two weeks for another heart-breaking moment. I already was having chest pains. He then says I should spend the night, that I can’t go home crying this hard. He said that he wanted us to be friends, and that we should figure out a way for us to stay in each other’s lives, without it being too hard on both of us. I agreed, and the best way to do this was to not be intimate, to not act like a couple, and to be genuine friends to one another. He said he would do all that, because he couldn’t not have me in his life. He said let’s meet in two weeks. I said okay.

So, we wake up the next day, he goes to work, I call a cab and place all my stuff in the car and go home to get ready for work. I felt heartbroken all over again, taking all my stuff back meant that it really was over, and that this relationship was done. For the next couple of months, I woke up with even more immense chest pains, specifically on my left side (which I now realise was pain from heart break), and I couldn’t eat properly, I gym regularly (mainly weightlifting) and I kept losing weight. I was feeling nauseous, and I began to isolate, stopped going out to meet people (unless it was this small bar that is across the street from my apartment). But I held all of this to myself, and I told everyone around me that I was okay, and that I felt worse for him because he had to make such a difficult decision. That it takes a man to be able to let someone you love so much go.

A month goes by, I was still heart broken, still confused. I was still holding my feelings, because I was imagining how much of a hard time he was going through. However, I had reached out as we were meant to meet two weeks after I had taken all my stuff back (and, admittedly I had left two things in his freezer I couldn’t take at the time, so I wanted to use those as an excuse to see him again), asking if he was ready to have a friend dinner, and just to catch up. He took a day to respond (understandable). This is his text:

“Hey, hope you are doing well too :)

And yeah I was hesitant because of time passing by and all...

I do want to see you, but I don't know how ready I am [REDACTED_NAME] us to go out as friends yet, not because I don't want to but because I still have feelings for you and need a bit more time, I hope you are ok with this because I would like to see you sometime soon”

I understood, as I still had feelings for him too. But I responded with:

“hey, i understand, its okay

take as much time as you need and when you're ready we can hang out :) 

next time please dont hesitate to reach out though, you're allowed to be honest about how you feel and what you're ready for and we'll work through it whenever that time comes.

i hope you have a good rest of your week”

And he didn’t respond after that. It was radio silence, and I was still dealing with this heart break and the chest pains. More than anything, I was still imagining how heartbroken he must be. Two lovers who cannot continue because of circumstances. Devastating.

A few more weeks go by, and he sends me this message out of the blue: 

“Hey \[OP\], hope things have been well and life isn't too crazy lately

I have not known how to text you given that things are as they are now between us, not meaning anything bad, but distant for sure, mainly because of me... 

I have come to realize I really need to still focus on my personal growth and how it has taken a lot of energy from me, mentally and physically, to start straightening my life once again, but more. This past time without you has been crazy difficult and lonely, I miss you and us just existing and enjoying eachother. I really do. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] grateful and happy for the time we spent together, but I feel like we have to let eachother go, I don't want you waiting for me to be better, it just doesn't seem fair to you at all.

I just want you to know that, I have never been loved so well, that I thank you for all the good and bad times were we held eachother up. I will never forget what it means to love someone and be loved unconditionally.

Much love always, \[His Name\].

Also, I still have your salmon and shrimp at the house, dunno if they are still good but they are still frozen for sure. If you ever want to pick them up or something let me know so you can have them.

Felt like you didn't want to ask for it...”

I almost fell to my knees. I wanted to scream cry into the wind. As I cried, I asked him if I could take a few more days to write a response. I was so heartbroken; I couldn’t even have him in my life as a friend. Letting him go completely meant shutting the door of a potential future together. I can never see him again, or see how he’s doing, or anything. It was truly, really over. The pain was too much to bear. Even more painful for him, to think that it wasn’t fair on me to make me wait. I collected myself over the next few days and wrote this response:

“hey hey, i’m sorry it took me a while to respond. when i first got your message i honestly didn’t know what to do with myself or how to respond. i wanted the initial shock to clear away first before i wrote back.

life has been quite crazy for me actually (both good and bad), but i hope you’re doing well too and life isn’t as crazy for you

i’m really happy to hear that you are working hard to get your life straightened out, and i want you to know you will always have my full support in everything that you do, especially this, even if i can’t be there to see it. this is an incredibly difficult journey for anyone, and i’m so proud of you for taking this bull by the horns. i still believe 100% that you deserve to get to a place where you are proud of what it took to get you there. you are a wonderful soul who deserves to let the universe inside you grow in all ways possible

this past time without you has also been incredibly painful and lonely for me, and i'm [REDACTED_NAME] gonna lie, it’s been the most difficult thing i have experienced/still experiencing in almost a decade. i never dreamed of meeting someone like you so early on in my life, and the hardest part is having to not only lose you as a partner, but as my best friend too. i don’t want to, but for the sake of growth, i guess we can let each other go. this is going to be the second most difficult thing for me to do.

i will never forget everything you’ve done for me, our time together, and how amazing you have been throughout. thank you for being you and allowing me to experience us in the best way possible. you allowed me to see and to experience what it means to really let myself love and be loved unconditionally and wholeheartedly. i hope you always remember your worth and how much you deserve to be loved and cared for the way i have done for you

much love always, \[OP\]

as for the salmon and shrimp, you can keep it, it’s too painful for me to come and get it. i hope that’s okay and that you understand why.”

And that was that. I cried nonstop after I sent that, it felt like I couldn’t breathe. I was in whirlwind of emotions. How hard of a decision was this to make for him was what calmed me down mostly, and made me control my emotions. That I had to be strong for me and for him. But a day or two later, I was on Facebook, and noticed that his father was posting pictures from a different country in Africa that he was visiting. Confused, I immediately logged back into my Instagram (I had deleted my social media apps a month before our break up). I see his story, and he is also in that country. I begin to think “did he send me that message so he can travel guilt free?” but I kept talking myself out of feeling that way. Thinking that this is just my anxiety and heartbreak. That’s not fair of me to think like that, he deserves to be happy and go on holiday. Just because I threw myself into my job and gym, doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be enjoying life. Especially because it was New Years. 

As a few more weeks passed, I start to check his story every once in a while, just to see how he is doing. One day, I’m on there and saw he had removed the picture of us together. I understood. But when I went to his following list, I saw that he had unfollowed me (but still allowed me to follow him), I was confused as I was still not officially back on social media except for the occasional checking on him once/twice a week, so I scroll down the list to see if he had unfollowed anyone else.

A bit of back story for context: As I said, we had met on Tinder. He had also matched with another girl I knew before we dated (my city is very small, everyone knows someone somehow). He had unfollowed her and removed her from his follower list when we became official, stating that he didn’t need to follow her anymore (he said he does this when he doesn’t feel like following a person anymore). Cool. Back to the story.

I see that he had refollowed her and accepted her follow request, meaning that he had gone back on Tinder to find her username. So, it meant he was back on there, mainly because after a year of us being together, there was no way he would have memorized her username. I scroll further and see a few more women that I know were on Tinder and they were following each other. I became a bit enraged, but kept my cool as I thought he’s single, he can do what he wants. I couldn’t see his stories anymore, which I thought came from him unfollowing me.

The following days, checking his following list, I noticed he unfollowed two of my best friends, but continued to follow everyone else I introduced him to (including two of my other really close friends, my brothers who are very close to me, etc.). I told my best friends this, and we were confused. We had a sleep over and spent a bit of time trying to figure out more, and then I noticed that he had posted a story that day. I asked them if he had been posting regularly, and they said yes. Meaning he had blocked only me off his story. I was really confused by this because all he posts are plants, the sky, the occasional office shot, and music. There was nothing to hide.

A couple more days go by, and I call a very good friend of mine to vent. He listens at first, but cuts me off halfway, saying he needed to tell me something, but to meet him in person. I agree and we meet up for coffee the following week.

He asks how I am [REDACTED_NAME], the process I’ve been going through, (this friend of mine is like my life guru and I value him very highly, he’s been my friend for almost ten years, my oldest friend honestly). I explain everything and when I finish, he asks if I am [REDACTED_NAME] to hear what he has to say, I nod and he begins to tell me.

I won’t get into the details as this is my friend’s private business, but essentially, a few months before this, he told me that a woman he knows gave him access to her Tinder and as he was scrolling (very far down the interaction list I might add), he saw my ex’s name pop-up. By sheer luck, this information was in my friend’s hands now. Curious, for my sake of course, he opens it and sees that my ex had been having this exchange with this woman since September. A whole month before he broke up with me. The last messages being in November, two to three “Hey’s” which she didn’t respond to. My friend at the time didn’t say anything, at the time, as he wanted to make sure I was really in a good place to hear this information. Specifically, at a place where I was getting ready to let my ex go, so that this could be the final push.

As he told me, I felt everything around me crumble. I have been cheated on in my past and my ex knows this. He has also been cheated on. Whenever he needed reassurance, I would give it to him and vice-versa. In the past, we have had a lengthy discussion on trust, cheating, lying, and everything in between. Like I said, we had a very open communication relationship. I told him, that personally, I believe cheating is a hateful act, because when you cheat, it means you do not care about your partner at all, and you are placing your selfish needs over having an honest conversation that could save your partner from pain and betrayal. I strongly believe no one belongs to anyone, that everyone is free to do what they want, as long as they are honest about it and want to own up to their actions. If anything, the person owes it to the other to honestly say they want to step out, so the other person has every right to react to the truth. But he didn’t do that. He just lied. Over, and over, and over again. He might have lied to “spare my feelings” but I was putting his feelings ahead of my own, because I believed he made a hard decision. The real decision he made was that he wanted to explore his options, and get rid of me in the process. Instead of letting me have those true feelings, he lied to make himself look like the hero.

Now, I’m not going to say anything except that this is only one woman’s story that I know of (she doesn’t know me, and I don’t know her), but from the other context clues, the only reasonable thing I can think of is that he was getting ready to cheat on me (if he didn’t already), but either by just wanting to get me out of the way, or by guilt, he finally broke up with me. I don’t know when he got back on Tinder, if it was before he talked to this woman or if it started with her, but I knew his phone password, and used his Instagram to look things up to show him while I was off my Instagram, but I never went through his phone. I trusted him. He had his finger print on my phone, so it was mutual. I would never in a million years have guessed that he was capable of this, especially because as I wrote previously, he was consistent, up until the day he broke up with me. He knew my feelings about cheating, he knew that I believed it was a hateful act. 

I don’t really understand any of it, and I was hoping Reddit could help me see this clearer or try to get me to understand what is going on. Writing it out made me feel better in some way. I’m not sure how I didn’t see the signs, as I thought I was great at spotting them. I don’t think I could have though, unless I went through his phone, which I believe is the end of any relationship. You don’t invade someone’s privacy like that, because it means there is no trust, and with no trust, there is no relationship

At this stage, I don’t want to confront him, as I don’t think anything could come out of it. He lied straight to my face several times for weeks. It’s not like there was anything we lacked, we were intimate 4-5 times a week, he always wanted me to come over, I was careful of his space, asking if he was sure and he always said “of course, you’re my girlfriend, just come over”. Always saying I love you, always telling me how much he cared for me, how much he respected me. I’m not sure about anything tbh. What I’m sure of though, is that this has really damaged me, and has made me rethink about what trust means to me. The only thing I would like to do is get my nudes off his phone. We had recorded a few tapes as well, I want them off his phone. I don’t want him using my body again for his own self pleasure. I get so sick thinking of him using my pictures and our videos after all the lies he has told me.

How can someone claim to love me so much that they cannot imagine their lives without me, yet be stepping out of the relationship? His last few messages to me made me think he truly loved me. Maybe he did at some point, but definitely not towards the end. I feel sick when I think about the last night we spent together. It makes me think that he actually did want me to go home, like he just wanted to use me one last time, but felt guilty when I was crying. It makes me feel used, like I was just another body to him. Like the year we spent together meant nothing to him, especially on the night of what would have been our one-year anniversary.

My friend who had revealed my ex’s Tinder use, told me this: “People who haven't done the inner work are always going to present a risk to people who trust them. I genuinely believe you gave amazing things to someone who wasn't ready for them, or didn't understand how to handle them with care. This doesn't decrease with age. It decreases with maturity, and people in their early twenties are horrible at boundaries and maturity.” Which helped me think about it a lot.

So, people of Reddit, that’s my story. This has been the worst heartbreak I have ever experienced, and the amount of betrayal I feel is immense. I’m not sure how to conclude this. I’m still working and going to the gym and spending time with friends. My life hasn’t stopped, and the pain is less. I guess if I feel anything, it’s just disappointing. He is not the man I thought he was. All I can do is take the good and learn from the bad I guess. Thanks for reading.

TLDR; I was with someone for the past year who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, and I thought he wanted to spend the rest of his with me (as he told me several times he wanted to marry me and be with me forever). He broke up with me saying that he wanted to better himself and grow into a man who he believed deserves to be with me. A few months later, a friend revealed to me that he was on Tinder a month before he actually broke up with me. Now dealing with trying to move on.",9
1fuyyoa,1727927069.0,2024-10-03 03:44:29,stories,A Love Story for Reddit: Prologue and Chapter 1,"Prologue:
Do you enjoy reading any love story? I love my story. I’ve never been so self important to think that my story is better than anyone else’s. Ive learned that the unfortunate reality is that so many people do not get the luxury of experiencing lasting love. So what that leads me to do is tell my story. My hope is that if you’re reading this, maybe I can help you recognize it. 

Love is an experience. It’s one of few feelings that when you have felt it, you know its a good one. It’s only once you realize that you’re experiencing “love” that you have to make the decision: 
1. Do I pursue this? Do I try to recreate it and risk losing it?
2. Do I leave this be and assume that I’m romanticizing what it’s like to be loved?

I don’t have real numbers on this but I venture to guess that most of us choose option 2 99% of the time and I mean that. Opportunities to experience love are all around us. We desire romantic love above all most of the time. Well isn’t it the things we want most that we are most afraid of? Afraid of having, afraid of losing. If our experience in life has been that we do not get what we want, would we not take our opportunities for romantic love for granted most of all? We dream of getting a winning lottery ticket that takes all of our cares away, but if your perfect person was sitting across from you right now, would you be ready to meet them? Not just “would you be scared” but would you be ready to be what they needed while they tried to do the same for you or would you ask them to pull you forward while you changed into the person they need? Would you first have to go through the process of learning how to pursue them and ask them to wait for you while you do so? Pursuing what we want in life is our only option. If we don’t, or if we let up on our pursuit, our fears get the opportunity to catch up to us… and stab us right in the back. 

This is the story of how I fell in love with my wife, how lucky I was, and how my attraction and infatuation with her had nothing to do with where I am [REDACTED_NAME]. It will be entertaining and it’s adorable. Everyone loves hearing it and making me retell it to new audiences. Nonetheless, I would trade our story for a boring one if it meant that I could love her more today so I didn’t have to wait until tomorrow. 

Chapter 1: Stop Loving Me

I met her in the 4th grade. Don’t go counting your chickens before they hatch though. You cant guess how this story is going to go. For one, she and I have different accounts for how the 4th grade went. I remember having a quiet crush on her and being so involved in a small relationship with everyone in the room that I wasn’t really close with anyone but maybe one main best friend. Her account was that she and I were friends and part of a friend group and that I didn’t ever show any interest in her despite her crush on me. It doesn’t help my account that if you get her 4th grade yearbook (that she still has) out, you can find where I signed it with “Have a bad year.” “Bad” was crossed out and changed to “good” by her, clearly not in the same handwriting. 

In 3rd grade, I remember being new at that elementary school and didn’t know my future wife existed. Every boy in my class had a crush on the same girl, including me. She had a crush on one boy: me. Valentine’s Day rolled around and she brought me chocolates in a heart shaped box. It was sitting on my desk. She was wearing a Navy Blue matching jacket and pants and had gotten to school early to make sure to put those chocolates on my desk before I got there. When I saw them, I was surprised. I flipped them over to see who they were from. They were from the girl I wanted to want me. She did and now everyone knows it. I was the only one with chocolates on their desk. The secret is out now. So now there’s only one thing left to do: throw them in the trash in front of everyone. So I did. She immediately went to the teacher and got a hall pass. She left the room. Everyone was looking at me while I was looking out oblivious. The only thoughts in my mind were how I had just avoided telling a room full of people that I had a crush on a girl. One girl whispered to me, “You made her cry.” To my genuine surprise I responded back, “Was she? Why? Everyone likes her.”

Once I moved to the 4th grade I tried to convince myself that I would muster the courage to tell a girl I liked her if I ever knew she liked me. I had a crush on two girls in that class. One was the girl everyone seemed to have a crush on. She had a boyfriend (you know, because there was always one “it” couple despite us being 9 years old). So I made a deal with myself that if this girl ever expressed her feelings for me, I would do it right this time. The other girl was the one that was quiet and kept to herself. She was the one I wished silently to myself the teacher would ask to read aloud. She was the one I kept tabs on constantly despite her being intentionally under the radar. She was a straight A kid. You could tell that getting in trouble for talking in class mortified her. She was the golden child. She lit up when you gave her attention, but she always kept her distance when I was getting myself into trouble (which happened a lot in the 4th grade). She had the cutest face, large eyes, and a smile that beamed at you if you could ever get that shy face to spare one. 

It’s amazing the things you remember. Why is that? Well, love is an experience. We keep so many memories in our subconscious and are ready to tie them together with other things that happen in life in ways we previously hadn’t considered being able to. Maybe we remember a street name that later shows up on the news and suddenly we say “I’ve been there!” Love can solidify these same timelines in our mind and assist us in recalling the same info. We pay attention more when we are experiencing love. And of course we do, because that’s when it makes the most sense to. On the other hand, that doesn’t mean that we are unwilling to throw it away in favor of being able to step away from vulnerability. It doesn’t mean that we always recognize it. It certainly doesn’t mean that we never confuse it with something else. Love is still the constant, though. That’s why we must pursue it. That’s why it takes so much effort to hold onto. It’s not trying to get away, but its not normal to do everything it asks us to. Sometimes we let go of it because we don’t feel like we deserve it. We feel like it must have the wrong person. If love asks us to change into someone else, what if we don’t like that person? It’s funny, we are afraid to change into a person that better aligns with what we want, but we rarely flinch when allowing ourselves to become the embodiment of our fears. “What if I don’t like that me (the one I am [REDACTED_NAME] I love)?” Well, here’s a compromise: if you love you right now, don’t change. But if you aren’t satisfied with who you are, let the pursuit of love consume you before your fears convince you love can only heal you and that there is no life beyond it. 

I never mustered the courage to tell my future wife how I felt about her in the 4th grade, but 5th grade was my year. I for sure was going to tell a girl I liked her in the 5th grade. Ultimately I did (3 girls in fact). Unfortunately, the sweet quiet girl from the 4th grade wasn’t in my class this year. But, no biggie. I just needed to figure out which class she was in so I can see when I might run into her at school. I remember the phone list coming out the first week of school. When I got home I went through every class to find her teacher. She wasn’t there. She and I both had brothers that were friends in the same grade 2 years older. My brother and I weren’t very close and he was definitely not going to learn about the girl I had a crush on so I casually asked him if they had any classes together. He said, “no, their family moved.” My heart dropped, “Moved? Moved where? you never mentioned that.” He brushed it off, “ya, they moved 6 hours away. They’re gone.”

Your sitting at a fire with a what seems to be a young man,he seems to be around 20 years old but you know better he's much older then he let's on you have been traveling with him for a little bit now and yku never realized you don't know much about him so you decide to ask ""hey what's your story?""

Him ""what?""

""What's your story? I just realized I don't really know much besides that you have a horrible sense of humor"" 

""Oh humor me""

He gets a small laugh from you and you realized you fucked up and he says""looks like your humor is just a horrible as mine, that's funny""


""Anyways you want to know my story?





You nod

""I gotta warn you man it is extremely long and I may not finish it today or any day for a bit it's just that long"" 

You say"" yes I wanna h ar the whole thing"" 

""Ha okay  here goes nothing "" he says 


We switch to his POV 


It all started when I was around (..) at the time,

I was in highschool just living a good life with my two nerdy friends, I was a bit of a nerd myself but I was a nerd of fighting styles and I loved to learn all about it.

it was the beginning of the new school year and one day a new girl came I can't remember her name but she had blonde hair and blue eyes and a wild personality, me and her  quickly became friends because and her had a lot in common we both loved to fight but her way of fighting was using magic which I didn't even think was real at the time but seeing her use it opened a whole new world to me,

at some point we even dated for a little bit but we were better off as friends and I thought we were okay with just being friends.

after a year of being good friends I decided to get a girlfriend and as it turns out she didn't like it and what she did made me hate her very being, she burned down my house , killed my family and was trying to kill me too,I forget to mention but I was given these scissors thay can cut through reality and to a new dimension, anyways I ran to different dimensions untill i reached the final dimension I knew, it was at the end of the universe. 

i was deathly tired and i was not able to run,i realized i was going to have to fight,but soon realized I had no chance at winning so i was cornered near end of the universe, a black void and as i looked at her one last time she hits me with a spell causing a huge slash across my chest and i fall into the void screaming then nothing for what to be eternity.

suddenly  I wake up on a flower bed looking up to a whole in the cave roof, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] wearing your clothes but with a scar on my chest and my clothes destroyed, I was  younger then when i fell and i remember what happened,i was scared to move bit decided to get up and look around and i found a stick and decided to keep it for defence until i found a better weapon, 

I walked into a old hallway and then a monster in the darkness Comes out and looks at you, and I only seen them through the glowing eyes they had and I froze in fear feeling weaker then I already was but got ready to fight and it says"" a human?"" As it study's you and it begins to walk towards you and it comes into the light to reveal a tall goat monster wearing a purple dress with a strange symbol on the middle

""What are you"" I barely managed to say 

""Oh I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my child,my name is [REDACTED_NAME] and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] keeper of these ruins""

""Where am I?"" I asked the goat

"" Your in the ruins and it appears you fell through that hole in the surface""

""What hole I never fell through a hole"" you said in a nervous tone

"" Ah well it seems you hit your head also because that's the only way to come down here""  she said

""What do you remember my child?"" She asked 

""I was in a fight after running for so long and...""

You look at your body to see a grosome scar across your chest and your finally realizing that you were hit badly ,it was supposed to be a fresh injury why was it healed?

""I was hit badly and fell at the end of the universe""

""Universe? Ah tell more more at my home  I'll take you to my home and It'll feed you, you must be starving""

I was hungry so I agreed to go and as we were walking I felt someone looking at me and a quick look around you see a flower as it went around the corner 

You both continue walking until you reach a dummy and she says
""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to teach you something go up to the dummy""

I walk up to the dummy and yku look at it's eyes 

Suddenly a half yellow and half blue heart with a bright red circle in the middle comes in front of you,what seems to be a menu is also present 

(Attack) (Act)  (Items) (Spare)

(HP 1/1) ( Magic 100/100)  (Love:1) (exp 0/20 )

Name:unknown

Name unknown? I remember my name... what is it what's my name? Why can't I remember my name?

I need to think of something, and you thought of a font""sans"" 

""New name selected"" a voice says
""Sans is your name now"" the voice says
""What?"" You say 

Name Sans


Toriel grabs your shoulder gently and says"" your soul has three traits?""

""Wait what you can see this?"" You say 

""Yes I can as long as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you...but it's strange I have never seen this before a soul having three traits? And yku having 1 hp is completely absurd""

""How much ""HP"" are you supposed to have?"" You ask 

Toriel says "" for humans it's 20 HP and another thing is your magic humans are not supposed to have it the only time I have seen a human use magic is was when the great war happened but that was centuries ago ""

You ponder what she means for a second, your very confused and curious to what you can now do""

Chosen ""fight"" and two options come

 (physical)  (magic)

Chosen (magic) and

Nothing happens until you point your hand at the dummy for bones to come and stab the target,the force launches the dummy back into the wall destroying the dummy 

Your shocked at the damage you done and suddenly you feel insanely tired and you look at your menu yku see ""warning low magic"" 

Toriel looks at you absolutely shocked and confused and she catches you as you fall down from exhaustion and carries you back to the house because you passed out...

You Wake up to the smell of something delicious near a warm fire in a cosy home on a couch... it's comfy

Toriel walks into the room and sees you awake she sits down and asks if your are okay and you nod,she gives you a pie and you pretty much scarf it down due to hunger

""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you liked it my child, you looked pretty hungry"" 
You nod ferociously the pie was amazing 

You ask""what is this made of"" 


 ""cinnamon and snails"" she says 

You choke immediately and start coughing 

After a few minutes of you coughing you ask 
""snails??""  

""Yes snails"" she says casually 
""It's good right?""

You nod and slowly start eating again 


You finish the food pretty fast  because you were hungry


""Are you still tired?"" She asks and you nod she motions to you to follow and she takes you to a room where a bed a closet,toys in the corner and a pretty cosy looking bed in the far right of the room,you walk in,

she says
""Have a good sleep "" and closes the door you go on to the bed and lay down for a second then pass out..

Later that night.. you wake up to a lie beside the bed in a dark room you get up and touch the pie only for it to disappear ""new item in inventory"" that voice comes again,this time you hear the voice better and it's a female voice it doesn't sound like a robot or anything it sounds like a girl that's bored

This is not a real story lmao, this is copypasta [REDACTED_USER] is a piece of shit lmao. Gave me the scare of my life after getting out of my classes at college, thought someone had gotten my account info.

 I fucked a potato when I was 14. I got the idea from a radio show and thought that it might feel good. I cut a hole long ways through the middle and used it to jerk off. It wasn't enjoyable at all and I remember the guilt and shame I felt as I snuck a broken, cum covered potato to the side of the house to throw it in the garbage can. It smelled weird as well.  I told some friends at school and it became pretty common knowledge, not that I cared. I never really had too much of a problem getting laid in my school years and I think me and that potato taught a lot to each other. Some of the girls who heard about it found it kind of intriguing.  Looking back on it that potato was the only thing I've fucked that didn't lie to me and betray me. It was there when I needed it, it didn't talk and performed its duties admirably (though it was a bit cold, rough, and slimy) and it probably would have fed me if I needed it to. And I discarded it like so much flotsam in a sea of mediocrity. I'll pay for this mistake for the rest of my life.  Some times at night when I can't fall asleep I still think about you, noble spud. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I didn't mash you the way you needed me to, I was young and stupid. Now you're in a landfill and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a bigger, more putrid landfill they call the United States. Maybe on some other life we can, you know...

So I'm [REDACTED_NAME] trying to tell people my story about everything that's happened, that I can recall over the last couple years. Hopefully by reading this you'll understand why I am [REDACTED_NAME] way I am [REDACTED_NAME], and even though I know, and I feel in my heart that things are getting better, slowly. Even though I am [REDACTED_NAME] better the old me is gone. I will never be who I once was. I will never trust people the same way ever again. I hope by writing this it will help me deal and heal with this.  forgiveness process and most of all I will try and believing in myself. You know the saying sticks and stone may break my bones, but names can’t hurt me. I call bullshit words can cause more damage the sticks and stones. Words are so powerful, still at 58 years old I am [REDACTED_NAME] equipped to understand why its easier to be mean and disrespectful to others, when I know it is easier to be kind. Not everyone is walking around thinking of ways to put people down.  My childhood was generally good, my father was a great man and Roll model. One Tuesday when I was around 8-9 years old. my father came home from work later then usual. He is standing at the kitchen counter drinking a maxwell house instant coffee, I ask are we going roller skating tonight, like every Tuesday. He looks at me and said yes give me a minute. He drinks his coffee and drives my mom one of my brothers and me to the rink and he drops us of. I looked at dad and I asked aren’t you coming in, he replies not tonight. I ask why he says ask me later. he goes home. My mom did some complaining about my dad only giving her only ten dollars for the evening. At the end of the evening, I ask. Dad how come you did not come in to share tonight. he looked at me and said Normand that 10 dollars was my last ten dollars until my next paycheck. That was when I realized how poor we were. When I started to work my first paycheck went to a pair of jeans. My very first pair, a Timex watch that still works. And the rest of my paycheck and future pay checks I gave to my DAD. As the years went by my life changed. At the age of 15. I move out of my venture began.  
  
  My wife and I have bought our very first home in longueuil. We had no choice we lost our job because my wife had a very bad attitude with people that reminded her of her mother that she hated with every ounce of her fiber. Her mom refused to come to our wedding because her invitation was not personalized to her. We are living in longueuil and working. At one point I was sick and went to see the doctor and he needed a stool sample, so I prepared the sample, I brought it to what they have in Quebec called a CLSC. basically, it's just an emergency clinic but they run on schedules. I thought they opened at 9 like most places. I got there around 5 or 10 after 9 and the lady behind the counter asks me if she can help me. now the whole time we are talking in French because talking English is frowned upon, she explains to me I am a few minutes late. so, I apologize. she looks at me and says it is OK come on in I will take you. Went into her office she starts doing the paperwork she shows me and says to me. look on the top of the page. here it says all the instructions for bringing samples to the clinic. so, I tell her I do not read French I can only talk, she says to me your Englishman I said yes. she gave me back all my stuff and said come back tomorrow. That pissed me off so much that.  I shard a few choice words and went home. When I got back to my condominium, I told my wife I had enough, all this bull shit with English French I called the agency that looked over medical facility to make a complaint. I was informed that they were in their right. if it would have been the opposite, they would do something, but because in Quebec.  English people are seen as second-class citizens. This racist province even has language police if your talking English in the workplace and some Frenchie does not like that person can call the police on you. At this point I told my wife Agnes that I want to move to the other side of the country to go drive haul truck and make good money to buy her the home that she always wanted.  Agnes’s dream was to open a Dog rescue.  Because her life was difficult, she was homeless, alone and dogs were who she respected mosy.one very important thing I learned if you are English or French, across the country there are ass holes everywhere I have been.  I left with one of my cousins for Fort McMurray Alberta. this was the first time I was away from Agnes. When we got there, it was September of 2008, just when everything started collapsing in Canada, we both lived on my credit cards. I spent almost $30,000 on my cards, after a while I found a job driving shuttlebus. Not long after I started work there, I got my cousin a job there too and we started to make a bit of money. The first company I worked for was a small transport company, my job was to bring people from the city to the work sites. From the town to the site its about a 90-minute drive. The Boss would always say that we leave no one stranded out in the cold, if we could help, we help even if they are not our customers. a few times in the winter there would be security personnel that would miss their lift, I would see them and pick them up, I was called Mr. Saskatoon. Shuttle driver.         I wanted to work on the heavy haul trucks so while I was doing transport in Fort McMurray, I applied at the school in Fort McMurray called Keyano college, they were the leaders in teaching people how to operate heavy equipment, so I made my application. I had asked the lady at the front desk; I am [REDACTED_NAME] Quebec. I heard there might be a problem with me applying, she looked at me and  said Nope no problem whatsoever, so I applied while I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my job in Fort McMurray up at the oil sands, after about a year of waiting one of my friends that had applied at Keyano college, a year after me was already called for the course so I drove to Keyano college and  I asked what was the problem. I handed in my application with everything you guys asked for an I was told there won't be any problem even if I was from Quebec, she looked at me and said sorry we don't recognize the Quebec schooling system, so your high school diploma is no good, but previously told me all was good. well believe me I had a few choice words that I shared with her and then I just left I went back to my camp, while doing my work I told my friends about what happened. Agnes. I put all my time and energy into my job in Fort McMurray. I kept on Applying at new jobs hoping to get closer to driving haul truck. There was a company that had been talking to me about leaving the present company I was working for and wanted me to work for Flint Energy. He even asked if there were other drivers that would join, so my cousin came with me to Flint with another new and good friend also came with me.. the boss explained that we were going to do the city run.   Just a few days into this job I said to my cousin, after we drop off the passengers, we should stay in town tonight. I said we are going to make a new bus route because the way was setup it was ridiculous. we stayed in town, and we spent almost the whole night just working on facilitating the two bus routes. because I had worked at a company called diversified the major bus company, I had my hands on all their city bus routs.  We divided the town up into two sections, and with the maps that I had took from diversified we were able to make two routs. one bus would take from one area, and one would take from the other area. we had so much fun doing these bus route. When we finished making the new routes. our supervisor wrote us out each a letter of recommendation with a backpack, as a thank you.    
  One day I was in the dining room, and I see commotion happening a few rows away from me. I see is a guy at a table in front of me, I thought he was spitting food back in his dish, I have a very week stomach, so I turned away, and then I just hear people calling my name out and they looked at me and said, Normand, he needs help. I did not know why they were calling me to go and help him, its like a bunch of people around him and even his brother, tried to help him and was next to him. once I saw he was in distress and his brother was freaking out and was unable to help him. I got up and walked over to him, and I gave him the j thrust or the Heimlich maneuver.  I hear my friend Dana call out harder norm, I continue to work on him pushing harder  and I do another  J thrust, and  I heard, once again from Dana Normand harder! so I repeat for a  third time and when I do it the third time, he  coughs up piece of meat I was told was the size of a hockey puck,  I just looked at him, he said thank you and he sat down. I looked at everybody and I turned and instead of sitting down I left the dining room, and I went outside, and I started walking towards my room. 150 feet from the door I sat down in the grass, and I cried, and cried for a few minutes.  As much as I liked the thought that I just finished helping some one, I had a feeling inside of me that I had never felt before, I felt terror and all I could think about was what if I were not there. Next day when Danna comes to see me and says that I should go and fill out a report about what happened, because the office already new. While I am [REDACTED_NAME], they took a picture of me and wrote this article and put it in the company's memorandum. A two-page newspaper so I was quite pleased, I was given a pocket watch as a reward. I was told a few days later he was asking about me, then I found out he went home and was never coming back.  
 I love my job and we were a team like that there was no backstabbing like where I am [REDACTED_NAME] now. there was just one big team we were 150 people and most everybody got along and those that did not get along, they did not fight, they just ignored each other just like professional should do.  it was nice working there, me and my cousin were hired to do the city bus run.  it was a long route; in wintertime it was bad and if there is an accident Oh my God the whole roads closed you cannot go anywhere. one time I was stuck in traffic, because there was an accident, I left work it was like 4 in the afternoon, and I got home like midnight, and it is only a 90-minute drive. (That is where one night we all saw a meteor in the sky. it landed in Saskatchewan.)    
  While we were living in camp, we often had fire alarms going off at all hours of the night. The first time that I heard the alarm go off. It was late at night, so I fallowed everyone outside in the freezing cold. So, A lite went off in my head and I got what I thought to be was a good idea I ran to the spot where my bus was parked, started the bus, and went to pick everyone up that I could possible fit in my bus. With the ones that were standing I must have had around 150 people in my bus. it did not bother me because I was not going anywhere because the bus was to help keep people warm. The fallowing day I was called to the office. The boss goes on telling me that I did not ask permission to use the bus in the manner that I did and ask that I do not do that again I said no problem. I went back to camp, and I told a few of my co-workers what the boss said. The next time that there was a fire alarm we were six drivers that got our busses to help keep people warm. The next day the boss called me to the office once again and told me that the company that is in charged of camp, called HIM to say thank you to him, for getting busses to help. He did not know the boss told us not to do it. And I did not mind because the bottom line is to help in any means possible. Every few weeks we have a meeting with the entire crew. While the meeting is going on, I ask a question and out of the blue the boss makes a joke at my expense. that really pissed me off. I slowly stood up, moved the table in front of me out of the way, and started walking towards him. A few of my coworkers saw me, I even remember one of the guys looked at me from across the room and shook his head no. he new I was pissed off, and him and a few others hurried across the room to intercept me.  Took me by the arm and walked me out of the meeting and he found the shop Stewart. I explain what was said, about my question. He waited tell the meeting was over and called the boss over to talk. By the ended of our conversation, he apologized to me. The very next morning I see the boss in the dinning room and while everyone was having breakfast, he went to each table and apologized, for the comment he said to me. Wow that is the sign of a good boss. Even if I don’t like him, I do have some respect for this action.     
one morning when I was getting ready for work, by the way I like being early wherever I go.  I got to this Esso gas station an all I could hear is a woman screaming so I drive around the area and then I see this young woman pushed up against the wall by a guy and she is screaming and screaming and screaming for help. I parked my bus in the middle of the parking lot and I got out of my bus, and I started walking towards them, I am [REDACTED_NAME] him to leave her be and he's telling me to mind my own business so I walked all the way up to him and asked him very politely to let her goal because now it was my business because she was asking me for help, then he started acting like  a tough guy, that made me smile. He tells me to walk away. I told him no and that I recommend to him to leave right now. (Now please understand, I am [REDACTED_NAME] against violence and will do everything not to hurt anyone, but when it comes to men hurting women or children, which is a no means no. Basically, that will be the only time I go from zero to a hundred in less then a second and I have no problem to hurt anyone that is abusing or trying to intimidate others.)  the young lady. sat in my bus to calm down. Within a few minutes she is feeling better, and with him gone, thanks to me convincing him she felt it was ok to leave. So now I am [REDACTED_NAME] to pick up my passengers and who do I see walking on the street, that same asshole that was harassing the young lady. he was pathetic, and I laughed at him.   
When we get to camp on our first day back to work, from our days off. my cousin and I are at the front desk, I see not far from us there is a guy standing there, and he looks a little lost, so I introduced myself and my cousin, I asked him where he was going, and it turned out he was starting work at the same place that we were already working. I told him to stay with us and I would make Shure that he gets to where he needed to go, which was not difficult because he was joining our crew. That same day we go to the pool hall together. while we are not actually there to play pool, we were their waiting on our rooms, the new guy asks if I play pool and wanted to play a few games of pool with me while waiting on our rooms. I beat him four games to one.  a few months later there was a few drivers sitting together and I had mentioned that I had beat him at pool the first time we met. that made him so angry, I could not understand why because I told everybody it was the only time in almost six months of playing him, was the only time I won. I have never won a game against him since then. I have come close, but this guy was an amazing pool player, but because I said I won four games out of five in front of his girlfriend. he was very angry with me. I can remember he was so mad with me that he started to insult me. next day when I walk into the pool hall. he was there waiting for me and like this guy was a piece of work. he tells me that he is going to teach me a lesson and started to insult me while we are playing, by our 3rd or 4th game.  he is doing everything he can to get under my skin, everybody here is wondering what he is doing. I just shut up and take his shit. Then his girl friend Danna who is also my good friend. Walks in with a cupcake with a candle on it and looks at me singing Happy Birthday. he turns and, he looks at me goes no its not your birthday today is it, I say yes, and I hear him mutter softly oh fuck I did not know, I new he did not know, and I took the cupcake, and left the room. Danna did not know what happened she was just shocked that I left so early. then one day a bunch of us were playing pool and the same guy comes over to where we are playing and he asked if he could join in, of course no problem were professionals. it does not matter if something bad was said or happened we are professionals we move forward, He noticed that my mood was different, and he wanted to know what has happened. so, I told him I heard about place in BC that's starting up a heavy haul course and I wanted to go but I don't have the money now and everybody knew how much I wanted to drive those trucks so out of the blue he looks at me and offers me the money, he even offered more, because I need to cover certain expenses while in school. I said no he said think about it. On my next days off. When I got home, I talked to Agnes about it. she new how much I would have loved to have had that job on the haul trucks in Fort McMurray so we agreed to accept the money, I was working for first Canada at the time I thought it was a good company, I enjoyed doing my job there but I left anyway to go to Sparwood and I lived in Fernie at a really nice bed and breakfast and I start doing my haul truck course( the course was a joke.). In the last few weeks working at first Canada five other drivers ask me if they can join me in B.C. the school guaranteed a whole bunch of machinery, but he was full of shit, nothing in our contract was respected from his part. nothing!  except I lost 9 thousand dollars, but it did give me a certificate showing that I did take a haul truck course, and it looked so fake. However, it helps me to get an interview with Teck. And from the time I finished my course to the time I started work at teck, about 2 months passed. I had nothing no income and then I find out that they are making a movie in town, and they need extras, so I gave my name only did one day but it was $350.00 I enjoyed the work and I got to meet Cheryl Ladd. this woman is tiny, but she is so beautiful, so I asked her assistant while she's in Big Bang bagel getting some bagels I asked if I was allowed to have a picture with Cheryl Ladd.  I was told yes so when she came out of the store, she stood by me. I was in such shock meeting her. I could not say anything I had no clue what to say or how to say it. Ever since Charlies angels, I thought she was so beautiful. at the same time there was another actor Giancarlo Esposito. I saw him dancing while crossing the street, and he looked to be happy.  he played in the Tom Hanks movie as a lawyer's assistant, so yep me with my big mouth I stop him and introduce myself, I went on telling him that I was sorry I did not know his work. he played in the Tom Hanks movie as a lawyer's assistant and now he is in Star Wars and some good shows I am [REDACTED_NAME] he is more known now than way back then, I saw how they make artificial snow I saw how they make fake snowbanks; it was a fun experience. After two months of waiting teck called and gave me an interview then offered me a job, and I took it. I had started working for the taxi company, in Fernie for 3 days before getting on with teck, I had so much fun driving taxi that even after I started at teck, I continued driving taxis. one evening, not long after starting to drive taxi. I did a pickup, and he was going to Park Place lodge. When I arrived at my destination my passenger asks if I was a police officer, I laughed and said no, he kept insisting that I was a police officer. When I finally convinced him, that I am [REDACTED_NAME] a police officer, he pays his bill and gives me a bag of weed and jump out of my taxi.     
  It was around New Year's Eve when I am [REDACTED_NAME] up this road and I see this girl crossing the street and its around midnight, and she is walking down the road as I'm [REDACTED_NAME], and I see this guy that just didn't look right to me. he runs across the road to be on the same side as the woman, about five hundred feet behind her. I see he is walking faster, trying to catch up to her, so I just go around the block, and as I am [REDACTED_NAME] around the block, to go back toward the young woman. I called it in to the taxi dispatcher and told them what is going on. I drive along side of the young lady, and I said can I offer you a ride and she just look at me and replies no thank you I am [REDACTED_NAME] right, I new being a man she might not want a ride because she did not call for one. I am [REDACTED_NAME] about to force her to get in my car. I call dispatch and I said she does not want to get in an I hear a voice come on the radio do not worry normand. I am [REDACTED_NAME] up behind you all take her, that was a female driver that I work with, and she had a gut feeling that the young lady would not get into my taxi. while this is going on I am [REDACTED_NAME] the guy and the moment I arrived next to her he stopped walking, he just crossed his arm and he watched. While I am [REDACTED_NAME] my dispatch what was happening the woman driver, came up behind me. I went towards him, and he just took off running. He ran back to the club. {I learnt that in previous years this night club was known as the rape club} by this time dispatch had called the police, and the other driver pulled up to her and told her, you need to get into the taxi right now. And goes on to explained to her, that I had seen a man following her. and that is why I had stopped to pick her up, thanks to my partner she got home safe. when the R.C.M.P. arrived I told them what he looked like and which club he was in. when they found him, they gave him the choice go home or be arrested for public intoxication, so he went home,   
 it was fun working at that company. the owners were fantastic, they were the nicest people for whom I have ever worked. on weekends that town becomes lively. With the ski season the population basically doubles in size. one night while working. I see Infront of a nightclub something going on outside. And the police are there trying to calm the situation down then I hear over the radio, my partner say she has a pickup from that club, going to the Raging Elk. When I heard her, I have a bad feeling? so after I dropped off my passenger. I drove towards the raging elk, and as I am [REDACTED_NAME] closer to them, I see him looking down on her and screaming at her and I just throw the vehicle into park. I was actually on the wrong side of the road when I put the vehicle in park, I was going into the parking lot and I got out of my taxi and all I hear is Normand call the police call the police, I call the police, while walking towards the female driver and the man that was causing a lot of problems. This guy is taller than me and bigger than me.  but drunk like you would not believe. you know Everybody gets shitfaced drunk in Fernie and all the little boys think they are superman, so I walked up to him while I am [REDACTED_NAME] the police, I put my hand on his chest, and I asked him to calm down. OK while I am [REDACTED_NAME] the phone with the police, he tells me you better not take your hand off me, because I'm [REDACTED_NAME] knock her out. He's being sow load that I can not hear what the police officer on the phone is saying, and me I took my hand off him. and all I saw was him hit my friend and co-worker a woman and I have a very strict rule you never put your hands on a woman when he struck her, I don't remember how I just remember him doing something to her. and I went from zero to one hundred in a fraction of a second. I threw my phone.  I tackled him and I knocked him out, he hit the ground. the police dispatcher is still on the phone, I asked my friend if she could grab my phone. she was now talking to the police. He started to wake up, so I just applied a little bit of pressure to his neck. not too much because there was blood, I think when I tackled him, he may have hit his head on the ground when he landed because I was told that he flew over the hood of the car. I remember being on one side of a white car and then I am [REDACTED_NAME] top of him on the other side. I had him in a choke hold. when the police officers started to arrive, he starts to get agitated.  one of the officers’ jumps on top of him, right next to me, to help me hold him down I do not know why he was not going anywhere. (That is me Tooting my own horn,) he jumps down any helps me to mobilize him better.  but when he did, I got a knee in my rib cage, (it hurt so bad that after everything was done, I went to the hospital to get checked out). When I went over to the officer, he was filling out his report, he asked me how I learnt how to take him down the way I did. because he had already spoken to the people standing around. I smiled I told him it is just something I know. he congratulated me for doing a good job.  I told the officer the man touched my partner and that was all I needed; he touched a woman in front of me. they bring him to the hospital, and I go too, because my ribs are hurting me. while the police were taking care of him, I had x-rays and I find out that my ribs are bruised. It was well worth the pain, a few days later I find out, that he spent a week in the hospital because of all the drugs he had in him, not because of me hitting him. When he was released from the hospital, he went straight to jail because he had a warrant for his arrest in Lethbridge, I was very happy. The owners of the taxi company are some of the nicest people I have ever met. Never knew driving taxi could be as much fun as I was having, getting to know the town where I was going to be living. A few days after I started to work as a taxi driver. Teck calls me and tells me that I am [REDACTED_NAME], but I like the employer from the taxi company, so I did both jobs for awhile. One winter night I pick up this young lady, she was from England and was here for a ski trip, but now she was going out clubbing on the way she starts telling me how the women in Fernie her were below. A few hours later I pick her up again with her boy friend, and out of the blue she askes if she can give the guy a blowjob in my taxi. I say yes sure if I can pull over and watch. Nothing happened and I dropped her and him off at the Best western Hotel. It just so happened that the very next morning I picked up the same girl. So, I asked her how she was and her boyfriend, she responds by telling me he was not her boyfriend they had just met that night and was sick all over him when she gave him a B.J. I was shocked that she was telling me all this, I am [REDACTED_NAME] to myself, wow I am [REDACTED_NAME] she told me the night before that she had class compared to the women in Fernie.   
 I would do my four days of work at tech and then I would start my days driving taxi, when I would get my paycheck from the taxi company. (I never told my wife this and never told anyone).  I would cash my check, and I would go to a shopping mall I would buy all kinds of things that would make for a nice gift. Things like jewelry watches things like that. I would walk around just giving it out to people. I remember one lady in particular; I was sitting having something to drink and eat. I saw this woman she was just amazing. She looked at me and smiles twice, while she was waiting for her food, as she leaves the counter, I leave my seat and I look at her and ask her if I can talk to her. For just a second. with a big smile she looks at me and says yes sure what is up. I tell her, I saw you while I was eating. I think your beautiful, and I would love to offer you this gift, no strings attached. I do not want to know your name nothing. she looked at me and she goes Oh my God I am a mother of two kids I have not had a Christmas present in years, I looked at her, and I said Well you have one now Merry Christmas. She looked at me with amazement she did not believe it, when she opened what I gave her. She looked at me with very big eyes, when she saw her gift, it was a pair of Dimond earrings. When I saw her smile that was all I was Hoping for. I turned and walked away. I used to do that all the time. I should be saving my money but when I see the smile when you give somebody a gift out of the blue it makes you feel good inside. I was new in that town, and every business I went into, if they were nice. I would buy a bouquet of flowers; I would tell the lady where to deliver the flowers.  the only thing the note said was. just because. I totally enjoy doing that. I must have Sent flowers to almost all the shops in Fernie. When I left Fort McMurray, to go to Sparwood. to learn how to drive hall truck I had five coworkers from Fort McMurray that asked if they could come with me if there was enough room in the class. I called the school; they said plenty of room. me and five other guys leave for Sparwood, and we all pass our course. They all got jobs right away but not me because, I was the only one that did not have a car with me. they ended up all leaving, going back to Fort McMurray.    
  One day when they decided to put all the trainees in a truck to get a feeling for it. The driver I have is criticizing and complaining about the place. I could not believe what I was hearing coming out of his mouth like I thought it was the best job in the world. It only took me a couple of months to understand why he was upset and why he did not like his job but. I love my job. I loved being a grader operator. When I started my training at teck, and I saw all the reading, writing, and studying that I had to do I was terrified I admit my reading and writing skills are pathetic., I was so happy that after seeing these trucks on T.V. back in the 1970. I was there. Little did I know the hell that I was going to live working there. The bullying started within weeks of beginning my job.

Do you know what it feels like to feel like shit? Feeling... a failure, not knowing what to do with your life? Well, that's what my little brother is going through right now.

We are a family of 6 people (my parents, my older sister, my older brother, my younger brother and me). Me (22 years old)... I am [REDACTED_NAME] one in the middle, and yes, I am [REDACTED_NAME] one who has received the least attention, but it is not something that I blame my parents, it is something that I understand. I understand that my parents were busy working so that my siblings and I had everything we wanted. For this I don't feel any kind of resentment. What's more, I don't feel anything anymore.

For you to understand, I need to go deeper into my story. Primary school was one of the most difficult stages. As a child he thought that people did what they did in order to be happy. As an adult I feel that for you to be happy, someone has to suffer. He was a naive child, I didn't realize that they were bullying me until 5th grade (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to tell what they did to me because I don't want to remember it). When I entered high school I thought that things were going to change and they did, at least a few months were calm, but that hope I had of believing that everything would not be the same again faded a few months later. Thanks to these events my grades went down, I was about to repeat the year three times in different years. I currently owe subjects because I couldn't finish studying. Three months before I finished high school I stopped going because I couldn't take that humiliation anymore.
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] angry with them, they must have had their reasons for doing what they did, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] with myself, for not defending myself, for not having had a little pride.

Due to homework I couldn't start studying what I dreamed of being when I grew up. A year after leaving high school I wanted to take those subjects, but since it was a pandemic year I couldn't. The following year I couldn't either because there were no teachers who could take the exam for me. At that precise moment I gave up, I went into depression, but it wasn't like the depression I felt when I was being bullied, it was different, and by being different I was able to get out of it on my own, I didn't need anyone's help.
If you ask me if it was difficult to face that alone, it was very difficult. More remembering the moments that I thought would be the best of my life, they were truly hell.

After a year and a half feeling like a failure, like a shitty person, and seeing how my brothers fulfilled their dreams and I didn't, I wanted to try again. I am [REDACTED_NAME] exercising, I am [REDACTED_NAME] to change my physique to feel good about myself at least, I am [REDACTED_NAME] taking those subjects that I should little by little, I am [REDACTED_NAME] and I feel moderately good. I think finding out I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to be an uncle helped a little with my mental change.

Well... Being so focused on myself, I didn't realize what was happening at home, two months ago I found out that my older brother is in his depressive stage. And he makes me a little angry. He is constantly saying that he wants to give up his life, that he doesn't want to be here anymore. My sister, in addition to being pregnant, has relationship problems and is stressed trying to help my dad. My parents are in their separation stage and I just found out that my younger brother is in the same stage that I went through.

I don't know if I'm [REDACTED_NAME], but instead of feeling empathy for them and wanting to help with something at least. I don't feel anything, in fact I want to get away, I want to go to another country. I want to search for the dream that I should have searched for a long time ago. I wanted to test if the lack of empathy and emotions that I lack are only with my family, but it happens with everyone.
I don't want to go to a psychologist, I've already been to many and they didn't help me during my worst stage.",1

When I was in 6th grade I rode the bus to and from school. There was a guy who was in the year above me who also rode the bus. He always got into trouble at school, but he was still popular. One day he joined me in my bus seat, and I always sat alone. I didn’t want him to be there because I didn’t know him and I thought he was annoying. I told him not to sit by me, but he didn’t listen. He did it throughout the following week and one day he started scooting closer to me. He put his hand on my thigh, and I told him not to. He didn’t listen, and he started moving it up a little, and I threw his arm off of me. I yelled at him to get up and move and he did. But what I really remember is how the people around me on the bus didn’t do anything. Boys, who were older than me, and his friends sat there and watched it happen. I felt scared and helpless because people who could’ve done something, didn’t. They just looked at me with some sort of concern in their eyes, but that was it. I didn’t realize what it was at the time, but reflecting on it now I felt violated. 
Then 3 years later, in my freshmen year, the same guy touched my shoulder. I think his friends just told him to go up to some random girl and ask her a question. The way he got my attention, though brought back all of the feelings I had as a 6th grader. At this point in my life I realized what he made me feel and all of the helplessness I felt when I was 12 came crashing back to me. I had been unwillingly touched by the same boy twice in my life. He had put me in a situation where others watched and did nothing about his treatment toward me again. This time his friends laughed. They didn’t know what he did to me. I doubt he even remembered what he did to me. 
Yet these interactions feel so small compared to what other women go through in their life that I’ve never shared it with anyone. Because why would being touched on the shoulder trigger me? With the second interaction there was no sexual meaning behind it, he wanted to make a joke of me sure, but nothing sexual. But to this day the way the boys around me reacted stays with me and shapes the way I interact with every man I meet. Because how would they react if it was their friend? I remember his name and face, and I don’t think I’ll ever forget them. I needed to tell someone my story because it’s been weighing on me since.",1
167kmvq,1693606009.0,2023-09-01 22:06:49,stories,A woman helped me when I was homeless and I'll never forget her.,"When I was younger, I was homeless. I had been emancipated from my family and had a lot of trauma from being raped at age 15 along with other abuse throughout my childhood. I ended up getting into drugs, and then decided the only way to get sober was to hitchhike around the state so I could never make connections.

I was young, naive, scared, traumatized, and alone. One thing you learn very quickly when you're homeless is that people treat you as sub-human. I got my first criminal charge at age 18 for sleeping in a public park. They woke me up and told me to leave in the middle of the night, I had nowhere else to go. People avert their eyes when you walk by. You aren't allowed to use the bathroom anywhere, even if someone else looking less homeless would have been allowed. People shout things at you and talk down to you. It's pretty demoralizing. 

One day, I was sitting on the sidewalk and holding a sign that I think just said ""hungry"". (I didn't have a lot of skills and couldn't maintain a job because of moving around. I was also afraid to have more than a few dollars at a time because my sobriety was still fresh. I realize now the issues with begging, and would never do it again.)

Anyways, this woman walks by me with two young daughters and looks at my sign. She looks at me and says, ""You're hungry?! Well why don't you come eat with us?"" Keep in mind, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to people shielding their children from me. Children would walk by me and ask their parents questions and the parents would shush them and rush them along. I was taboo. Not to be acknowledged. 

So already this was astounding to me. She is letting me eat a meal with her and her children? She takes me into the restaurant and we all sit down. She asks me about my life and why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the streets. She asks me about myself. She seems genuinely interested and not afraid. This is the first time I've been treated like a human in a long time. She gets me breakfast and even a dessert, which I try to refuse. 

After that, she gave me money and her phone number on a piece of paper. She said to call if I ever needed anything. Her name was Dawn.


I will never forget her. Dawn, if you're out there, you reminded me that day that I was still human. That I deserved kindness and respect. That I wasn't some broken, scary monster. Thank you. I will never forget that. 

If I still had her number I would call in a heartbeat, but it was lost when my backpack was stolen a few months later. 

Also, in case anyone cares, I have been sober for six years now and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] and working. Almost done with my associates degree.

Edit: A few people have asked how I got housed, so I'll put it here. Social programs, funded by the federal, state, and local government. That's literally it. I went to a rehab paid for by Medicaid, a transitional housing program funded by my county and the federal Housing Authority, and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] using my Section 8 Housing voucher funded by the federal government (although I'm [REDACTED_NAME] in IT now so I hope to be completely self-sufficient soon ;) ) Fund social programs! They work!",4540
mzd09t,1619485771.0,2021-04-27 01:09:31,stories,There Are Voice Narrators Who Are Forcing Writers to Write Horror Stories On Reddit In Order To Profit On YouTube,"

My weekly scary stories that I post on subreddits to include 
r/scarystories and 
r/wholesomenosleep had caught the attention of a moderator on the Discord app group ""OnlyTheBestWriters,"" where a collaboration of other writers were also invited to work together and discuss current reader trends.

There were 10 other horror writers who were selected for the exclusive Discord group where each writer had a minimum of one hundred thousand Reddit post karma points from the various stories that they have have posted and had over 500 Reddit followers.

The moderator who went by the username, [REDACTED_USER]$ was a really nice woman who went out of her way to make sure everyone was properly introduced to the group and felt welcomed.  Being that we are all writers, it didn’t take long for us to start typing away and finding additional information about each other. All of the writers in the group are from the United States and our occupations vary from being professional writers to construction workers, where there are a mix of five woman and five men.

[REDACTED_USER]$ was proactive in the group where she created “ice breaker activities,” where we even learned more about each other like our occupations, ages, and where each other lived.  Though we were all talented writers, we all felt like individual islands prior to joining the Discord and now there was a sense of a community within the group.

As the weeks went on,
[REDACTED_USER]$ started her own narration business where each of our stories would be narrated on YouTube.  In the past, this was quite a common thing to occur to have our stories narrated but [REDACTED_USER]$ promised us $1 per 100 views which was by far the best offer any of us writers in the Discord group had ever received especially considering some YouTube videos could receive 100k views or more.

[REDACTED_USER]$ had us link her subreddit page that contained all of her YouTube links at the bottom of our stories, so our readers could access her YouTube account.  

All of the Discord members in the writers group would check their respective YouTube narrations and we would all comment on how the number of views would rise each day.  One of my stories was at fifty thousand and was continually growing.  Another writer had close to a half million views and we were celebrating every day knowing we were eventually going to get more and more money.

[REDACTED_USER]$ had us all open a PayPal account and we would all check it daily to see when we would receive our first payments from her.

Weeks went by and we continued to send [REDACTED_USER]$ our stories, where she would narrate them and we were all talented writers in the Discord group so most of our stories would get well over the one thousand upvotes on the various subreddits, that we posted them on.  However, one writer in our Discord group [REDACTED_USER] posted a message on the Discord saying that he had received a private message from [REDACTED_USER]$ that the stipulation of our contract for the narrations was that each one  of our stories we posted had to get a mandatory one thousand upvotes and that he was in violation for not meeting the contractual amount of upvotes.  [REDACTED_USER] then said “I’m being threatened that I have to personally reach out to my followers to beg for upvotes and also has anyone actually been paid yet?”

The comment from
[REDACTED_USER] set off a tidal wave of other comments from writers in the Discord group where everyone was getting pissed off because no one else had actually received any money either.  Also the so called contract was embedded in small print in the rules section of the Discord group that no one had bothered to read.

[REDACTED_USER] commented on our Discord group that he wasn’t reaching out to any of his followers until he was paid as promised for the six previous stories that were narrated by [REDACTED_USER]$, which everyone agreed was an appropriate measure.

Two days later  
[REDACTED_USER] posted on our Discord group that he got suspended from his elementary school teaching job because of “bogus” photos of him with an unknown underage boy.  He swore that the photos were photoshopped and he has no idea of the identity of the photographed Korean looking boy.  To make matters worse the mother of the boy came forward to the superintendent of the school district and corroborated the story so he’ll likely face criminal charges and be fired from his job.

There was collective silence in the group because not only did we feel an eerily coincidence to [REDACTED_USER]$’s threat towards [REDACTED_USER] and his current demise but if you listen really carefully to [REDACTED_USER]$’s narrations you can pick up on a very slight Asian accent.  An accent where English was her first language, but she probably also spoke an Asian language frequently at home, based on approximately one in 20 of her words she spoke that would have an Asian tone to it.  It kind of reminded me of watching the movie, The Goodfellas, where you could tell the character’s. first language was English, but they talked with Italian slang mixed in.

With all the stuff going on with [REDACTED_USER], [REDACTED_USER]$ sent him another private message saying that his most recent story was still below the one thousand upvote mark and that he needed to fix it immediately or there would be consequences.

U/sixheadedtoad posted that message on our Discord group in a panicked state saying “I can’t even go to the grocery store without someone calling me a ‘pervert’ for something I had no involvement in and now I’m be threatened with ‘consequences’ if I don’t get more upvotes on my story.  What do I do?”

Everyone in our Discord group was in a panic as well and we all felt unsafe posting anything negative in our Discord group for fear of reprisals from [REDACTED_USER]$.

I could really start to see the panic in [REDACTED_USER] where he started posting messages nearly every hour on our Discord group such as “I reached out to all of my followers to upvote my story but I’m still short. What do I do?”  The sad part was that nobody responded back to him for fear from [REDACTED_USER]$.  So the next hour he said he randomly gifted other Reddit users coins with a message begging them to upvote his story.  By the end of the day and spending close to five hundred dollars of his own money, he finally got the one thousand upvotes.  

I could only assume that [REDACTED_USER]$’s motivation for the one thousand upvotes was for her listeners to see that she only gets the best quality stories and also to force us writers to write good quality stories, but also she is a deranged psychopath who has control issues.

[REDACTED_USER] messages changed gears to him being suspended at work to him pressuring the police to further question the unknown Korean women and her son, who he apparently had an inappropriate relationship with based on the “bogus” photos.

Today is Friday and [REDACTED_USER]$ posted on the Discord group that our “Stories must be posted by Monday morning!”

The joy we all once received from entertaining our readers on Reddit has now turned into absolute fear.  For we know that we have to get at least 1000 upvotes or else [REDACTED_USER]$ will do something to terrorize us.

The scariest part that we all learned from [REDACTED_USER]’s situation was that [REDACTED_USER]$ knows everything she needs to know about us, which includes our names, where we lived, where we worked and our families, so we couldn’t even just leave Reddit and stop writing.

Monday came and we all posted our stories on our chosen subreddits.  Then each one of us vented on the Discord group saying things like “my story is crap because I felt so pressured” or “I’ll be lucky if I get 10 upvotes.”

It seemed like last week we were all waiting to see how much money our narrations would bring us but now not only did none of us expect any money, but we were much more worried about if our individual stories would get the minimal one thousand upvotes, so we wouldn’t be terrorized.

So now everyone’s posts on the Discord group were for given updates on the status of their upvotes.  For some, the upvotes were trending to a point where they would exceed the required upvotes but for about two others they knew they were far short and were going to have to rely on some desperation tactics to gain more upvotes.

Fortunately for me, I knew that I would be fine for this week because I had a good quality story already written about a month ago that I was holding on to, but I was more concerned about the following week.

[REDACTED_USER] had posted on  the Discord group that the photos were taken to the police crime lab where indeed they were determined to be photoshopped.  Also, [REDACTED_USER] said that the original Korean women who had  stepped forward had also vanished.  He went on to say that the damage has been already done and he will always be labeled as a pervert in his school district even when he gets reinstated in his job.

Today is now Friday and 
[REDACTED_USER], who had only gotten 500 upvotes, posted that when he returned from work yesterday his house was burnt down by a suspected arsonist.  

To try keep herself safe,
[REDACTED_USER] has been sending random Redditor’s lewd pictures of herself to try to garnish more upvotes because [REDACTED_USER]$ had been threatening her but hasn’t done anything drastic yet.

By Friday night [REDACTED_USER]
might have sold her soul by sending the lewd photos but she managed to get the 1000 upvotes.  She was really emotional in her Discord posting’s commenting how she’s married with kids and just sending photos wasn’t good enough for some of the Redditor’s to get an upvote, so she had to do some really regrettable things just to protect her family and her job.

We also received another message from [REDACTED_USER]$ saying that our stories were due on Monday.  The whole week, I was working on a story about being the only passenger on a plane and landing in an abandoned airport.  It wasn’t my best and it wasn’t my worst story that I have written, but it had hope .

Everyone else on the Discord group were posting that they couldn’t come up with any good stories because they were too stressed out to think clearly.  Six of the Redditor’s on our Discord group had deleted their Reddit accounts and their Facebook accounts.  After I posted my story on Monday, I tried calling each of the six Redditor’s respective employers, where I was told for each six of them that they had abruptly quit, so I have no idea of their whereabouts or what happened to them.

The sad part is that [REDACTED_USER]$ found six new replacements for them on the Discord group, where [REDACTED_USER]$ repeated the same cycle of initially being nice and welcoming in order to gain their personal information from the new group members.

I have a wife and a young daughter so I was really feeling the pressure. I have a federal job with good pay where I couldn’t just run and hide somewhere, where I work as a psychologist in a federal correctional institution. A lot of my stories are derived from hallucinations that the psychiatric inmates have told me or actual real life events that the inmates have told me as well, so I have no shortage of horror stories that I have a tendency to add my own twist.

My mindset was that, I just had to do what [REDACTED_USER]$ expected of me so my daughter, Grace could continue her happy suburban life.

However, I also had a plan up my sleeve, where I was going to wait for [REDACTED_USER]$ to get sloppy and leave a clue to her actual identity whether if it was through her Discord harassment posts, or through her narrations, or through one of her henchmen or henchwomen that she contracts to carry out her evil deeds, but I was determined to find her real identity.

I know [REDACTED_USER] told the police about [REDACTED_USER]$ but once he was cleared of his charges he didn’t want to pursue [REDACTED_USER]$ or the unknown Korean woman for fear of further retaliation from [REDACTED_USER]$ and the police had such a back log of other criminals to pursue that they were more than happy to drop the case.

So on top of my job, I continued to post my weekly stories where some weeks I barely came close to the 1000 upvotes.

I even sent a private message to one of the new Discord writer’s, warning her not to reveal any personal information on the Discord group and in fact leave Reddit altogether before it was to late, but she foolishly forwarded the message to [REDACTED_USER]$ and luckily the only thing that happened to me was that my 2006 Camry was fire bombed in the parking lot of my job.  I figured an old car was much easier to replace than my house or the loss of my wife and daughter.  So now I post nothing in the Discord group and watch as these poor new writers dig their own graves.

Once [REDACTED_USER]$ gets all the personal information she needs on the writers, then she’ll start getting more and more evil and nonchalantly throw out  [REDACTED_USER] or  [REDACTED_USER] usernames to the new members and brag how she “altered” their lives. She would even post how erroneous accusations against her to YouTube are pointless without actual police charges or an arrest.  She really was a true sociopath who lived off of power and fear from others.

As much as I tried to just post my stories on Reddit and pretend that I had never met [REDACTED_USER]$, I found my self constantly looking at the Discord app to she if she would mistakenly post a comment that was too revealing about herself that she was too slow to erase or I’d listen for countless hours to her narrations for any type of background noise that she inadvertently let slip into her recordings.

As the weeks went on my wife made me go see a therapist because I “looked horrible” and because I was more and more detached from her and Grace, where I never told either of them that I was being forced to write stories under the threat of physical harm.

So I went to the therapist and blamed my lack of sleep and emotional detachment on a mid life crisis versus some psycho path who was trying to use me as slave labor.

Ironically as I was driving home from a therapist appointment, I was painfully listening to [REDACTED_USER]$’s voice in one of her narrations, when I almost slammed my car into a tree when I heard a voice that wasn’t her’s in the background.

I knew she just posted this story so I quickly pulled over knowing that she would erase the story at any moment once she realized the mistake she made.

I pulled over and listened over and over to her narration and I yelled out “I got you, I got you, you dumb witch. I got you,” because after replaying the recording at least ten times, I was certain that I heard the distant automated voice on a passing train say “Temple University.”  I had visited Temple as a potential college when I was in high school and I remembered hearing that voice then taking the train to go see the campus of Drexel.

I figured she must have a house or an apartment on Temple’s campus and for whatever reason, she got sloppy for this narration and inadvertently left a window open or something for the train sound to be heard.

Though this woman was a complete psychopath, I also knew from my years as a psychologist that she wasn’t dumb and more than likely she probably held a faculty position at Temple.

I was really fortunate that I pulled over when I did to listen to the mistake in the background of the narration, because she had erased the story from YouTube no more than five minutes later.

When I got home, I went right on Temple’s website and sifted through all the women that fit the profile of [REDACTED_USER]$, which I narrowed the candidates down to 10 potential women.

Because it was 9:00 p.m. at night, when I attempted to call each of them, I got their voicemails which made my job 10 times easier of trying to hear hear their voices.  I wasn’t a voice expert but some of the woman could be easily excluded based on the pitch of their Voice’s or more so if they had a distinct accent.

Then I was in total disbelief when it came to voicemail number seven on my list, because based on only about 20 quick words she spoke on her voice recording, I was 100% certain it was her, because I had listened to thousands of hours of her voice narrations, where I just wanted to stick a butter knife in both of my ears, but all those painful hours of listening to her recordings had just paid off.

Her name is Mary Kim and she is an associate professor at the university.  Out of all the years, I worked as a psychologist in the prison, she wins the prize for being the biggest sociopath, where she thought she could just terrorize people under an alias of [REDACTED_USER]$ and never having to show her face, so she could hide and live a “normal life.”

One of her students had actually posted a short YouTube video of her lecturing in front of the class, where I was even more convinced after listening to her lecture that she was [REDACTED_USER]$.

The next thing I did was reach out to all the current and past Discord group members and I sent them the YouTube message of Professor Kim lecturing in front of the class.

I learned that not a single one of the Discord members went to the police but instead took matters into their own hands where they had each devised their own ways to torture [REDACTED_USER]$ or who they just call Professor Kim now.

[REDACTED_USER]$ like me just couldn’t leave her job, so when she gets “kidnapped for the weekend” or comes home to her apartment by the train station and finds everything missing, it’s no wonder she’s developed a terrible stuttering problem and probably couldn’t do the YouTube narrations anymore if she tried.",58

Non-Fiction

Tinder, UHN and the Ontario health system, a cautionary tale.

This story reflects an arduous and stressful journey that has extended over two years and is still not finished. My frustration commands me to write this, it’s the only therapy available to me at the moment. If you are looking for some twitter-like quips and quick gratification, you will not find it here. My story will take quite some time to write, presumably a bit less for you to read, but still it will be an investment. You are forewarned.


My Tinder Experience

I’m an older white male. Two years ago I had a profile on Tinder and matched with a younger black girl who had immigrated to Canada approximately one-and-a-half years prior. We conversed online. I was looking for something casual centered around intimacy. She was looking for someone who could take her around, provide restaurant meals, shopping trips, and generally make her feel special. 
We met a few times just prior to the start of the pandemic. It’s my perception that we were both happy with our relationship, but the pandemic made it impractical to continue. We stopped meeting.


My Health Issues

Approximately 4 weeks after my last meeting with my Tinder date I developed a pain in my tongue. Not a sharp pain, but a constant ache. I didn’t think much of it, but after about a month I contacted my family physician for help. Everyone was in full lockdown mode at this juncture, and he does not use video calls, so I described my symptoms to him on the telephone and he prescribed an anti-fungal treatment (he still restricts himself to phone consultations to-this-day). The anti-fungal treatment ran for about a month and during this time I experienced the sudden onset of a constant ringing in my left ear. When I was in a noisy environment the ringing wasn’t very noticeable, but when I was trying to fall asleep at night it seemed annoyingly loud. At the end of my fungal treatment I reported that my tongue pain continued and also reported my new hearing issue. He told me to repeat the fungal treatment for another month and said that he would set up an appointment with an ENT specialist when the pandemic allowed. This was March 2020.

The second anti-fungal treatment was no more effective than the first. By June I was able to meet with the ENT specialist who conducted a hearing test then pronounced me fine. He said such symptoms were not uncommon at my age and would probably diminish naturally over time. My family doctor then set up a second appointment with a different ENT specialist to examine my tongue pain. When I met with him in September 2020 he poked a flashlight in my mouth, probed around with a popsicle stick, that then pronounced me “normal”.
I then developed an itchy skin rash on my back. This didn’t seem that unusual and I ignored it for about a month. However, after that month It was unusual to have a rash that was this itchy and persist for this long so I visited the public clinic at Centenary hospital. The attending physician was concerned. The rash in his opinion featured raised bumps that were unusual and ruptured at their peak. His concern was primarily due to the fact that there was no associated inflammation. To him this suggested that they might be cancerous. He referred me for a follow up appointment with a dermatologist, but 4 weeks later was the earliest available appointment. In the interim period I swabbed the rash with a topical antiseptic (chlorhexidine) trying to ease the itch. Surprisingly the rash healed almost immediately after this treatment. By the time of my dermatologist appointment the rash was gone, and he assessed me as, once again, “fine”.

Throughout the year I also experienced vision issues. For the most part my vision seemed normal, but when I was outside and looked up at a clear sky on sunny days, I saw dark clouds in the fluid of my eyes. It looked like someone had used an eyedropper to put a few drops of black ink in the fluid in both eyes and it had only partially mixed. It was a subtle effect that was only visible under bright light against a light background, but it seemed to get worse over time. I visited my optometrist and had her run the usual battery of eye tests. I explained my issue and asked her to look for anything that could explain it. If you guessed that she told me “everything looks fine”, you are correct.

My health issues were annoying and concerning to me, but the specialists assured me that everything appeared normal, so I endured my constant tongue pain, ear ringing, and cloudy vision. The tongue pain gradually migrated to include my throat. I hadn’t seen my Tinder date for over 9 months and it did not occur to me at that time that there might be a link between her and my health complaints, but that would soon change.


My Health Crisis Begins

At the end of February in 2021 my world suddenly imploded. During the last week of the month I felt increasingly anxious for no apparent reason. As the week ended I was suddenly overwhelmed with nausea, anxiety and insomnia. A pattern developed. I would feel unwell during the day and had no appetite, but as the evening approached, I could feel my metabolism start to race. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t lie down, I had to pace my bedroom thru the night just to avoid screaming. When I did lay down, I felt compelled to curl into a fetal position to try and mitigate my distress. I immediately booked off sick from work (I normally worked weekends). It was Friday. My family doctor only works Mon-Thurs and I couldn’t suffer through the weekend this way. Plus, I knew that the only remedy that he could provide would be a referral to a specialist and that typically takes weeks or months to effect, I couldn’t wait.

It was during one high-anxiety state that my eureka moment occurred. I was trying desperately to fathom what was happening to me. I’ve never suffered from stress-related issues. I’m so low-key that it’s a source of ribbing from my friends. I was sure that my emergency was physiologically based, not psychological. But what? Then I remembered that my Tinder date had sent me a message shortly after we stopped seeing each other the previous year complaining of a “severe sleeping sickness” that prevented her from sleeping at night, combined with a sore throat. But that was over 10 months ago? If her problem was related to mine what ailment would have such long gestation period? I ruled out fungal and bacterial infections, and then considered the possibility of a parasitic infection. My research soon made me realize that there were a number of common parasites in Africa where my Tinder date had migrated from, and that it was common for them to have subtle or no symptoms for months, even years. Trypanosomiasis seemed to fit my situation very well. My Tinder date, who I could no longer contact, had used the term “sleeping sickness”. Research stated that trypanosomiasis infections could exist for a year or more with few symptoms, but that serious and debilitating symptoms could occur once the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier into the CNS. I concluded several things at that moment, i) I had a parasite infection, and ii) I contracted it from my Tinder date, and iii) it was not just responsible for my current emergency but also explained my hearing, tongue, skin and vision afflictions over the prior year.


The Hospital Emergency Room Odyssey

I made my way to the Emergency department of NYGH on a Friday night. I gave them all of my information and shared my conclusions. They were quite efficient. They expressed some incredulity but invested significant effort in researching how to test for trypanosomiasis, and they took multiple blood samples. They told me to expect results in a few days and arranged for a follow-up in an already scheduled outpatient clinic on Tuesday (by telephone). I dreaded having to wait that many days without any relief but had no choice. It was a hard 4 days. When Tuesday came, I was informed that my results were negative. They expected me to be relieved. I was devastated. They told me that I was fine but I found living through each day almost unbearable. I was certain that I had acquired a parasite infection from my Tinder date, and was desperate when they informed me that in their opinion no follow-up was needed. That night I scoured the Internet for help and discovered that UHN had a “Tropical Disease Unit” that was dedicated specifically to this type of infection. This would be my salvation. They would have the expertise needed to put together the story told by my issues. Using their expertise, they would be able to identify the pathogen based on the aggregation of my numerous symptoms. On Wednesday morning I made my way to the emergency department at Mount Sinai (part of the UHN network).


My UHN TDU Debacle

Mount Sinai ER department was fine. It took some time to be seen but not unreasonable. I recounted my story knowing that they would have access to my NYG records as well. The ER doctor was pleasant enough and after a few delays told me that he would refer me to the UHN TDU. This was the result that I wanted, and I thanked him. During our discussion he asked some probing questions that made it obvious that he thought my issues may be rooted in psychosis. Regardless, he offered to prescribe Zopiclone, and I hesitated, but then agreed. This was fortuitous as it turns out. He stated that I should expect to be given an appointment with the UHN TDU within a week. I was on sick leave, missing work, and miserable so all these delays were torture, but I at least had hope for relief. That night I tried Zopiclone and found that it allowed me to sleep for a few hours each night, a vast improvement. I also found my anxiety was less extreme, but I could still eat almost nothing. I left Mount Sinai and went home to wait for my UHN TDU appointment.

Two weeks passed and I heard nothing. I called the UHN TDU, still nothing. I sent emails, they were unanswered. Finally in desperation, I went to the TGH ER (the UHN TDU is in the building). It was a very unpleasant experience. They kept me waiting for 8 hours while they cycled through individuals who had arrived much later. It was apparent to me that I had been labelled as a “head-case” and the wait was their way of discouraging me from using them as a resource. To top it off after about 6 hours in the waiting room the administration resource from the UHN TDU called my cell phone and set up an appointment for the following week. It was clear that they knew I was downstairs and that they made the appointment under duress. The ER doctor finally talked to me after everyone else departed but had nothing to offer. At least I had my appointment with UHN TDU.

The UHN TDU appointment was by phone, and all business. The lead doctor attended. I told my story. She proffered a few opinions based on her expertise, the gist of which was ""I don't think you have this infection"", but regardless she provided lab requisitions for a battery of blood tests including another trypanosomiasis antibody test. We concluded after about 20 minutes on the phone. I immediately went to the TGH lab to complete the tests, then waited for results. They scheduled a follow up telephone conversation about a week later. The trypanosomiasis test was negative. The generic blood suite was within normal ranges. I was well. Go away, quit bothering us (paraphrased).

I protested. I was sick. I had serious symptoms. They are indicative of a parasite infection. I have a probable source for infection. There are other parasites that could be the cause of my symptoms... they didn’t care. They did promise to set up future status appointments for some reason, but I doubt it was for anything beyond keeping up appearances. I sent several emails to their administration mailbox trying to get them to re-engage. They ignored me. I went on disability leave at work because my lack of sleep and other symptoms made it impossible for me to work. I still couldn’t eat and had lost 10lbs in 4 weeks. I had a debilitating, life-altering illness and the top expert institution in Ontario on tropical disease/parasite infections were ignoring me. I needed help. I tried to apply to become a patient at the Cleveland Clinic in the US and submitted screen prints from my UHN TDU tests that were required in the application. The CC saw the UHN TDU doctors name on my test results and contacted her without my knowledge or permission. She obviously warned them off because after that they quickly declined to accept me as a patient. Then I received a threatening note from the UHN doctor saying she would sue me if I used her as a reference (I had not done that). It was clear to me that UHN TDU was uninterested in my case, and it also was apparent that the lead doctor was increasingly antagonistic. It was also clear to me at this point that with the UHN TDU references on my health record that no other doctor/institution would agree to see me, UHN TDU was the expert.


Desperate Times, Desperate Measures

I felt crappy. I could barely eat. I was losing weight rapidly. I had extreme insomnia. I was on disability leave from my job. The medical community had frozen me out. No help was coming. Desperation drove me. I was in a technical career so I decided to research online to find out if there was anything that I could do to alleviate my situation. I researched how to detect parasites in thin blood smears under a microscope. I purchased a microscope with a video camera, slides and lancets. I spent hours drawing blood samples and examining them under the microscope for signs of parasites with the video camera running so that I would have proof of infection. When I didn’t get results immediately, I determined that I may be able to conduct a “Woo” test that involved examining the contents of a microhematocrit capillary tube after centrifugation under the microscope, and get results more reliably. I purchased a Clay-Adams Ultra 3 Microhematocrit Centrifuge on eBay along with heparinized capillary tubes and started running the Woo tests. I achieved results using the thin blood smear approach about a week before I was able to run my first Woo test. I captured a video of an immature parasite moving under the slide’s coverslip (i.e. swimming in a live blood sample). The parasite was about the size of a single red blood cell but at 400x magnification quite a few fine details of the parasite were visible. I was relieved. I finally had evidence that I was infected. I knew that UHN TDU would examine this evidence and their experience and training would allow them to identify this pathogen.  They would have seen this organism before. They would recognize it. I would finally get the diagnosis and treatment that would save me. I did not expect UHN TDU to accept my evidence as proof of infection, but I thought surely now they would allow that some more diagnostic testing was warranted. I sent a copy of the video to the administration mailbox of the UHN TDU along with pictures of my equipment and a description of the methods that I had used to get my results. Crickets. 

A week later the last bit of equipment that I needed to conduct the Woo test arrived. When I ran the Woo test a number of parasites were plainly visible at the buffy-coat boundary between the blood serum and plasma after centrifugation. Every Woo test that I conducted showed parasites. I forwarded the images of parasites from my Woo test to UHN TDU, again with pictures of my equipment and a description of my methods. Again crickets. 

Approximately 6 weeks prior to my positive blood work results the UHN TDU had scheduled a routine telephone follow-up call. That call was scheduled to happen 2 weeks after I had sent all my results to them. I emailed them reminders to check my results and hoped they would discuss them on the call. When the call came it was not the lead doctor on the line but a medical student. When I asked if he had seen my images, he said he had. It was like pulling teeth to get him to talk about them. When I pressed him to acknowledge that the results at least were sufficient to warrant additional diagnostic efforts from UHN TDU he disagreed, and dismissed my results as “contamination”.  It was clear at that moment that all of my efforts were futile, the UHN TDU would dismiss any and all evidence that I might produce, and that they had no intent of taking any further interest in my disease. To cap things off the lead Doctor sent a “final report” to my family physician stating that my problem was “irrational fear” and that my case was closed.

At this point my situation seemed surreal to me. I had contracted a parasite infection that was known to occur occasionally in Canada among recent immigrants, and with a vector of transmission that was deemed possible (person-to-person infections have been recorded but are not common). I had managed to get my case in front of the University Health Network, Tropical Disease Unit, arguably the pre-eminent authority in Canada on this type of infection, but they were dismissing me after one 20-minute telephone consultation and a suite of blood tests that only tested for one type of parasite. I’ve since deciphered what I believe to be the reason for this treatment. When UHN TDU received my referral from MS ER they reviewed my case. They decided at that time that my infection was imagined and resolved to ignore me. I forced their hand when two weeks later I went to TGH ER and sat for 8 hours, they felt compelled to make an appointment. The doctor that conducted my telephone consultation was irritated at having to waste time on me (a head-case) and resolved to do the minimum required by her professional vows and obligations conferred by her position of public trust. They never allowed that I might actually have an infection. If they had they would have expanded their diagnostic testing to include other equally common African parasites that could exhibit with similar symptoms. I was aware that there were other parasites that might be responsible, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] an expert, and that is why I was so eager to be vetted by UHN TDU. In hindsight UHN TDU had diagnosed me before my first consultation and already decided on a “one-and-done” perfunctory set of blood testing. They did the minimum they felt they were obliged to do before giving me the kiss-off.

UHN TDU is not a large unit by Toronto Hospital standards, but it is by far the most concentrated set of expertise in Ontario with respect to tropical disease. It is organized around a few key senior doctors. The careers of these doctors are multidimensional. They are affiliated with universities. They participate in WHO initiatives. They travel the world and receive accolades for dispensing western medical program assistance to third-world countries. They host press conferences from time-to-time to disseminate their expert opinion on current health issues. Oh, and yes, they see patients and practice medicine out of their UHN TDU offices as time allows. Doubtless, they are important people. Smart. Accomplished. Arrogant? Selfish? Spiteful? Willfully incompetent? Base on my experience I’d say that all these labels apply. If your disease aligns with the tunnel-vision dictated by their ego and experiential bias, they might serve you well. But if your case is unusual, if you need them to listen to you, to assess your symptoms based on your reported experience, that is unlikely to happen. They’ve evolved to the stage where their bloated sense of self-importance and infallibility allow them to dismiss your input as noise to be ignored, and to diagnose you with the minimal effort mandated by their smug conceit.  I’d advise prospective patients to seek out less esteemed doctors who still believe that symptoms should prompt testing that leads to diagnosis. Doctors who maintain some level of humility. Doctors that believe their patients experience is relevant to diagnosis.

UHN TDU labelled my infection as a psychosis. This determination was entered into my provincial health files. They refused to follow up on my symptoms or evidence, and instead closed my file. This had the chilling effect of scaring off any other health provider who may have been able to help. I was labelled as a head-case. Patients with irrational fears are rife, especially now with the pandemic, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] one. In Ontario you cannot elect what procedures or tests you will receive; you must work with a doctor and he/she must refer/order them. The UHN TDU superficial assessment ultimately had the result of discouraging even my family doctor from referring me for any further tests.

I was provided a diagnostic process that was triggered by the ultrasound imaging results that my ENT specialist ordered due to my complaints of throat pain. They showed a ""nodules"" on the front of my thyroid and lymph glands The ""nodules"" were bumpy protrusions across the front of these structures. I also had a few similar bumps on the back of my tongue on either side, as well as a half dozen more under my tongue. The nodules in my mouth had the size and appearance of warts and I had ignored them as I thought they were some common mouth sore.  Two needle aspirations, three more ultrasound sessions, and a referral to a second ENT specialist later, it's still a mystery. The biopsy's ""showed calcification"" they tell me? I'd suggest to them that the Onchocerciasis parasite is known to ""nest"" in this area but I already know that they'll throw up their hands and run from the room like my hair is on fire, so I restrain myself.  I now believe that the ""nodules"" in my mouth and on the glands in my throat are ""nesting"" macrofilaria.

Down The Self-Treatment Rabbit Hole

To recap my situation.  The pandemic had just begun.  Everything is shut down. I can't arrange in-person medical appointments, only by phone. The border between the US and Canada is closed. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] disability leave from my job. I have produced what I consider to be irrefutable microscopy evidence of parasite infection but the UHN and my family doctor refuse any further diagnostic measures. I can't eat or sleep. I felt that my only option was to try to help myself. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] an advocate for self-medication under normal circumstances but the medical community was effectively unavailable due to a combination of the pandemic and the hubris and antipathy of a couple of key doctors. I resolved to help myself using online research to identify my parasite, treatment options and drugs, then acquire the drugs and self-medicate. 

I had managed to be tested for trypanosomiasis and was negative.  My online research identified schistosomiasis as a possible culprit. I acquired and took the drug praziquantel (plus a few ancillary drugs) for this and did experience some relief from my symptoms, but as time progressed (9 months after my crisis began) it became evident that there was a disconnect between schistosomiasis symptoms and what I was experiencing. After further online research I found a better match, a filariasis infection, most probably Onchocerciasis (i.e. river blindness). This led me to take Ivermectin and other supplemental drugs. My self-medication process is a bit of a twisted path so I'll list it chronologically to make it easier to follow.

April to November 2021, Presumed Schistosomiasis Infection

Praziquantel
 
This was the primary drug used for the elimination of this parasite. The infection became acute at the end of February and by mid-March it was obvious my doctors were not going to help. I was able to purchase praziquantel formulated for humans online from Asia. After some experimentation and in consideration of online dosage information I settled on a regimen of 1800mg 3 times in one day. Initially the drug seemed to induce discomfort but this moderated with repeated use.  I experienced relief from nausea and aches in my limbs for a couple of weeks after use, but these symptoms returned so I repeated the drug multiple times.  There was a much more extensive dosage recommendation to continue taking the drug for 14 days in the case that the parasite had crossed the blood-brain barrier and invaded the CNS (central nervous system). The fact that I experienced nausea and insomnia were indicative of a CNS infection so I followed the 14 day regimen. The 14 day regimen was required so that a sufficient amount of the drug would cross the blood-brain barrier. Relief from symptoms was partial and temporary. Itchy rashes returned, leg aches returned, tongue and throat pain remained, the ringing in my ear remained.

Niclosamide, Fenbendazole, Albendazole, Flubendazole

The partial efficacy of praziquantel led to more research for other anthelmintic medications.  I purchased and took each of the medications listed above in the period between June and November 2021. Niclosamide and Flubendazole were formulated for humans, Fenbendazole for sheep, and Albendazole was for dogs. I preferred medications formulated for humans but without a prescription pet medications are often the only type available. When taking a medication formulated for a different animal it is necessary to recalculate dosage information. Pet medications are not subject to the same purity and quality standards that human medications are, but beggars can't be choosers. None of these medications had any adverse effects, but they also didn't seem significantly beneficial, 


December 2021 to Current, Presumed Filariasis (onchocerciasis) Infection

Ivermectin (horse formulation)

By November 2021 it seemed clear that the infection was not being cleared. After yet another online research effort I discovered a different parasite, Onchocerciasis. This parasite appeared to be an even better fit for my symptoms. It explained the lymph node and  thyroid nodules, as well as the issues with my vision. The recommended drug was Ivermectin. There are a number of variations of filaria parasites, and I can't claim a definite diagnosis, but the eye complications suggest Onchocerciasis. Thankfully they seem to require the same drug treatments.  Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) was the drug of choice for onchocerciasis until a couple of decades ago when it was replaced by Ivermectin, DEC ""quick kills"" both macro and micro filaria. Unfortunately it frequently triggered a dangerous immune system response called the ""Mazzotti reaction"" that could cause circulatory issues and eye damage.  Ivermectin ""slow kills"" microfilaria and renders macrofilaria infertile, avoiding a Marzzotti reaction.  For this reason it replaced DEC as the primary drug used for Onchocerciasis.  I calculated an appropriate dose to be about 1.5gm from a horse formulation. Like praziquantel, it helped but did not seem to resolve the infection after multiple applications.  Since it is a ""slow kill"" mechanism I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure that I could tell if it's working properly or if my infection is one of the documented Ivermectin resistant strains.  I know it has some effect on the parasite because after taking the drug for the first time I noticed a number of them (worm-shaped organic appearing objects) floating in my field of vision for the first time.  I believe these parasites were situated in the periphery of my eyes and were paralyzed by the Ivermectin, thus floating into my view. After half-a-dozen applications between December 2021 and February 2022 the infection is not resolved. I get temporary relief from aches and itches, but all other symptoms continue unabated. This medication had no appreciable negative side effects

Doxycycline (human formulation)

Ivermectin does not kill macrofilaria (adults),  At best, it renders females infertile.  They can remain alive for 8-15 years.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that patient.  Doxycycline kills a symbiotic bacteria that causes the macrofilaria to die after about 2 years, and also reinforces the infertile effect. I managed to buy a human formulation.  The recommended dosage is 100mg twice a day for 42 days. Near the end of this period I experienced increased tongue pain and a return of nausea for a couple of days.  I interpret this to be the result of the macrofilaria moving to escape the effect of the antibiotic. Once again it is not possible for me to assess if taking this medicine has been successful until a couple of years has passed. 

Moxidectin (horse formulation)

Moxidectin is a newer anthelmintic medication from the same family as Ivermectin.  It was approved as a substitute for Ivermectin for the treatment of human onchocerciasis in 2020. This was needed as an increasing number of Onchocerciasis infections were exhibiting resistance to Ivermectin.  The problem that I face in self-medicating is that I do not have any way to tell if my ""slow-kill"" drugs are working, or if my infection is drug-resistant. I have to wait years to find out.  Due to this I have resolved to treat myself with all available drugs unless and until I perceive that my infection has been resolved. I ran into trouble with this drug. My planned dose was 10 micrograms. The label information was unclear and I misinterpreted the amount of medication in this horse formulation.  I ended up taking about 70 micrograms.  I lapsed into unconciousness, I believe that the only reason that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to write this is the fact that my system had automatically forced me to vomit so I avoided absorbing the full dose. I regained conciousness after about 6 hours. After reviewing information online it appears that this drug is very dangerous and  dose sensitive, it can kill at as little as twice the recommended dose.  Anthelmintic drugs are typically neurotoxins.  Moxidectin appears to be strong and passes the blood-brain barrier quite readily.  I survived my overdose and have since taken the proper dose a couple more times.  It appears to be more effective than Ivermectin as, for the first time, I noticed inflammation or bruising in both eyes after treatment with this drug. However relief from itching is temporary and my tongue pain and ear ringing remain. I still see worms floating in my eyes.  


Emodepside (dog formulation)

Emodepside is so new that it is not yet approved for human use.  It is currently only used in cat and dog formulations, but human trials are underway in Africa. It's potential is due to the fact that it is from a different family of drugs than Ivermectin, so it's mechanism of action is different and cross-over resistance is not an issue. The recommended dose is 1 milligram per kilogram of weight. i did perceive some relief from symptoms after taking this, but like the others, temporary relief and ongoing tongue pain and ear ringing. 

Diethylcarbamazine (dog formulation) March 2022

I have hesitated to take this drug due to the possibility of inducing a Mazzotti reaction and causing circulatory and vision problems. However this is the only drug that causes ""quick kill"" of both macrofilaria and microfilaria, and this was the drug of choice for onchocerciasis before Ivermectin was approved.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that all of the other anthelmintic drugs that I have taken over the past year have reduced my filaria load enough to avoid this problem. My tongue pain, ear ringing, back=itching and insomnia are debilitating enough for me to be willing to take on quite a bit of risk to resolve. This drug requires dosing at about 100mg three times per day for 21 days.  I'm [REDACTED_NAME] day 7.  I have experienced a spontaneous lesion on my left ankle that was painful but has since scabbed over.  I believe that was the DEC exposing one parasite to an immune system response. I am [REDACTED_NAME] experiencing pain from the skin on my back accompanied by numerous tiny hard spots that feel like grains of sand to my touch. I interpret these to be evidence of dying microfilaria from the layer of skin just below the surface.   I assume that I'll have more of these as the days pass. I'll update this story after day 21 or when I stop taking DEC due to adverse effects, whichever comes first.

Diethylcarbamazine Follow-Up End of April 2022

DEC is a bit unpleasant to take.  The dosing regimen recommends a ramp-up over several days from 50mg per day, to 100mg per day, then continuing at 100mg 3 times per day for 20 days.  I've experienced a number of noteworthy events while taking it.  At day 15 I experienced a sudden onset of nausea that lasted for about 24 hours.  I had experienced this while taking Doxycycline as well and believe that it corresponds to parasite movement to escape the drug within my CNS. At day 18 I experienced discomfort in my groin that lasted a couple of days in combination with very bloody urine that lasted a few hours.  I believe that this is an indication of parasite movement out of their nesting structure in this area.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] by the amount of blood as the parasites that I have seen in my eyes and blood samples do not seem big enough to trigger such a large flow.  I have also experience aches and pains from different parts of my body, as well as some spontaneous blood flow on my scalp under my hair.  The good news is that DEC seems effective against the parasite and I cannot detect any evidence of a Mazzotti reaction. The bad news is that despite taking a number of different anthelmintic drugs for the better part of a year I'm [REDACTED_NAME] experiencing numerous signs of parasite infection and death. And I still see parasites floating in my eyes. I managed to be examined by an opthamologist but he could not discern the objects that I see.  I'll be happy when I can take these drugs and not experience symptoms associated with parasite death. That would allow for that possibility that I am [REDACTED_NAME] of parasites.",4

Hello, to someone who might read this. 

It feels weird to do this but I want to tell my story to people who might understand. 
I'm [REDACTED_NAME] professionally diagnosed but I definitely have deep emotional and mental problems. Please don't tell me to seek out professional help. I want to have therapy so so bad. I know that I need help, but for now it's not possible, because if I would ask my parents they would tell me I should pray to god and he would fix the ""phase"" I have. 

But I assure you, as soon I get the opportunity to seek out professional help, without my parents knowing I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to. 
As long as that is impossible I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to figure out what is going on with me on my own. 

I did so much research during quarantine because I started to question my sense of self, especially my identity and endet up having an internal crisis.

 I thought my issues weren't that deep, because I never really was physically abused and technically everything in my life was fine. I had clothes, food and an overall loving family (on the surface). And I played it down because I thought: someone like me can't call their experiences trauma, because I was never severely hit nor bullied. 

Generally people liked me (because I was a massive people pleaser and still do it but it's gotten better) or at least they were nice to me. My parents supported me, helped me out when I needed money for something. 

And now there are two parts of me fighting. 
The one part that knows exactly how f*cked up I really am and the other part that tells me I'm [REDACTED_NAME], that I should stop overthinking and stop being ungrateful. 

Im torn and I hope to find at least one person who kind of understands me. 
I feel like no one could ever get me. 
Because my ""trauma"" doesn't feel validated. 
Even though I found out that the part of the brain that is responsible for physical pain is also responsible for emotional pain. 

It still feels like I don't deserve to be heard. 
Because on the surface everything was perfectly fine. 

And even though I talked to friends about it and they really helped me, they still told me to be grateful that I was well liked and no one directly hurt me. But I can't. I can't look at the positive aspects and live normally. 

It affects my life. It affects the person I am. It shaped me. I can't concentrate (and it got worse and worse with time), I have emotional outbursts that I learned to hide, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on guard and don't feel safe in my house (because I constantly think my parents could find out something that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] fro them), I can never relax no matter where I am (except when I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my boyfriends house and I know no one is going to be at home for a longer period of time), I feel like I'm [REDACTED_NAME] worth it, I feel ugly on the inside and outside, and I hate myself for coping by overeating (I'm [REDACTED_NAME] obese nor anything near it, but if I continue to eat how I eat without going to the gym it could happen), I feel like I have to be the main mother-figure to my sisters because my mum so is emotionally detached that I don't want them to think that what she does is real love. 

But the worst thing is how distant I feel from my emotions and myself. Does a ""myself"" even exist? Can I ever be ""it""? I feel numbed out and drained, even though I do nothing all day but distracting myself as good as I can. 

I feel like I never achieved anything and that I never will. 

Everything is overwhelming and so hard to do, even the littlest homework or task. 
That's why I have a pile of work in my e-mails and in the back of my mind that stresses me the hell out. But I just can't get myself to do it unless it has a deadline (and even then I tend to it last minute). 

I feel weak, stupid and misunderstood and I think to myself: if that continues all my good marks are going to drop. And then my parents are going to be a problem even on the surface. 

Im doing my A-Levels (class of 2021) in Germany (I was born here) right now and I just feel like I can't do it. And it is required from me that I get prestigious degree. Even though I would rather pursue a singing career. 

That was the longest introduction I ever wrote, but it needed to be at least written down somewhere. 

So, what is the big deal? What am I complaining about?

 (I'll try to create a chronological order and to remember everything crucial but I yesterday realized that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] blocks of time in my memories even from recent times.) 

It all started even before I was born. 
My parents found each other through friends and got together. 

My mum lived in Kazakhstan before moving to germany (I still don't exactly know why) and my father lived in Siberia before moving to Germany (his and my uncle's parents wanted to prevent them from having to fight in a war zone) and so they happened to live in the same city and then met.
They got together and married. 

Then their neighbors invited them to go with them to a Russian-German evangelical church and they ended up being members. 

Then I was born and everything was perfect. I was in church every Sunday from the moment my mother could leave the hospital. 
I never knew anything different. 

And as soon as I was able to be separated from my mother for 2-3 hours I was with other children in my age while the adults were attending the ""big"" service. 

And then the indoctrination started. 

I don't remember much from my time in church (or the cult as I call it now) from the time before I was 12. I only remember my time in school. Which is very odd to me, but what do I know? 

I just remember being a people pleaser from the start and everything they taught us but there aren't much of clear memories. I was good at being a people pleaser. 
Now it's easy for me to approach people and connect on a surface level. 
But at what price? 

It's scary to me that my memories are so blurry. 
I don't even know who I was friends with, or if I even had friends (before the age of 10).

I just remember that I wanted to be perfect in god's eyes. I wanted to be the perfect example of a girl who loves Jesus with all her heart. 
I wanted people on church to look at me and think that I will make it far in my faith. 
And I achieved that, I think. 

But now I hate my past self for caring so much.
 
So what where we taught there? 
God created the world, Jesus died for my sins and resurrected after three days, the Bible is the only truth and the only way I must live (everything else is the devil's work) and even though they didn't say it in particular but that our church is the only one to teach the ""real"" truth and that every other church doesn't have god in it and immediately leads to hell and damnation. 

We were taught that the secular world was highly dangerous and as soon as were not following one of god's (the church's) rules, were open for demons to attack us. And to make it short: you could sin by thinking something.

 So we were taught to somehow control our thoughts but give full control to god, over every little aspect in our live, because everything is predestined and we don't have control about anything anyways. 

But we're still responsible for our actions somehow and still have a ""free will"" granted from god. 

While writing this I really understand how contradicting this is. 
And it was a core beliefe of mine. 

When an adult who looked after you as a toddler tells you this and there are 500 people who all believe it wholeheartedly, you try to justify it until you really can't anymore. 
And then everything shatters. 

Losing faith in something that was so deeply intertwined with your whole existence is like a part of you just died. Even though you know how ridiculous it was believing in it and you still feel stupid for not realizing it earlier. 

So in a nutshell everything bad you do is because you're not saved (because for someone who is ""really"" saved it's physically impossible to sin no matter how) and automatically fully your fault. But when you achieve something it's because god did it. 

You're never capable of doing or achieving something on your own. You're even unable to think in the ""right, good way"". So you're basically nothing and unimportant. 

But when you come to god, he gives you a purpose he specifically chose for you, you matter to him, you're worthy of his love (and even though we were taught he is forgiving to everyone and (almost) everything) if you only follow him everywhere he leads you. 

Another bizarre contradiction they teach little children: you're nothing but with god you're worthy. 
It makes me unbelievably mad that there are gradually more and more children who grow up believing this. 

Who are taught that demons, the devil and hell are around every corner to take them and torture them for eternity if they slip up one tiny bit. 

That's why I cried myself to sleep for years begging god to forgive me for saying ""sh*t"" one time or thinking in my head that I wanted to kiss a boy, not speaking of being attracted to a girl. 

Because of course anything then straight marriage within my church is wrong (yes I was expected to have a boyfriend within church and if he was in the ""world"" I had to convince him to go to church and he has to love god). 

We weren't allowed to date before 17 and of course no premarital s*x. But they took it further to prevent it all costs. You weren't allowed to be alone in a room with your s.o. Before marriage so nothing could possibly happen. Holding hands and short hugs were allowed when engaged. 

So if you grew up there, find a boyfriend and get engaged as fast as possible (because if you ""fall in love"" it must be gods plan) because you wanna f*ck, and then marry as fast possible (you had to be together at least a year and then be engaged for at least half a year) to have your first kiss ever (if you weren't sinful) I front of everybody when the pastor says: you may kiss the bride. 

We were taught that god wants us to be pure and learn to value our partner's personality. 
They told us girls that if we had a sexual relationship before marriage you would never know if he really loves you or just wants your body. And that every guy outside church would never love us for our personalities.

Another contradiction. These young adults rush into marriage not because they think ""wow I really value my partner as a person"". 
No, they're s*x-driven teenagers lying to themselves (which is absolutely not their fault of course). 

No one is appreciating anything. 
And if they are, they're VERY lucky. 

Because there were maybe 15 people in your age range that you could end up with. 

Girls were also taught to save themselves because we are like chewing gum. 
And if you're all chewed up, your godly future husband wouldn't want you, wouldn't he? 

We were told we were pure glasses of water. 
And if we sleep around before marriage, or even with only one person, every time dirt would fall into our pure water. And no one wants to drink dirty water. 

But the one thing that stuck with me that my mother (and later on more older women) told me was: every time you sleep with a man, he takes a part of your soul with him. That's why there should be only one guy from the start. 

So that you don't end up losing your soul. The thought of that terrified me to the core and I believed it. 
Now I know it's bullsh*t but it was in my head constantly for 5-6 years. 

We were told to cover up so guys don't sin with their eyes and thoughts. Knee-length skirts and shorts were allowed (and I always hated how they looked on me) and you had to cover your belly and your shoulders at all cost. Cleavage was obviously not allowed and so weren't tight clothes (only skinny jeans, not leggings). Especially when you had a little bit more chest. 

And if you dared to show a little tiny bit of skin (no matter how hot summer was) even if it was accidental, you'd get in trouble for it.

I was in that godforsaken building almost everyday. Except for Wednesdays where we would meet up with our local little group of girls (there was a leader a few years older then us and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] mine wasn't as controlling as others and didn't force me too much to work in different groups in church) and discuss what our beloved (I could vomit remembering him and his sleazy and narcissistic behavior) pastor taught us last Sunday. 

I was involved in worship (and my love for singing kind of saved me because that's the only thing I really did because I myself wanted it) I danced (which was ok it was workout for me and not dancing for god when I think about it) I looked after toddlers once month during service (with other women) I was in the theater group and when there was an event for teenagers I was responsible for leading a group of other teenagers to organize it so everything was done and standing where it belongs (I liked organizing, so I was lucky they just positioned me there but it still was hella stressful). And I played the piano(which I didn't really enjoy). 

So there are the Basics. I was heavily involved. 

With 12 you move from being with children to the ""big"" service and you're finally old enough to be part of all the cool things the teenagers did. 

But then you're also constantly stressed out which worsened every year because obviously school got harder, but also church demanded more and more and suddenly you were thrown into highly responsible tasks which drained you. 

When I was 14 I started to constantly have headaches. I started drinking coffee because I was exhausted of not being able to sleep, being stressed out and constantly worried that someone would find out my secrets. (And now I need a very strong one for it to ""work"".)

Because in school I was someone else. I had a different name in school (my real name). In church the pastor required my parents to introduce me with a very far away nickname from my real name because it sounded like a name in the Bible that an evil person had and if I'd be called that it would curse me. 

I did and said what I wanted (it increased gradually because I still tried to be ""myself"", which you could be in church (no),  in school but obviously couldn't do that, because no one can ). 

I thought I was being myself I school and maybe that was ""myself"" when I was 14 but I still was the most severe case of a people pleaser. 

And I always endet up in dependent toxic friendships because I could never say anything against them. I had no one else who was close to me. So that also hurt me even though I didn't notice at the time. 

People abused my kindness, because in church they told us we had to be nice. And I could do at least that. So I held on to being nice to everyone, helping everyone and inviting people to come to church who were remotely close to me. Which still embarrasses me the most, but you get in trouble when you're not inviting people. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] glad I was in a very accepting class. No one was ever really bullied, just mocked for a few things, maybe. 
Which I was for being in that ""church"". 
And they told me early on: it's a cult, you believe in crazy sh*t, stop going there. 
But we were taught that people who are afraid of the truth always say that. 

School was kind of a safe place for me, even if I had toxic friendships and got hurt a few times, because we live about 25 kilometers away from church (the cult lol) and no one I knew from there could see me. 
And even though we were taught that god could see EVERYTHING and is always reading our thoughts I didn't feel very watched (I was scared sh*tless when I wore something in school we weren't allowed to wear in church and I thought I saw someone I knew) so I felt better in school then at home. 

And that's why my definition of ""home"" is something entirely different then that of people who grew up in an emotionally safe home. 

So what was living in my ""home"" like? 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] first daughter of three and therefore my fathers precious first born. I learned really fast that just keeping quiet, smiling and doing what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] is the best way to avoid any more stressful situations. I hated every form of confrontation and I still do.

When I was as young as 3 my father threatened to hit me with a belt (and did it a few times) but I stopped misbehaving or questioning so no one yelled at me anymore and no one told me to stand in a corner without looking around. 

So I just learned to not show my emotions at all at ""home"". Because emotions cause trouble and distress. They also told us that. God and our own intellect (which is controlled by god) must lead us. Emotions come out because of the devil. 

My father was in control of everything and to this day he's still extremely, s*xist, r*cist, homophobic, transphobic etc. You name it. 
And he still thinks I have exactly the same opinions as him. 

He is very critical of my boyfriend, but because he puts on a facade in front of my father as I do my father likes him. 

My parents (more my father) still don't want me to have anything premarital, even though they are less strict then before. So yeah I can't ask for birth control because then they would not let me see my bf. 

As I said my father is very controlling and has a very high opinion of himself. Because he is providing for our family he doesn't have to do anything regarding the house. This is on the woman and the four girls in his house, because that's what god made us for. 

Popping out babies, cleaning und cooking. 

But I still have to have a degree and a high paying job. 

And then I ask myself: what do you want from me? What? 

In church we learned that you have to find a job that gives you enough time to be as active as possible in church while giving birth to as many children as possible and managing your whole household completely alone. 

Because your husband is by god's law above you and there to ""lead"" you. How remarkably generous of you to lead me, because I can't decide on anything ever due to always thinking I don't have control anyways. 

That's why I need to plan everything obsessively and always know and control what's going on.

I idolized my father until the realization that we don't have any emotional bond slowly reached me until it hit me hard. 

I had to organize my phone a certain way and delete massages so in case he would want to go through it he wouldn't find anything. 

He wanted me to be his perfect show-daughter who has good marks and serves god with all of her existence. And he really did that. 
In front of him I am [REDACTED_NAME] he wants me to be. 

I don't know what my mother wants. She just does what my father tells her and silently agrees to what he has to say. Maybe I learned to behave in that way because she did. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sorry for her because she never had a chance to study anything that could make her independent, because of moving to Germany with 17 or 18 and not being able to speak the language very well. 

I could cry, because, no matter how brutal this sounds, her life is over in a way. She is what I never want to be. 

Whenever they told us how our future will look like I had a kind of panic that I never felt before. At the time I suppressed that but when I think back my heart rate goes up and I feel like I need to run as fast as I can. 

And that's why I hate to be dependent on someone. But weirdly I still end up in situations where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] dependent. 

Another thing that I can maybe explain now is my reaction to my grandfathers death (he was more of a father to me then my own and his and his wife's home (which I also deeply loved) felt safe). 

When I was 11 years old my grandmother (my grandfathers wife) passed away because of cancer. And I was never allowed to see her while she was sick nor to attend the funeral. 

And in that time I already saw my grandpa rarely. When my parents told me my grandma passed away I cried one time.

I know that I was sad but I somehow can't really recall my immediate emotions from that day. 

And I thought I'm [REDACTED_NAME] that I still have my grandpa. But he passed away three months later. And I wasn't able to see him during these months. When my father (emotionlessly) told us that his father also passed away I felt nothing. I didn't cry. No reaction at all. And then I didn't think about it for years. 

But when I was 14 all of the sudden all of the emotions I should have felt when I was 11 crushed me harder then anything ever. 

It was like reliving the day I was told he was gone for ever for almost a year. And I was so confused. Why now? Why didn't I feel anything back then? Because my brain was already way to stressed for an 11 year old and just didn't process properly. 

Then three years later something triggered my memories and the horrors began. 

When I was 16 it hit me again because I found out he committed s*icide (through my cousin). 

Back to the cult. 
So am I still there? No. 

My parents realized how manipulative literally everything about it was and without telling anyone there (childhood friends I grew up with included) we went there one last time and on Sunday the 23rd September [REDACTED_ADDRESS]ove away and never came back. 

And many others left too. 
We still meet every Sunday and I still sing there, because I don't want to confront my parents.
 
I really don't want to be there because every time we're there I'm [REDACTED_NAME] really there. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] a shell that moves around. During the preaching (which a few men do in turns) I'm [REDACTED_NAME] completely zoned out and can only concentrate for a bit if I really really try. 

I don't know what that is or that means but I absolutely hate it because I can't control it. 

And sometimes I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sad for no reason, I still can't sleep and still get a massive headache and can't stand up properly without strong coffee. I still eat too much stuff really shouldn't and I feel bad for every little bit I eat. But I can't stop. 

And it also affects all of my relationships, especially with my bf. He sometimes doesn't understand but he still comforts me and is patient which I am [REDACTED_NAME] grateful for. 

And something that comes to my mind only now is that my father used to completely lose it when I had a bad mark. I was afraid to come home and always started crying before even telling him. And then he would shout even more, beat the table with his fist and tell me to stop crying. 

Now I can control if I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to cry or not when something upsets me. And if I want to show my emotions or not. Being a very good liar was essential and it still is.

When my father is mad at me because I didn't do the dishes he still gets very impulsive and shames me because if he works and gives me food and clothing it's disrespectful to leave the dishes for too long. And when he stands beside me and doesn't stop while I do the dishes I just nod my head and say yes. It's the only way to avoid more pain at all costs. 

There are these moments but also the ones where he tries to talk to me and asks me how I am [REDACTED_NAME] then he tells me how he loves his first born princess. He tells that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] best daughter someone could have and that he's so so proud of me. And I just smile at him and say thank you. 

But on the inside I think: ""if you knew who I really am and what I did that you don't of, you wouldn't talk to me anymore"". 

He is proud of the daughter he created for himself that I still am in front of him. 

My mother also tries to get closer to me after 16 years of distance and letting the church raise us. And the only thing that I would tell her, if I was honest for a few seconds in the midst of all the lies I protect myself with is: ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] but it's too late."" 

I don't have any emotional connection to my parents and I never had. 

The first 16 years of my life partly wasted. 
I feel like someone took my childhood from me. Even my memories are blurry. 
And I know it's technically not my parents fault but I want to blame them so badly. 

And it makes me so mad that I was born because of the ""church"". Because they convinced my father to have children. 
I was cursed before I even existed. 

And still. 

I can recall a few beautiful memories of things I did with my friends there. The sleepovers, summer camp, singing together, playing hide and seek in the big building. 

All of us connected through our fear of the dangerous outside world and hell. 

There is no moment in my life where I wasn't afraid that some adult could dream, or feel( they taught us that god can reveal things about people to you when you have strong connection to the holy spirit) that I  was a dirty sinner that acted differently in school.

And it was so frightening, because when it's out that you messed up you can't attend certain rituals( like the holy communion) and that's when people know. They see that you're not taking part in it and the first thing that comes to mind is of course ""premarital s*x!!!"" 

When a couple did it (and someone found out) it's made sure by the authorities that in a week everyone knows. 

And I wanted to avoid people thinking that at all costs so was very aware and on guard all the time.

 I made sure I had a different app also open while watching vampire diaries on my phone because there you can switch faster so my father or my mother (who still just burst into my room whenever they want to) would never know I would watch something the devil created.

 My parents and everyone in church who was ""responsible"" for me always tried to shelter me and get anything with a ""bad influence"" away from me. 

But I still watched what I wasn't allowed to. The internet and myself raised me when my beliefs started to break away. People like Jenna Marbles taught me things parents should teach their kids. I educated myself on so much stuff I missed out on and started to build my own opinions and morals from 14-16. 

Basic knowledge like: it's okay to not believe what your parents believe was so new to me.
 
And now? I just want to move out and study something so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] safe. I can't wait for the day where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to be financially independent and don't have to rely on my father.

Wow it feels good put all of that in words. 

When you read until now you must be really really bored, but thank you. I appreciate your attention greatly. 

I just wish I could get help.


update: I told my parents, because I realized I couldn't wait any longer (I was stubborn). 
So now i'm [REDACTED_NAME] to therapy. 
Thank you for everyone who commented. It made me feel less alone :)",6
d24lsj,1568103546.0,2019-09-10 08:19:06,stories,I hate my growths,"

I wanted to put my story out there, in hopes of possibly helping someone else. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] there's at least a few people out there like me.


It all started when I was a kid. My mother died in childbirth, and my father raised my brother and I. We lived in a small town, but lived a good distance away, so we pretty much stayed close to home.  My brother and the other neighborhood kids played in the woods and creek by our house. I thought life would always be happy and carefree.....


I first noticed them when I was 9. I was getting ready for school that morning and I happened to see it in the mirrors reflection. I was confused, but I wasn't scared, yet.. 

I just kept thinking it would go away. Probably a bug bite or something like it, and it would heal on its own. It wasn't big enough to be seen through my clothing, so I didn't bother mentioning it to dad. 

I tried to push it from my mind, and being 9, it wasn't too hard to get lost in school work, and after school play. It wasn't as if I had forgotten about it. But I didn't constantly worry about it either. 

It wasn't until a few weeks after my 11th birthday that panic really set in. 



I was playing with my brother in the creek, when I happened to notice a slight feeling…  as if something was moving on my skin. I looked down, pulling my shirt out a bit, thinking a bug or some animal had gotten in there somehow, when I saw them.  I nearly screamed. Instead of just a tiny one, now there were two. And they were larger. Much larger than before, as if they had grown overnight. My brother must have noticed my reaction, and came over to check on me. I quickly covered my growths - that's what I'd begun to think of them as - and we went home, me trying to hide my secret the entire way. 



For the next month I avoided wearing tight fitting clothes, and stayed to myself as much as possible.

But I knew the problem wasn't going to get better, not on its own. I would have to tell my father. I planned to tell him one night after dinner. But the words were stuck in my throat. 

I helped him clear the table, waiting for the right moment. I waited until my brother took the dogs outside, and then as my father washed and I dried, I told him. I still remember the look on his face. He had been washing the salad bowl, and at the moment I said the words he nearly dropped it. My fear suddenly became overwhelming. Fathers weren't supposed to be scared. He  must have seen my reaction and set the bowl in the sink, and knelt in front of me. 


""It's ok. Don't worry about anything."" He said, and he smiled but it wasn't like his normal smiles. It was the same smile he had when he told my brother and I our dog, champ died and would be in heaven with Mom. 


""But .. they got bigger. What if they keep growing?"" I asked in a scared voice. ""Am I gonna die?"" 


Tears started falling then. He hugged me tight, and after a moment he said, ""Of course not. We'll take you to see the doctor. Maybe tomorrow if he's able. Don't worry."" 


I felt better that night. It was finally out in the open. It wasn't my secret to hide anymore. We did go see doctor Hadley. He was about 100 in my 11 year old mind, but was probably more like 65. He had gray hair and gray eyebrows that always reminded me of the caterpillars I used to find in our garden. He smelled like peppermint toothpaste, and the stinging smell of alcohol, that reminded me of the shots he gave. My father left the room when it was time to show the doctor my growths. It was like he was embarrassed by them, or afraid he'd catch them….. 


The doctor only looked for a second. Then quickly looked up at me, his eyes worried like my fathers had been. Had they grown? My panicked mind raced. I couldn't be sure. The doctor tried to smile, but even at 11 I knew when someone was pretending. 


""What's wrong?"" I had asked him. My blood pounded in my ears. He cleared his throat, and went into a long speech mainly consisting of medical jargon that I didn't fully comprehend. When he finished and asked if I understood I nodded, but I really only understood one thing. 

Untreatable. No cure. No way to stop it. And according to doctor Hadley, the growths would most likely continue to grow. I ran from his office, tears staining my face, my father running after me. I didn't eat that night. Or the next morning. My father tried to talk to me, but I heard nothing. I was going to be a freak. Forever. 

I begged my father to let me stay home, but he refused. I rarely left the house except for school, and always wore loose fitting clothes. 

The kids didn't seem to notice, at least until one day during break. Mr Bolger let us go outside to play kickball after Math, and I was completely into the game, forgetting my growths, when Franky ran into me knocking me down on my back. It knocked the wind right out of me, and I lay there on the grass trying to force air into my lungs. When I finally began to breathe normally I opened my eyes to see Franky and the others standing over me, their eyes like saucers. I looked down at myself and felt the air sucked from my lungs for the second time. My shirt was ripped and a growth was clearly visible. 


I struggled to cover it, and get to my feet. ""Holy shit"" Franky said, his voice low so Mr Bolger didn't hear. The others joined in, some laughing, some just staring at me with open mouths. I guess I can't blame them, looking back. But at the time I was furious. I ran as fast as I could, their hollering, and laughter following me. I didn't stop even when Mr Bolger called after me. I didn't stop until I was too far away to hear the laughter. 


The years went by with me keeping to myself. I rarely went anywhere except school, and when I left the house I was well covered, even in summer. I got used to the staring, laughing, pointing. 

I just pretended I couldn't hear them. 


When I moved away for college I hadn't been happier. I didn't have to share a room with anyone, thankfully. I still avoided friends, opting to keep to myself. 

I had access to computers at the school library, and spent all my free time searching for cures or treatments, and talking to people like me in support groups. Some had their growths in other places, growths that looked much different than mine. Those people became my true friends. They also helped me find a doctor who could remove the growths. 

I met the doctor one morning, and was so excited I barely slept the night before. 


But unfortunately he looked at the growths - which had grown considerably since I was 11 - and said he wouldn't be able to perform the surgery unless they were causing health problems. He gave me a useless referral to see another doctor, and sent me on my way. I never went to see the other doctor. I came to realize that no one could help me. 

If I wanted to be normal and growth free, I'd have to help myself. 


And that brings me to now. I locked myself in my room with a few supplies. One of my friends from the support groups sent me instructions on how to remove the growths myself. He did it a few years prior and said it worked wonderfully. He warned me about the possible dangers, and of course, the pain. But I wouldn't be swayed. 

I got all the supplies listed, and locked the door in case I screamed too loud. 

I put a few trash bags  on the floor to stand on to catch any blood, and pressed the sharpened knife to the growth, sawing through it. I'll admit, it took a good while to get started, but it didn't take long to realize how much pressure I'd need. 

I bit down on a washcloth, but despite the warnings of pain, all I really felt was relief. Relief and excitement. 


There was some pain, and more blood than I imagined. But when that hideous growth fell to the floor all I felt was pure joy. 


I'm [REDACTED_NAME] bleeding pretty bad, and nearly loss consciousness twice so I had to stop before starting the other one.

But I wanted to write this while I wait, for anyone out there like me who thought they were doomed to live life with their growths, their dark secret.

It's possible to find a cure. You just need to want it bad enough, and a sharp knife. You'll also need a lot of towels to stop the blood. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] on my sixth one.


I have to go now. I may need to take a nap before I start the last one.. I feel dizzy, but it's all worth it. Remember, you're not alone. And despite what doctors say, the growths can be stopped. I smile when I think back to Dr Hadley telling me I'd have the growths forever. He even tried to tell me my growths were normal. Except he used medical terminology, and called them ""breasts"" 

But whatever the term, my growths are nearly gone. I just pray they won't grow back...",55

The airport was super crowded and every outlet was taken. People were basically guarding their chargers like their lives depended on it.

I noticed this woman nearby who looked pretty stressed. She kept checking her phone and you could tell it was about to die. I had my power bank with me and, for once, it was actually charged. So I just handed it to her and said, “Hey, you can use this if you want.”

She looked at me like I just handed her a winning lottery ticket. Are you serious? yeah go for it I said.

While her phone charged, we started talking. She had just come from a job interview and was heading home. Told me she hadn’t worked in over a year and wasn’t sure if she was still cut out for it. I told her she totally was. We ended up chatting for like half an hour before I had to board. She gave me back the charger, thanked me a bunch, and that was it.

Then last week, I went to this local networking thing I almost skipped. Halfway through, someone taps me on the shoulder and says, I don’t know if you remember me, but you let me borrow a charger in Denver.

It was her. Same smile, but now she seemed way more confident. She told me she got the job, moved to a new city, and everything kind of turned around after that. She said that little moment stuck with her not because of the charger, but because it reminded her that people still care. That someone saw her and believed in her.

We talked for another hour. Now she’s mentoring other women who are getting back into work and honestly she just seemed really happy.

It’s wild how something so small turned into something that big. You really never know what a little kindness can lead to.

And for me, that moment changed how I move through the world too. I started paying more attention to people around me. Being a little more open. A little more willing to pause and connect. I never used to think small gestures mattered that much but now I get it. They really can echo.",45937
fwgvet,1586248186.0,2020-04-07 08:29:46,stories,A friend died a few years ago... Here's our story.,"Content warming: This post contains talk of Suicide, death and divorce, so if that's not your thing, click away please.   


(Hopefully this doesn't count as a wall of text, it's just all I could think was important to the story, and being a true story everything comes back to a certain moment)

It's been over 5 years now since I lost a close friend, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure where else to tell the story, but I've been wanting to for some time now.   
\----------------------------------------------------

When I was in highschool my parents divorced, my step father kept his house, and my mother along with me and my brother moved out. We found an apartment in a new city, but our lives had changed quite a bit. New school, new home, and biggest of all new friends. It was a big change for me, but I saw it as a chance for a new life. I was never the most popular person but this was my chance to change things!  


 I signed up for the School's Theatre program as part of my starting classes and fell in love right away. Everyone seemed so nice, and I loved being able to do something relating to acting. I'd wanted to do acting and singing since I was a young kid, and this was my chance! So, I signed up for a play... It was our school's rendition of Addams Family and to my shock... I got a pretty big roll, being the understudy of one of the main cast, getting 2-3 shows of my own. I was thrilled, so I did everything I could relating to theatre. This included going to a special showing my town was doing of Les  Misérables. I wasn't familiar with it, so I opted to go.  


As I was signing up to go see the show(I believe it was extra credit as well) A girl approached me, asking if she could have a ride home after the show, since her family didn't have a ride. I said I'd call my mother and see what we could do, I asked for her number and name, We'll call her Winona and  we were off. Little did I know that would be the single biggest decision I'd make in my entire life.

We showed up early to be first in line and with hours to kill so she decided to teach me a card game she was fond of, Muchkins I believe it was called, and we played that, sang karaoke and did all kind of goofy things for the 2-3 hours it took for them to open the doors to everyone. I remember her telling me about her long distance boyfriend who she was having some issues with, and all about some minor personal things in her life. We chatted sharing stories before the doors opened and she introduced me to a friend of hers, we'll call the friend Meghan, and we were off to the seats.  


Winona sat on one side of me, Meghan on the other and the show began. I was rather impressed by the whole thing kind of locked in before I felt someone grab my hand... Winona for some reason was holding my hand. I can't explain to you how awkward I felt, knowing 1, she had a boyfriend and 2, that I had known her for all of 2 hours. But I didn't tell her, I just let her hold my hand until she eventually pulled it away, and told her friend it was her turn. It was some joke, and I played along with it which she was so excited to see that I did. She was very excited that night. She saw a play with a fairly famous internet personality in it, she met a new person, and she even caught pieces of paper that a main character tears up and tosses into the audience. It was incredible. When it was over we took a picture with everyone, and my mother and I took her home.   


Winona, me, and Meghan formed a fairly close friendship over the next year, countless inside jokes, and fun things done together. Me and Meghan even had a short lived romantic thing, broke it off and stayed friends. It was really a unique kind of friendship given I was the guy who did a lot of these ""feminine"" things with them. They did my makeup, went to costume parties, did all kind of goofy things, and just had a good time...  


I remember Winona's birthday like it was yesterday... Meghan had made Winona a birthday snack, but she was so late for school we didn't get to enjoy her there. I still save the messages asking where she was at the time. She said her bus was late and would be there soon. With hindsight, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] so sure what to think.  


3 months later and Winona was looking different at school... Distant, but I just assumed it was a bad day at school, and that it'd be better once the weekend had passed. It haunts me every single day knowing I didn't say anything to her. I saw her... I knew she was distressed or upset or something and I chose not to say anything. She walked away from the friend group, me and her boyfriend were the only ones there, we both thought it seemed strange, but didn't really convey that. I went home, thought nothing of it, excited for the weekend and assumed it'd be all dandy the next few days.  


I woke up late saturday night, probably around 8pm to a voicemail. I'd stayed up the night before playing video games, or watching youtube, something to pass the time. I never even bothered checking my messages the night before. So when I woke up to a voice mail on Saturday it was strange. No one ever called me so I felt some weird ominousness from it.   
I listened to it groggily only to be met with Meghan's voice.   
""Hey \*REAL NAME\* it's Meghan, call me back when you get this. Um... She- Winona's dead... She killed herself yesterday, and I felt it was rude to tell you over text... So, I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Call me back, bye."" 

I was in a bit of shock. I couldn't believe it. I wasn't sad, and Meghan's voice sounded so normal... It was a bad joke. That's all... Right? I tried to believe that.   


Sunday passed and the news hadn't really hit me. I played Halo, and just went on as normal, sure it wasn't real. Then I got a message about wearing black to school, and a friend was making ribbons. Still... It wasn't real. It couldn't be real.   


I showed up in black, half to humor it and half to keep up my own lie. I'd play along, and when she jumped out I'd say how I knew it was a prank, and that it was a good one.   


Instead I was met with somber faces of everyone who knew her standing around outside the school waiting for me... Black outfits, and messy hair... It seemed 15+ people were there, from theatre people, old friends who'd grown distant, just about everyone who had a relationship with her.   


I got my ribbon.  
A thin purple strip of fabric, Her favorite color. Then we all got called into the crying room. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure what this room is technically called, I believe it was a room they held meetings in, a long table with about 20 chairs. But we weren't there for that... We were supposed to be here to talk about Winona. Share stories, just do stuff to take our mind off of having to be at school so we could remember her. I felt a weight in my chest that I hadn't before... Everyone looked as shocked as I was... Then the announcements came on over the speakers. Normal, every day school news, followed by a moment of silence for Winona. Half of the heads in the room hit the table at the same time, including mine. everyone realizing it was real was horrifying. The sound of sobs was haunting... I could feel everyone trying to comfort everyone while having no idea how.  


I left school early that day. I walked to the office and said I was leaving, they just let me go, saying sorry.   
As I left I kept looking back hoping to see her jump out saying that it was all just a dark joke.  
I walked down a mile or two to a local place where we used to hang out and just cried. I cried and cried. A server who recognized me sat there too, trying go comfort me, but I don't think I could.   


My mother picked me up and I cried the whole way home. I cried even more at home. I spent hours just scrolling through old facebook photos, our time during the show, our time doing 1 shots, her old singing videos. The entire time my mother just held me tight, I feel so thankful for her being there... I cried until tears just couldn't come anymore, then I screamed... I didn't recover for a while... The next few weeks are a blur... I couldn't taste food, I didn't want to eat, I just remember feeling so empty and sad... Eventually the sadness went away and I was left just empty for a while. I'd occasionally see someone on the street who looked vaguely like her, or peak around a corner to see if she was there, always met with disappointment. Through the process me and Meghan got back together for another few months, probably out of grief and wanting something to comfort us more than anything. I think that helped a lot for a while. I was learning to smile again, and on the right track. Me and Meghan broke up and life went on. All kind of things went on. But I can't forget her.   


5 years later I still find myself occasionally hoping to see her, even after her vigil, and seeing her urn. Part of me still hates accepting that she's gone. Seeing everything to do with her is bittersweet... 

And recently my old facebook was deleted so I don't even have our old messages. I keep that phone though, and the voicemail. I have both backed up multiple times.  


I still write to her a lot. I use the description of the voice mail saving almost as a diary to write about whenever I think of her.   
I hate that she can't see what's happened to all of us, I hate that she never got to do her dream role... I hate that she's never seen me after I came out, I hate that I never told her how much she mattered, or even gave her one last hug. I hate that she died older than me, and now she's stuck at 17 while I grow older.   


I can't remember my last words to her, and I don't know why it breaks my heart so much.  As awkward as it was the first time, I wish I could just hold her hand again and tell her how much she means to me.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway that's my story I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my secondary account because I don't want my real account flooded with anything, nor do I want karma or anything from this.   


I just wanted to tell our story, especially since I thought about her a lot tonight.  
And to let anyone know that if you're not doing great, I'd be happy to talk to you. I'd hate being able to do something and not for the second time. Please, if you're considering anything like this, give me a message and I'll try to get back to everyone.",90

We decided last minute to go to PF Chang's on a Friday night. It was slammed, we had to wait almost an hour to be seated and when we finally were we were placed in an area that had a long bench along a wall with multiple tables and chairs on the other side of those tables. 

I was sitting on the bench side next to a rather large person that was already eating and I was on the side of their arm they were using so I had to scoot further to my right. I was basically rubbing elbows with a very attractive and well dressed young woman. Opposite her was her date. A very nervous young man that was trying desperately to make conversation. They both had their food already and she hadn't even touched her plate and was looking at her phone. 

Her date either had a stutter or was so nervous he kept stammering and attempting to bring up anything only to be met with absolutely nothing but silence from her. Eventually I decide to kinda peer over at her phone right as she's ordering herself an Uber. She gets up without saying a word and leaves.

As she walked past him he asked if she was going to the restroom and she still says nothing. The hurt I saw in this man's eyes. I could tell he was hoping she was maybe going to the bathroom and would come back but as the minutes ticked by the embarrassment crept in, he looked around nervously for a server so he could pay and that's when I noticed he was fighting back tears. His face was red and his hands were shaking when he got his wallet out. As an observer it felt like a millennia for the server to come back with his card. He struggled to put his card in his wallet and eventually gave up just shoving both in his pocket and left. 

We saw a Criss Angel show afterwards and it was very underwhelming.",638

While my classmates were polishing résumés and stressing over interviews, my parents sat me down and made it clear: I wouldn’t be job hunting. I’d be working for them.

They run a massive waste management company like, city-wide contracts, fleet of trucks, recycling centers, the whole deal. It’s their legacy, and they want me to take over someday. But they also made it clear I wouldn’t be jumping into some cushy office role with a fancy title. If I was going to lead the company, I had to understand it from the ground up.

Fair enough. I actually respected that.

So I started at the very bottom. One day I was on a truck hauling trash bins in the rain, the next I was elbow-deep in recyclables at the sorting center. I never told anyone who I was. I wore the same uniform, followed the same schedule, and showed up like every other new guy. I wanted real experience. No special treatment, no shortcuts.

At first, it was fine. Humbling, even. I started to respect the people who do this every day in ways I couldn’t before. They’re tough. They work hard. But after a while, the vibe started to shift. I was doing more and more of the grunt work while others kicked back. I was told to straighten out the bins, clean up after others, do the “new guy” stuff constantly.

I didn’t complain. I kept my head down. I figured it was part of paying dues.

But then came the day that broke me.

It was raining hard, and we were already short staffed. I barely slept the night before, showed up exhausted, and got drenched within the first hour. My clothes were soaked. I was cold and running on fumes. Still, I pushed through most of the shift until one of the senior guys, Ron, decided he was done.

He dumped the rest of his tasks on me and said, “You’re the new guy, you handle it. I gotta leave early.”

I snapped. Politely, but firmly, I told him no I wasn’t doing his work. I was done letting people pile on just because they outranked me.

He stared at me like I’d grown a second head. Then, with a smirk, he said, “Careful. Management might not like it if I start talking about your attitude.”

I looked him dead in the eye and said, “Then let’s go to management right now.”

He blinked. Didn’t say another word. Just walked off.

That was the first time I’ve ever stood up for myself like that at work. I didn’t play the 'I’m the owner's son' card. I still haven’t. But I’m starting to realize: being the boss’s kid doesn’t mean I have to accept being walked over to prove I’m humble.

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to learn not to be everyone’s personal doormat.",31430

I (29 at the time) had gone to IKEA on a Sunday afternoon aka chaos hour. I was just looking for a stupid desk lamp, but IKEA being IKEA, I ended up wandering around like I was in Narnia.

Anyway, I’m in the kitchen section when I overhear a couple arguing about what kind of plates to get. Not just, “I like this one better,” but a full-on relationship crisis disguised as dinnerware shopping.

The guy says something like, “We always do what *you* want, why are we even here?” and the girl replies, “Because you never make decisions!” Classic stuff.

Now here’s where I become the accidental villain.

I walk by them and spot the exact lamp I’ve been hunting for in someone’s abandoned cart nearby. I point and say, “Sorry, do you know where that lamp is from?” But apparently, that cart belonged to the guy in the couple. He snaps, “I don’t know, just take it!” and storms off.

The girl looks at me, goes, “Seriously?” and then follows him while muttering something like, “Can’t even buy f\*\*\*ing plates without drama.”

I felt like a background character who just delivered the line that ruined a whole subplot. I left with the lamp feeling like I had triggered a breakup.

To this day, I wonder:  
Did they make up in the parking lot?  
Did she throw a dinner plate at him later?  
Did I accidentally do her a favor?

r6z4mi,1638420472.0,2021-12-02 04:47:52,stories,Children of the storm.,"Right now I remembered a conversation I had five years ago when I was a camp counselor in the USA, my best job experience so far even though I worked 24/6, couldn't drink, my crush got sent back home on session three, man I missed her a lot, and I couldn't say goodbye to her because I was standing guard and no one wanted to switch, I had to clean pipes, and scrub crap from the floor. 

How come it was so good? How come I enjoyed it so much?

Anyway, I was at the sportsfield one day, and a storm came, thunder, lightning, small, nothing out of the ordinary, the rain was mild, the thunders were quite weak, and the lightning...meh, or so I thought.

In the middle of the sportsfield, hidden whithin the shed we used to store all the equipment, to where I was going to store our mats in which we had practiced some judo throws with the kids that I sent on their way to safety, I found  Aadhya, an Indian counselor, curled in the floor, grabbing her knees, sobbing and from time to time covering her ears to avoid the sounds of the storm I am [REDACTED_NAME] fond of.

""What's wrong?""- I asked, not realizing she was terrified of the weather.

""I am [REDACTED_NAME] of thunderstorms, and this is one of the largest I have ever seen, they said it was going to be the storm of the decade in the weather forecast""- She answered.

And I felt two things I remember, one, tenderness, to see someone whom I thought so outgoing and daring being reduced to a childlike state gave me the urge to hug her, she was like a child who has seen the dark for the first time and runs to her father's arms in search for safety.

The second one was confusion, this was a small storm, mild if I am [REDACTED_NAME] generous, nothing compared to the average thunderstorm from where I come from, and then it hit me, my home province, down there, in Argentina, has been deemed as the place with the worst thunderstorms in the world, violent, lasting, hail the size of tiny fists knocking glass, blunting metal, cracking tiles of roofs and the skulls of the unaware, and thunder that lasts for hours.

""Why are you not afraid"" She asked.

""Because I am [REDACTED_NAME] my friend, from where  I come from this is but a mere rainy day where you still play football in the fields and we still go out to party if it is indoors""- And as I sat down next to her I continued my story- ""Were I am [REDACTED_NAME] the storms last hours if not days, they come as they please and no one can tame them, we carry them whithin, a thunderstorm is a sign of a night with pleasant sleep if you have a roof over your head and don't have crops to worry about

We are accustomed to this weather because this weather is somehow part of what makes us unique, we are the heart of Argentina and our weather in a way symbolizes the nature of our nation, and although we are far from the capitol, we believe we are the true spirit of the nation, and we try to embody its values, loyalty, kindness, friendship, optimism, and resilience, the storm outside can not be tamed, but the storm we carry whithin is a journey of a lifetime, after all, what are Cordobessians if not children of the storm?""

And we sat down until she felt brave enough to grab my skinny arm and walk to the dinning hall.

On a spot: Feel free to read about our weather in Google there's a New York Time's article that rules.",3
191cace,1704687530.0,2024-01-08 04:18:50,stories,I flashed a group of girls when I was 13,"I lived in an upstairs apartment and I had a big window in my bedroom that was very visible to others when passing by. I usually had a cover hung up over the window, but I think it might have been in the washer? I can't remember exactly. One day I was up there and had just got back from school.. I was switching from jeans into some shorts and then I noticed 3 girls that looked to have been 15-17 were walking past our apartment. I had the dumb idea to whip my penis out of my boxers and wiggle it around right in front of the window.. I don't know why I did it. I guess I thought that it would be funny? They looked pretty grossed out and just walked away awkwardly. 

A few hrs later my mom answered the door to one of the girls mothers and she had told her what I did.. I was then forced to give an apology to the girls face to face. It was easily the most humiliating moment of my life. After they left I got a belt whooping from  my dad and he took away my Xbox for like a whole month.. My parents didn't stop there either, my mom suggested that they put me in therapy because what I had done was a potential indication of future behavior. I went for like a year and I think it was good for me. I'm 21 now and my dad still mentions it from time to time to try and embarrass me. Just thought I'd share this not very proud moment of mine.",1206
ocvv0i,1625309781.0,2021-07-03 10:56:21,stories,Gullible,"Ever since grade three, my friends and I could make Derek Zimmer believe anything. *Anything*. From Pop-Rocks and Coke make your stomach explode; to earwigs actually burrow in your ears (and one’s on your shoulder right now!); to the typical urban legend of the babysitter and the killer upstairs – and that it actually happened to someone in our neighbourhood.

The best prank we pulled on Derek had to be in grade 6, when we told him that everyone had to go into the girl’s bathroom to change because a toilet had overflowed in the boy’s. This was during gym class too and in our school the bathrooms doubled as change rooms. Geez, he didn’t even question it – didn’t even wait to see us go in first. We followed right behind him while he carried his spare set of clothes with a towel over his shoulder. We didn’t even need to shove him in; he just walked through the door and we locked it behind him and from then on there was nothing but hollering and shrieking from the other side. I got to admit, I still get tickled thinking about it.

After grade seven it stopped being funny – pulling fast ones on him all the time. But, like a bad habit, we kept feeding him lies and watching him fall for them over and over again.

I guess it didn’t help that he had sheltering, hovercraft parents. I mean, the guy believed in Santa Clause until he was thirteen, for Christ’s sake! And they kept walking him to school even though he lived literally just up the street. It wasn’t until Derek begged them, after being tortured by our sneers and jeers, that they finally stopped.

You’d think that they’d have tried to protect him by teaching him not to believe everything he was told. But I guess since they did everything for him, he just always needed someone else to make up his mind.

I don’t want you to get the impression that Derek was slow or something. He was actually a pretty bright kid. He wasn’t top of the class or nothing – and his math and science marks were pathetically low. But, if you spent time with him, you’d see he was actually very insightful, especially when it came to abstract stuff like morality and friendship and artsy stuff too. Oh yes, I was friends with Derek, even though I constantly tricked and made fun of him. Yeah…I was one of *those* friends. He would actually analyze our favourite TV shows, comparing the ones he liked and the ones he didn’t and go into really meticulous detail about why some were good, and some were bad. What made a joke funny and what didn’t.

At the time, even though I liked talking with him, I kind of thought that all this information was pretty useless – I mean, I just watched shows, movies and played video games for fun, not to write a goddamn dissertation. If Derek had any brains, I thought, he’d put more of his energy into his schoolwork. But now, looking back, it makes me wish our school had a Philosophy class or even an Arts program. I think he would have excelled, rather than constantly being stuck getting C’s and D’s. But we grew up in a small, frozen town in northern Ontario that only offered the bare necessities for a diploma. And in a town where most people work in the mines and spend their spare time ice-fishing and playing hockey, Derek stuck out like a sore thumb.

All the teachers seemed to like him, but you could tell they were pretty frustrated by how difficult he found the material. He was also a bit stubborn at times. For instance, you’d think he would have done well in English, right? Wrong. He shined only in the creative writing assignments but didn’t follow instructions and would never read the books that were assigned. The funny thing was, he was a voracious reader, always reading something. He just didn’t want to be bothered reading *Lord of the Flies* or *Of Mice and Men*. He just thought they were a waste of his time.

One thing that Derek excelled at, besides being a very loyal – to a fault – friend, was he was an amazing storyteller. When he got hold of an urban legend, or a dirty joke, or if something happened to him, he would tell it in such a way that we would hang on every word he said. There was no rambling, no “um’s” or “uh’s” – he always took his time and told the story perfectly. The punchline or the ending of his story was always clear and left us howling with laughter, terrified, or desperate to hear more.

More than a few of the stories Derek told us were uncannily frightening – tales of ghosts and creatures in our own hometown. Most of them I could trace back to some origin – usually Alvin Schwartz’s *Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark*. But there were also a few I had never heard of and could not find a source for. Whenever I confronted him with this, he would give me this knowing smile, his light eyes at ease, and say, “There are somethings that can’t be explained.” He would then pontificate about the other world and how everyone was able to access it if they just suspended their prejudices and disbelief. That was how he got “beamed” his stories. At the time, I thought it was bullshit. This was the only thing I had ever known Derek to lie about. Now looking back, I wish I had realized that this honest, gullible boy was incapable of telling falsehoods. And that what he was telling me was something *he* at least believed to be true.

Eventually, I got a bit jealous of Derek; I never had a good memory for details – aside from numbers and figures – and often when I told a joke, I’d forget an important part of the set-up and the punchline would fall flat. Or if I told an anecdote about something that happened to me that I thought was funny or exciting, after I’d finish, the listeners would just stare blankly, their vacant faces tacitly screaming, “That’s it?”

(Believe me, it took me a long time and a lot of effort to write this story as well as I have).

I was also jealous of Derek because of the attention he got from girls. Although he wasn’t very athletic, he was tall, fit and good-looking. And his gullible nature, I think, made a lot of them think he was cute. You know, like a lost puppy you just want to take care of. Unfortunately for them, Derek was too absorbed in his own world of Marvel comic books, Stephen King, Family Guy, and Doctor Who to ever take a hint.

This got really interesting in grade ten when Christie Blackwell, a preppy girl from the states, came to our town. Her family was from North Dakota and her father had come here for some administrative job at the local mining company. We didn’t know it at the time, but his position and his family’s move were only temporary.

Now, we had likely nothing in common with this girl, but both Derek and I were absolutely smitten. When you’re in a small town all the kids date each other’s sisters and exes, so I guess everyone was pretty intrigued by this new, pretty face from somewhere exotic – like North Dakota.

For a few weeks, she was all Derek and I could talk about. Some of our other friends thought she was cute too, but Derek and I were head-over-heels. I, however, never got up the courage to speak with her. I might have been top of my class and on the lacrosse team but, I knew what I was in the eyes of girls – a short, fat, sarcastic little boy with a sour disposition. Derek, however, he didn’t have the same cowardice I had. He actually went up to her during lunch break and talked with her!

I watched him approach, grinning from ear to ear, waiting for the humiliation and the peal of shrieking laughter from the other girls. But – she actually talked with him. She was positively radiant when he introduced himself and – I thought I was going to have a heart-attack when – she invited him to sit down at her table.

I admit, I was enraged. It wasn’t fair. It just. Wasn’t. Fair. For some idiot like Derek, with no prospects for the future, to have that girl. And what would that mean for me? Why would he want to hang around some loser when he had that girl on his arm?

Luckily, Derek – as I’ve said – didn’t take hints easily, so it wasn’t until a rumor had started about her liking him that he finally was ready to ask her out.

Of course, he told me first.

“Jimmy!” he shouted over the phone one night. I remember I actually winced from the receiver. “Guess what?” his voice blared at arm’s length. After placing the phone back to my ear, I asked him, and he told me that he had heard it from one of the girls that Christie liked him.

I felt a stone form in the pit of my stomach. Don’t get me wrong, I knew that I wouldn’t have gotten Christie. I just thought neither of us would. So, the fact that he got her, and I hadn’t, really burned my ass.

But then, I got an idea. An idea that would haunt me for the rest of my life.

“Derek,” I said into the phone. “She doesn’t actually like you. I overheard her and Jennifer (the girl who told him). They’re just playing a trick on you.”

There was silence on the other end.

Derek mumbled out a pitiful “But…” and I knew I had to pounce.

“Listen,” I implored, “if you ask Christie out on a date, everyone will just laugh at you. They’re just doing this to make a fool out of you in front of everyone.”

Again, silence fell on the other end. I could then visualize Derek with his head hanging down, all mopey like he sometimes got.

Then, I took it a bit further. Over the line.

“I mean, c’mon, think about it. You and her? She’s only been in our school three weeks and she’s already top of the class. Everyone turns their head to see her. How are you going to be good enough for *that*?”

I felt that stone in the pit of my stomach again, but this time for a different reason, after hearing Derek sadly mumble, “You’re right…”

Shamelessly, I changed the subject, asking him if we were going to still hang out this weekend to play X-box at his house but, his voice never came back to normal.

That night, I barely slept. I really felt like shit.

This was the first trick I pulled on Derek that made me feel that way. But it wouldn’t be the last.

It was grade eleven, when Lloyd (our other friend) and I took the pranks too far.

Lloyd and I had just gotten back our exam results for grade 11 Physics and, while we didn’t fail, these marks weren’t going to look good on a university application either. Plus, it was December, so there wasn’t much time left in the semester to make up for it. Of course, ole Derek wasn’t in Physics. Or Chemistry. Or Biology. He found some loophole in a technicality to take something called “Earth and Space Science” in grade 12 for his science/technology credit (don’t ask me how the Ontario education system works).

Also, around this time, Derek was getting super-obsessed with comic books and writing his own (report cards and postsecondary prospects be damned). At the time we thought it was really funny. He didn’t just draw the six boxes with stick-figures in ‘em and the poorly graphed word bubbles like most kids; he actually found out the proper format to write a comic book *script*. He kept trying to make us read them but – I mean – we didn’t know how. Plus, we were busy. You know, with school?

Anyway, Derek had this long bastard of a comic book script freshly printed from the school library – an adaptation of some classic horror story by Poe or Lovecraft, I think – and he ran up to Lloyd and me in the cafeteria all smiling, waving it at us, begging us to read it. And, remember, this was the same day we got our abysmal test scores back.

Now, despite our understandably pissy mood, both Lloyd and I resisted the urge to tear Derek’s head off. Lloyd said feebly, “Sure, Derek. Give it here. I’ll read it tonight.”

Derek almost leapt off the table bench, he was so excited. He thanked us and then was off to God knows where.

I turned my head and glowered at Lloyd.

“Are you serious?” I asked him. “You realize we have presentation for Chemistry to finish tonight, right?”

Lloyd blew out the side of his mouth.

“I’m not gonna read it, dude,” he said, his eyes cast woefully down on the crumb and grease laden tabletop. “I’m just pranking him,” he concluded, quarter-heartedly.

I sat there and stared at it for a few seconds. Then, another mendacious scheme started spinning in my head.

I knew that my Uncle Eric was coming over for supper that weekend. I told Lloyd that we would both tell Derek that my uncle worked for Marvel Comics and that he had read his script and loved it. And that he was interested in adapting it and giving Derek a job writing for Stan Lee. I’d invite Derek over to speak with him to discuss this “job prospect” at greater length. The funny thing was, my Uncle Eric was a belligerent drunk who’d mostly been unemployed between his time as a trucker and his time as a garbageman. But never – it probably doesn’t need to be said – did he ever work for Marvel Comics.

Lloyd and I both grinned and giggled like evil children. It was perfect. This way, we wouldn’t have to be drilled by Derek’s questions about what our favourite part was; he would be too preoccupied by the idea of having his work actually published. Working for Marvel Comics for Christ’s sake! An early Christmas present for our naïve young friend.

…I guess you can probably figure out what happened next. I’ll try to spare you the cringe-worthy details.

The next morning, Lloyd and I told Derek about my uncle and fed him our line. Derek beamed like I’d never seen before and bought it hook-line-and-sinker. Of course. That Sunday, he came over for dinner, all excited. Of course. My Uncle Eric was two-sheets to the wind, six gin-and-tonics deep and on his seventh that night. Of course. And when Derek approached him, asking about his script and what it’s like to work for Marvel, my Uncle Eric harshly barked what in the hell he was blathering about. Of course.

I promised Lloyd I would give him all the details on Monday. But seeing Derek, hunched over and defeated, like some withered daffodil – I just, had to look away. I didn’t laugh. Didn’t chuckle. Didn’t even smirk. All I could do was look away, that pit in my stomach turning to stone.

On Monday, in front of the school entrance, about thirty minutes before first bell and thirty degrees below zero, Derek stormed right up to me. Indifferent, seeing this coming and finding no despair, surprise or pleasure in it, I stood where I was, ready for him to hammer me.

Instead, there were no threats, no curses, no accusations. Just one question: did I lie about Christie Blackwell too?

Despite being exhausted from the endless stream of assignments and last night’s interminable guilt, I somehow managed the strength to slowly shake my head and mutter no. One last prank on Derek.

With that, Derek said nothing. And simply walked away.

At that moment, standing there alone with sticky icicles running down my upper lip from my nose to my scarf, I thought I was going to throw up.

The next day, I advised Lloyd we give Derek some distance at lunch hour. I suspected we were personae non grata.

But, to my surprise, Derek came over to our table. Stone-faced, without a word he sat down and ate. Lloyd and I glanced over at him then at each other. The three of us just sat and chewed in silence.

Then, after finishing his serving of oily cafeteria French fries, he told us one of his typically great, terrifying stories. His last.

“You guys ever hear about Melvin Sinclair?” he began, cryptically.

Fake-sounding name. Still, a pretty good start.

Lloyd and I both shook our heads, wordlessly.

“He was a student at our school. Way back, when it was run by the nuns.”

I later found out this part of his story was true. Our high school – Pendleton College – was once run by the local nunnery – but this was when it was still a residential school, with only abused, shipped-in Native kids as its student body.

“He’s actually the person I am [REDACTED_NAME] to write my next comic script on. I know you two won’t read it, but I think you should hear about him anyway.

“Sinclair was a funny kid. A bit stupid, you know? Believed anything his pals told him.”

This, of course, immediately rang a bell for both of us. Lloyd and I looked at each other knowingly. Still, we were hooked. At least, I was.

“He was also very poor with a sick father at home who couldn’t work. So, a lot of his friends could make him do things with the promise of money.

“So, one night, around this time of year – just before Christmas, all those years ago, Sinclair and his buddies went out onto Saul Laskin Lake. It was frozen solid then, just like it is right now. Sinclair got dared by his buddies to walk out onto the lake – see if he could make it to the other side.

“Now, Sinclair was afraid. Terrified, you know? Saul Laskin is two football fields long and three fields wide. Sure, he knew it had been frozen solid for three months straight and a jackhammer couldn’t make a dent an inch deep in it. But still, he was unsure. He never walked across ice in the middle of winter before. Never even put on a pair of skates.

“To his buddies, he shook his head, no. He didn’t care if it made him a chicken. He wasn’t going out there, risking falling through.

“So, his friends decided to sweeten the deal. They told him that if he made it to the other side, they’d meet him there, after walking along the shoreline, and pay him three-hundred dollars.

“Now, his buddies didn’t have three-hundred dollars, but they did have a thick wad of ten two-dollar bills. So, they slipped one into Sinclair ’s hand, as proof there was more where that’d come from. They both figured it would be worth it to see Sinclair fall through the ice or wet himself from fear.

“Again, Sinclair wasn’t too bright. He was also very poor, and his family was way behind on the electric bill, which was bad since this was one of the worst winters in Canadian history. Not to mention, Christmas was right around the corner. So, he took the two dollars as proof they had two-hundred-and-ninety-eight more and made his way across the ice.

“The two of his friends giggled behind their frozen-snot-covered mittens, egging him on, telling him he was doing great. Sinclair didn’t clue in though. He just kept going, waddling and swaying from side to side like a tight rope walker, terrified the rhino-hide-thick ice would give.

“Now, his two buddies didn’t want Sinclair to get hurt. Not seriously anyway. At worst, they were waiting for him to slip and fall on his ass, so they could laugh at him until their bellies were sore.

“So, Sinclair got sixty feet across the ice when his buddies at the shore heard a sudden crunch. A sharp, unmistakable sound. The ice had cracked. Saul Laskin was giving under Sinclair ’s weight. Apparently, the lake wasn’t so titanium at the middle.

“Feeling a sudden rush of panic and just a bit of guilt, both of them started hollering at the top of their lungs for Sinclair to get off the ice. To turn back. Sinclair didn’t turn around though. He didn’t even stop walking. He was determined to make it to the other side. To make that three-hundred dollars. Cracks in the ice be damned, his house needed heat!

“His pals on the shore watched in horror when Sinclair took four more steps before plummeting through the ice on the fifth. Unable to think, being dumb kids, they freaked and ran away. It took them ten minutes before they realized they needed to go get help.

“A couple of the teachers and one of the farmers from town came out onto the ice. When they got to the break where Sinclair had fallen in, they made a horrific discovery. On the other side of the hole, was a set of freshly frozen footprints. Like prints in the snow but upside down and inside out. They were glistening and raised, like a trail of swollen scar-tissue. And they headed to the other side – to the end of Saul Laskin Lake.

“On the shoreline, the five of them ran to the other side of the pond, coming to the very end, to find that the steps ended at a second gaping hole in the ice.

“Sinclair ’s body was never found. But the doctors were certain it should have been impossible for him to have walked that length of the ice without succumbing to hypothermia.

“Ever since that night, on the anniversary of Melvin Sinclair ’s arctic plunge, they say he comes back, still drenched and half-frozen stiff, looking for the three-hundred dollars promised him. And taking any unfortunate soul who dares wander across the ice, mistaking them for his two pals who had played that cruel joke on him, so very long ago.”

Lloyd and I stared back at Derek speechless, our mouths agape.

The silence was interrupted when two loud, chortling sophomores bumped into Derek from behind, making their way past him.

“This has got to be bull,” Lloyd insisted, rearing back from the table.

“Where’d you get this?” I asked, my eyes having never left Derek’s face.

“I told you,” he said. “It’s the basis of my next comic script, which you won’t read. There are some things out there that can’t be understood. But you can find them out if you just suspend your disbelief.”

I looked hard at him. He smirked.

“I heard it from one of the teachers and from one of the upper-class men last year,” he confessed. “Both of them told the story exactly as I just did.”

I was then fairly certain what Derek was going to say next. And I was right.

“The anniversary of Melvin Sinclair ’s disappearance is tonight,” he whispered, as though we were sharing state-level secrets. “I say we go to Saul Laskin after dark and check it out.”

Lloyd blew out his mouth, his lips making that *pffft* sound.

“Yeah, all right,” I said hastily. Almost automatically.

“What?” Lloyd blurted.

“I’ll go,” I continued. “Hell, let’s all go.”

“Great!” said Derek, over Lloyd’s grumbled protest. “Meet you both at the shoreline near Tenth and Mockingbird. Be there at ten, sharp.”

With that, Derek stood from his seat, carrying his meal tray to the metal rack and exiting the caf.

“Dude,” Lloyd spun on me. “What gives?”

“Look, man,” I offered Lloyd, weakly. “We did a really lousy thing to Derek. I think the least we can do is spend one late night with him on this little whim.”

“That’s crap!” snapped Lloyd. “This is your way of playing another prank on him.”

I shook my head vigorously, vexed by his charge. “No way!”

“Yeah? Well maybe this is Derek’s way of getting us back. Playing a prank on us. You ever think of that?”

“I doubt it. Derek’s not like that.”

Lloyd just shook his head, obviously miffed.

We didn’t say anything after that. But we both knew we were going to Saul Laskin Lake that evening to meet Derek.

I remember it was ten below zero. Felt like minus twenty with the wind-chill and even worse that close to the ice. The stars were probably out, and fully visible, but I don’t remember seeing them. I could barely see what was in front of me from my face being two-thirds buried behind my scarph and tuque.

I met Lloyd on the way there, about ten yards from the shoreline on Mockingbird, and he was likewise dressed as a winter mummy. As we got closer, we saw a figure standing upright, unfazed by the cutting gale. It was Derek. He was in his snow-pants and a parka but wasn’t wearing anything to cover his head. Just a pair of earmuffs. Bizarrely, he seemed completely comfortable out there, his flushed red cheeks the only thing betraying how cold he was.

“Well, here we are,” he greeted us, cryptically. A just as cryptic smile on his chapped, purple lips.

“What are we doing out here?” Lloyd growled, rubbing his thickly gloved hands together and bouncing from one foot to the other. “It’s freezing!”

“We’re here to see if Melvin Sinclair ’s ghost shows up,” I told him.

The look he gave me could have thawed Saul Laskin Lake.

“I never said it was a ghost,” said Derek, just over the wind.

The two of us stared at our guide into the other world.

“Then what is it?” I asked.

“A *zombie*?” Lloyd mocked.

Feigning ignorance, Derek just shrugged.

The three of us stood there, in the middle of December in Canada, staring at the frozen lake like three wallflowers around a dancefloor (an analogy that’s not much of a stretch for us).

Predictably, Derek broke the silence.

“How about we play some Truth or Dare?” he asked. I looked over and saw that cryptic smile on his now bluish lips.

“How about we play some Go-Home-And-Sleep-In-A-House-With-Central-Heating?” Lloyd barked.

Me, I couldn’t help myself.

“Sure,” I said. “Let’s play some Truth or Dare.”

“You first,” Derek pounced.

Ordinarily, I would have bickered back and forth with Derek to try to get him to go first, but my recently grown conscience forced me to accept this condition.

“Okay,” I said. I then looked out onto the ice, anticipating what the dare might be and not having any of it. “Truth.”

For the first time that night, Derek’s strange smirk disappeared.

“All right,” he said, his face and voice now very serious. “Yesterday morning,” my mind then immediately raced to that moment, regretting my choice for Truth, “when I asked you about Christie Blackwell,”

“Okay, okay, never mind!” I shouted over him, before he could even get the question out. “I changed my mind. Dare. Give me a dare. What? You want me to walk across the lake? Is that it?”

Without speaking, Derek nodded his head, that cryptic little grin reappearing.

I then looked back at the frozen lake. Derek hadn’t lied when he said that it was two football fields long. In fact, it was longer. 273.5 yards to be exact. From where we were standing, I could see only half of the ice, the other side swallowed up by night and fog.

“Okay, here’s a deal,” I said, trying to negotiate my way out of it. “I’ll go as far as where that fog starts. That’s just before you two won’t be able to see me.”

“No deal,” said Derek, his eyes colder than Saul Laskin. “You go all the way across, or until you see Melvin Sinclair, or you admit you believed my story enough that you’re scared to go out there.”

“What?”

“Or choose Truth.”

“I’m not scared of that boogeyman crap!” I exclaimed.

“Then why not go all the way?” said Derek. “You know that lake is perfectly safe for skating. It’s been frozen solid since October.”

“Because it’s stupid, that’s why.”

“Or because you’re afraid Melvin Sinclair will get you.”

“No, I’m not.”

“Fine. Then choose Truth. Answer my question.”

Astonished, I shot him an incredulous look.

“Man, screw you!” I cried. “You’re the one who’s so stupid that you believe that dumb story. You probably did hear it from an upper-class man last year. They knew you’d be gullible enough to buy it.”

I turned to the frozen pond, my eyes melting the ice.

“I’m going to go as far as that fog starts. From there, I’ll be able to see over to the other side. I’ll also be right in the middle so it will prove two things: One, that no one could fall through the ice when it’s this cold out, and two, that there isn’t some supernatural creature roaming around at night. I’ll prove to you there’s no such thing.”

Derek looked back at me. That strange smile disappeared again from his lips and never came back.

“I’m not gullible,” he insisted in a low voice. “The story is true.”

“Ah, up yours,” I said, walking to the edge of the shoreline and shuffling gingerly onto the ice. “Come on, Lloyd. Let’s go.”

“Me?” I heard from behind.

“Come on, you wimp. Let’s show this moron how stupid and full of it he is.”

The two of us waddled onto Saul Laskin. We inched our way closer and closer to the foggy middle, the thick air never seeming to thin out and recede like it normally would. Truthfully, I could barely see an inch in front of me; the whipping, cold air caused me to tear up and turned my tears to icicles on my lashes. But I was too angry to care. In my mind, I told myself I was going to prove to Derek what an idiot he was. In truth, I just wanted anyway to avoid telling him the truth about Christie Blackwell.

We were well past the center-point when I finally decided to stop. Lloyd was a bit ahead of me. I looked around. The fog was so dense. Even worse, I had to blink my eyes rapidly to break up the frozen moisture that accumulated on my lashes.

I roughly cleared my vision with my gloved thumb. And then I saw it. A hunched figure, just obscured by the fog, hobbling slowly toward Lloyd. Lloyd must have been having the same trouble I was, because he made no effort to run or communicate with the figure, even though it was practically right in his line of sight.

At first, I thought it was Derek. Thought he had somehow caught up and was trying to scare us. But I was wrong. I was very, very wrong.

I tried to warn Lloyd. To shout out. To ask who was there. But I couldn’t. The words were trapped in my throat. I was as petrified as the ice I stood upon. I stared, seeing the nearly naked figure come into focus. It was a man – or…what was once a man. The skin was pale, translucent, all the blue and purple veins visible. The hair was blonde – silver and slicked back, like the head had just been submerged in water. It looked like a cadaver that had escaped from the city morgue. Its bright coloured eyes resembled a pair of round, broken mirrors, and never once did I see them close. Not even blink.

Then, I…I heard it speak!

“*I did it…*” it muttered, hoarsely, the sound like the ruffling of crumpled paper. “*I did it…where is she*?”

The creature was mere feet from Lloyd, but he’d turned his back to it like it wasn’t there. He then lifted his head, one red eye open, and asked, “Jimmy? Did you say –”

Before he could finish, the walking cadaver shot a long, bony arm, grasping his shoulder with its claw-like fingers.

Lloyd looked around and shrieked.

“*Where is she*?” the thing muttered huskily. “*Where’s my baby*?”

Undoubtedly terrified, Lloyd tried to sprint away, only to slip and fall on the ice. The walking cadaver’s grip remained unbroken, causing Lloyd’s winter coat to rip. The thing pinned him, its grasping claws shaking Lloyd by the lapels.

“*You said if I did it, you’d tell me where she was*!” it hissed into Lloyd’s face. I watched, still petrified, only able to imagine the look of confusion and terror on Lloyd’s bundled-up face.

“*Where is she*!” the creature screamed. “*Where is she? You promised. You promised\**!” \* Its voice cracked on the last syllable.

It then started throwing Lloyd’s torso up and down, until the back of his head hit the ice with a shuddering thud. I cringed. It was like the sound of a bowling ball being dropped straight to the tiled, wooden floor. The thing then mounted him, clawing and punching at his lifeless form in a hungry frenzy. With its cracked, blackened teeth bared, the canines resembled a set of fangs.

I wanted to run. I wanted to help – to fight that thing off of my friend. But I swear, I – I couldn’t.

By the time that thing had stopped, I could see freshly fallen red droplets, steaming on the ice around Lloyd’s head. I knew then that he was gone.

What happened next, I can’t explain. The creature laid down on Lloyd’s supine body, putting its pale, grotesquely scabbed head on his chest, as though listening for a heartbeat. I then realized that the fog was thickening. There were whole plumes of smoke wafting up from the ice beneath their bodies. I realized when they began to sink, that the ice was melting.

The creature sunk down beneath the ice, pulling my friend’s carcass along with it. Once they had slipped out of sight, I heard the worst sound you could possibly imagine. The sound of the ice cracking. I looked at my feet and saw a deep gash, shaped like a lightning bolt, tearing a path through the ice beneath my feet and between my legs. Several mini fractures splintered off, creating a spider-web of icy shards.

My senses returning to me, I ran, falling and stumbling, back to the shoreline. I don’t know how many steps I made before I slid and fell through – and was completely submerged in Saul Laskin.

I don’t remember how cold it was – though it was freezing beyond imagination. I just remember the disgusting feeling of my clothes soaking in the water beside my skin– and the sheer panic blaring inside my skull.

Remember how I was short and fat? Well, I also didn’t have a clue how to swim. I just floated there, under the water, not seeing a damned thing, my mind a riot of horrible scenarios and images.

As you would expect, I flailed in desperate mortal fear when I felt a hand grab at me and pull. Thankfully, the hand was pulling me upward, to safety. And it belonged to Derek.

“Jimmy,” Derek panted, after he’d dragged me up onto the surface. “It’s – it’s okay,” he struggled to say, as he too was drenched from head to toe. “Here’s my – my coat...p-put it on.”

He then laid his open parka over my body. Luckily, he had taken it off before diving in to save me. I’m sure now if it wasn’t for his quick thinking, I’d have died that night.

“L-listen – listen to me,” he stammered on. His lips were turning a deep blue, as was his face. “My phone is in one of the coat pockets, call 9-1-1.”

“W-what?” I said, not understanding why he didn’t do it himself.

“Just do it,” he said, then turned and began walking in the direction of that creature.

“Wait!”

“I’m – I’m going to g-g-go get L-l-l-loyd!” he blurted out. Now, this is where I’d like to tell you that I forced Derek to stay with me. That I told him the truth about Christie Blackwell. That I apologized for the cruel joke I had played on him with Lloyd and my Uncle Eric. And for always taking him and his friendship for granted. But that didn’t happen. Shivering from the cold and my own fear, I just watched as he marched away, disappearing into the fog.

I took out his phone from the right pocket and dialed 9-1-1. I remember hearing the phone ring, the monotonous sound reverberating in my skull. I don’t remember anyone answering.

The last thing I remember is the feeling of my body growing warm. All the pain and fear evaporating with the fog. And then, there was blackness. Blackness save for a kaleidoscope of horrible images playing on loop in my mind.

I woke up in the emergency room.

I was told that the paramedics and fire department were called out. That they’d scanned the ice but never found Derek or Lloyd. I was told that I was lucky to be alive. Even luckier that I didn’t have frostbite and would therefore not have to lose any appendages.

Eventually, they got around to asking me why we were out there and what happened. I told them everything. Every last detail. Of course, they all looked at me like I was crazy. Some of them even thought that I might have gone into shock and asked my parents to have me undergo a CAT scan. I never did though.

During my time in the hospital, three thoughts kept spinning around my brain. One, how grateful I was to Derek Zimmer for saving my life. Two, how amazed I was that his story was actually true. And three, why that creature kept asking for its baby, instead of for money, like in Derek’s story. I found out later that the story Derek had told us that afternoon was one of many legends concerning Saul Laskin Lake and that night. Some were about a man whose daughter had been kidnapped by a gang of thieves; that the man was thrown into the lake, his feet encased in concrete, after he’d paid their ransom. Some were of a mentally disturbed woman who had drowned her baby, thinking it was possessed by the devil. And at least half a dozen more I can’t stomach reciting here.

Perhaps the worst moment after that night was when I got a visit from Missus Calhoun, the principal at Pendleton College. She was in her early seventies, stout, with a tight, silver bob cut and a pair of owlish spectacles on her round, little nose. She sat down at my bedside, wearing her shapeless, riotously patterned muumuu, and asked me what had happened at Saul Laskin. I told her. The same story I had told everyone since waking up in the emergency room. When I was done, she just stared at me, expressionless, before giving out a sharp sigh through her tiny nostrils.

“This is what I think happened, James,” she began, a subtle disdain in her voice. “I think you dared Lloyd Apanowicz and Derek to walk out there on the ice. We all know how you tricked and tortured that poor boy since primary school.

“I think when the ice cracked, and your friends fell in, you panicked and came up with this ludicrous lie to cover your tracks, because you think we’re all as gullible as poor Derek Zimmer. Because you think you’re that smart and the rest of us are that dumb. I think you’re a cruel, immature, sociopathic little boy who’ll end up becoming a cheat and a fraud and spend his adult life in and out of prison.”

From my bed, I stared back at her wide-eyed. It was so surreal. An adult – a *teacher* – speaking to me in such a way.

“And I don’t care who you tell this to,” she hissed. “Because I’m retiring at the end of this school year. And if I never see another sadistic child like you again, it’ll be too soon.”

When I brought up how I had been rescued, had almost succumb to hypothermia myself, she grunted and said, “I don’t know. You seem all right to me. After all, you didn’t even get frostbite out there, did you? And you’re the only one of those boys who survived.”

She then shook her grey head at me, making a *tsk-tsk-tsk* noise with her tongue.

“In and out of prison,” she repeated to herself, before rising from her chair and leaving me on my own.

Today, I’m happy to tell you her prognosis was false. I haven’t been in jail at any time in my life and the worst I’ve ever gotten is a speeding ticket. That being said, guilt has followed me around ever since that night.

I never told Derek that I had lied about Christie Blackwell, and for that I am [REDACTED_NAME] sorry. As I am [REDACTED_NAME] making Lloyd come with me across the frozen lake. I had also doubted Derek about his story of the spirit that haunts Saul Laskin once a year on a December night. For that too, I am [REDACTED_NAME].

I don’t know what compelled me to play so many tricks on him, besides my overly logical, and cynical nature. But ever since that night, I’m not so quick to dismiss something – even if it does seem fantastic. Or even [impossible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/malcolmmacdonaldfic/)",3
mawe9m,1616442906.0,2021-03-22 19:55:06,stories,Here is a story.," 

I'm a Mexican-American step-son to a heroin addict / turned southern Baptist pastor in early southern California in the 80's. You know that kid tugging on their papa's pant leg in tears wondering why people don't want to go to heaven. It is not till later you realize that people are not looking for Jesus in downtown San Diego on a Friday night.

You get moved from San Diego and your friends at 4 turning 5. You feel you just learned the English language because well. You can speak quite well for someone who is 4 right? Find yourself and your little brother in a village made of dirt roads. A place where some people have never seen someone speak English fluently. Much less a 5 year old, that is another story.

Honestly, though I was fine - I was promised my first pet when we got there. Sombra, and Pig - actually well when you move to ranch/mission wherever this white church sent us. Every new animal is a pet. Anyways Pig became papa Pig - and probably close to 700lb's.

You see I had been guarding his cage. My father had promised the villagers a big barbacoa feast once we killed the pig and well. I was not having it. That being said I had also recently set my eyes on a machete. Because well that is another story right. Time went on and the inevitable day came. My mother took me aside and explained to me ( we both knew what it meant to be hungry by then ), I was standing in the way of the Barbacoa and you know, I do like bacon.

Anyways the villagers knew I wanted the machete because they are the ones that informed me that only men carry machetes. When I was 5 there was nothing I wanted more than to people to answer my questions and well treat me like a man. Pretty sure I was getting on their nerves, because they kept shooing me away as I tried to help them with our mission construction project.

The morning came. I do not know why but I needed to be there. Drug my little brother with me because we did everything together! I remember crying uncontrollably - it is just one of those things. The construction workers from the village saw me and they started speaking to my father - I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my, I know my father did not translate everything they said. I'll leave it at that for now.

The Deal. They knew I wanted respect - they knew I wanted them to treat me like a man - and speak to me like their equal or just - that is what I wanted when I was 5. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you see where this is going - I had to kill Pig. And in return I would have their respect and they would treat me like a man - I was suddenly straddled with this choice. I grabbed Franky and we went into a huddle where the others couldn't hear us.

I explained to him that I needed to kill Pig, because he was going to die anyways, and if I do that I can get the machete and I could use it to protect us from Dad. I apologized to Pig, as he sat there mushed up with poles and whatever in the pen to hold him still for me - they handed me a pocket knife. All these men looked at me crying holding this knife with the cold stone faces. Actually, some of them were laughing - until they actually saw me release a WARCRY as I ran at Pig with the knife pointed right at that spot a little behind the jawline and straight to heart. And I plunged that knife straight into him - right up to the hilt, right.

I have been studying the effects of a blade at that time - and on T.V. you stick a blade into someone and they die, right? Nah, Pig started well thrashing and everyone started yelling at me because I needed to get that blade to the heart. There is a thing when you thought you gave it all you had - and you knew some of that you would never get back.

I needed to finish the job. You see Pig in pain and you know what you have to do - and you just shove that damn arm in there all the way to the shoulder and you just start stabbing at anything in there. I have always had a strong gag reflex - so there is that as well - you just keep yelling and stabbing. Finally Pig, slowly begins to... subside. You kind of fall into this pile with him on the floor in the bloody mud - it was a very brisk morning and the sun was not quite over the mountains far away. They allowed me to lay there crying for a few minutes and before they knew it, someone was telling me I needed to take my arm out of Pig.

The part my father did not translate for me had to do something with Corazon, right I needed to take a bite out of it. This was almost unacceptable for me because the DEAL was - and yet here we were. Realizing he left that part out - from the expression on their faces - because they were stone cold serious. I knew this - by this time I knew when someone was serious. I have come so far - I was so mad they made me do this part because I felt like - I had already earned what I had set out to achieve.

I can remember gagging on this chunk of flesh. I tried several times to stick it in my mouth and well - after trying to chew it - I realized I just needed to go for the hard swallow. I started choking on it - I remember - I was stuck in my throat. As I stood there trying to pretend I wasn't choking. My arms started motioning for them to bring me the machete. I held that blade in my hand and swallowed that thing with ease.

People may look at a story like this in disgust. This experience is something I always thought of as 'one' of those moments you relish. See, people. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Aztec warrior, I know, I feel I know what it takes to protect the people you love and your right to be heard in this world. I knew right there and then I was a man. This is one of those stories I know people like to write off as a tragic event. Which I guess it could have been - whenever I have tried to tell this story people. I usually get stopped here.

They never take the time to read the last paragraph. You see - after that - every single man in that village treated me like a man. People around say, oh that's cute! Nope, actually after that they stopped shooing me away and began to teach me. Their ways, I think it's funny because - in a way I knew some of those men had more respect for me than my father. It was not this superficial pinning a sheriffs badge on a donkey thing. Then you move back to San Diego to attend some posh little 'christian academy' where children treat you like a Mexican-Aborigine - than you know a Mexican-American - because I forgot how to speak English - and you want to tell them this but you are trying to remember how the words go.

They gave me a machete - and I kept that thing razor sharp. I used to sleep with it till my Dad realized that well - I intended to use it on him if he came at me and my brother again. I have a bunch of stories. I have stories, maybe not as graphic as this one but it doesn't really matter because they are my stories and Aztec warriors are usually not concerned about much else than the things they believe in.

Since then I have done, well a lot. I have seen the world and the people in it. You join the Army to do that. It's pretty cheap you should try it! You spend years being the best soldier you can possibly be. You get back from spending over a year in Kuwait - and you are getting ready to ship off to somewhere else. So you find some strippers and well - let us just say they make an example of you and the other Mexican they found smoking crack in the barracks.

You are so used to be told what to do - you seem kind of fine with it. One strike and your out - with you 'general under' honorable condition discharge. You charge out and hang out with the SCAD kids right because they love art - I love art. Then it slowly becomes apparent you do not have anything to offer them - so you slowly just pine away at some crappy job. Where you are the 'technician coordinator' - because you show up with 7 years of experience and they place this 25 year old princess living with her parents as your 'boss'. That is fine right - because you are leading by example.

So you lead by example for 7 years.. and you work through this damn pandemic. Listening to the people you work with complain about this work they must do. Yet you have been working this hard if not actually much harder for the past 7 years. They promote you, ask you to train these children yet - they make it very clear to everyone - that I have absolutely no authority to ask any of our junior pharmacy technicians to do anything. Sometimes they forget you're there and you hear yourself being called things you never thought of yourself as, and training our ‘new’ trainees - well to not listen to a word you say.

You tell this to your boss and he tells you - ' well that is being a leader.'

Thankfully, I decided to get a bachelor of computer science, these past 4 years so - full-time and you know. I have been busy. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] vacation right now - I should be looking for an entry-level computer whatever (opening an art studio). I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I'll find something somewhere, hopefully. 

Just wish I could write 'AZTEC WARRIOR' in skills and qualifications. Because this is just stupid.",3

He had a PhD in physics and spent most of his career working for NASA in the 70s and 80s. He wasn’t an astronaut, but he was heavily involved in research and development for space missions.

When I was a teenager, I asked him the big question: “Did we really land on the moon?”

He didn’t laugh, didn’t roll his eyes—just gave me this tired smile and said, “Kid, if you knew how many people it takes to fake something like that, you’d realize it’s easier to just go to the damn moon.”

That answer has stuck with me ever since.

I want to say that right away, because a lot of people will know that name and I want to begin by being totally honest. Most of you know what I have done, or at least you know what has been claimed.  But I have not done what they claim.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] the monster that you believe me to be. I know that I sound like everyone else sitting in prison, spouting off claims of innocence, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] you the truth. I am [REDACTED_NAME] a liar. I have never lied about that night. And I won’t start now. None of what I am [REDACTED_NAME] to tell you will be lies. You need to understand that.  You think that you know me, but you don’t.


I have tried to tell my story a million times but no one wants to listen. The media doesn’t want to report it. The police don’t want to hear it.  They want to cage the monster and throw away the key. 


When no one was looking, I found a way to get my story onto the internet.  I have found a way to speak directly to the people, uncut and unedited. 


Maybe I am [REDACTED_NAME] into the wind.  Maybe.  But I am [REDACTED_NAME] to be free of that night. All I need is for someone out there somewhere to read this and believe me. My only hope in writing this is that someone will hear my side of the story and it will ring a bell or hit a nerve, because they have experienced something similar.


I can’t be the only one.


I just can’t be.


It happened a little over two years ago.


I remember that night as being normal. Boring. I am [REDACTED_NAME] going to paint you a detailed picture of the weather or how the moonlight caused the icicles to twinkle, because I don’t remember what the weather was like that night.  It wasn’t a detail that stuck in my brain. It was winter in Ohio, which means that it was probably cold and there might have been some snow on the ground. Beyond that...I don’t know.


It was a Wednesday.


Like I said.  Normal and boring.


I was nineteen at the time and living in my parent’s basement, which had been turned into a little make-shift apartment. I had my own toilet, stove, and minifridge. A short black futon. And a basic Tv, too.  Not even a flat-screen.  One of those ancient, heavy ass antiques that didn’t even connect to WiFi.  It was okay, though.  I was able to play my Xbox on it. I didn’t need anything else, at the time. Like that singing bear from that kid’s movie, I had the bare necessities of life. 


I know that it is a little cliche.  A grown man living in his parent’s basement.  But I was going to college at Kent State and my folks were trying to help me out by giving me a roof and a bed.  They didn’t want me to have to worry about anything but my school work, so I didn’t have to have a job either.


Doing well in school was the most important thing, they always told me.


They were great parents. The best. None of what happened was their fault. They didn’t do anything wrong. And they don’t deserve what the people in the news have been saying about them.


My dad had a stroke about a year ago. The stress of everything was just too much on him.  He lived, thank god. And my mom says that he is doing better every day.  He gets around just fine now, I guess, and his speech is starting to get back to normal.


Part of me wishes that he would start visiting me again. Seeing his face would be amazing. But I get it. Another stroke might kill him.  If I had to choose, I’d rather have him alive and in the world, than dead and in the ground. I need to know that he is out there somewhere, even if I don’t get to see him.


I just hope that he hasn’t lost his faith in me.  But maybe he has.  At this point, I couldn’t really blame him.


I just want him to know that I love him and am sorry...for everything.


My life wasn’t the only one destroyed.


I will never forget the date when everything I loved died.


January 12th.


And I was in between semesters, which was a much deserved period of downtime for me.  Finals had been more of a nightmare than usual and I was wiped out.  All I wanted to do was hang out at home and relax. I didn’t want to look at another textbook or see another classroom until I had no other choice. I needed to unwind and rest up before the next semester started in a couple of weeks. 


I called up my friend Micah. 


Micah had been my best friend for most of my life.  I vaguely remember the first time I met Micah, but my mom liked to tell the story.  I have heard it so many times that I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure if I actually remember it or not.  It had been the first day of second grade, I guess.  The kids were allowed to bring a single toy to school each day and play with it during recess. My mom had bought me a brand new, little fire truck specifically for that first day.  But Micah’s mom must have forgotten to put something in his book bag and he wanted to play with mine.  It was my toy, though, and I wasn’t going to share. We got into a fight underneath the monkey bars and the recess teacher had to break us up. Both our mothers had to come and pick us up early from school.  There weren’t any black eyes or bloody noses. We were just two bad little boys rolling around in the dirt. Our moms were so mad that day, but they became friends because of it, too.


Win-win, I guess.


I still smile whenever I think about it.


When I called Micah that night, I told him to bring his ass over and grab a pizza on the way.  I already had Doritos and Funyuns and Mountain Dew. We could get high, eat greasy food, and binge some Impractical Jokers on my Xbox.  


I can still hear him stomping down the basement steps when he finally got there. He always heavily strutted down those stairs, for some reason. I think he did it on purpose, but I never knew for sure why.  He had to make as much noise as possible, had to make sure everyone in the house knew that he was around.  Micah had always been a goofy dude and did weird, random things for no reason.  He must have found it funny to make a lot of racket on my steps. Who knows. As long as he could make himself laugh, nothing else mattered.


I can still picture his face, his wide grin as he presented to me a large pepperoni pizza with extra cheese, as if he had made it himself. His long black hair pulled back in its usual, loose ponytail. The naturally tanned skin of his face seemed flustered, sweaty, as if coming down into my basement had been equivalent to running a marathon. Micah had always been happy, upbeat, no matter the situation, and it is that image of him that I have tried like hell to hold onto. That is how I want to remember my friend. 


Full of life. 


I motioned with my hands for Micah to put the pizza on the stove and have a seat next to me on the futon, which at that moment had been transformed into a couch. On his way over to me, he made a detour to grab a cold can of Mountain Dew from the fridge. He then sat down and cracked open the can. As he was taking a long draw from his drink, I asked, “Are you ready to get high?”


“Always,” he replied after swallowing his pop.  He took another giant gulp, nearly draining it, before placing the can on top of my wooden coffee table.


“I’m ready to relax,” I told him. “I’m ready to get so relaxed that I become a marshmallow and melt right into the fabric of this futon.”


“Well then,” he said. “Break it out and let’s get it going.”


“Me?” I asked him.  “You didn’t bring any?”


“No,” he replied.  “You don’t have any?”


“No.”


“Town’s been dry lately,” Micah mumbled.


We both shook our heads.


It never crossed my mind that Micah would not have anything, he usually had something on him or at least would have grabbed something before heading over to my underground lair. He should have known that the chances that I had any bud were normally slim. My friend was a stoner at heart, but I was never the type of person to get high every day.  I only smoked on rare occasions, like whenever a hard exam or difficult paper was in my rearview and I needed to decompress the frustration.


I remember Micah’s face lighting up.  His back perked up and I knew that my friend had an idea.


“I do have something,” he told me.  When he saw me shaking my head again, he quickly blurted, “Just hear me out. I know that you only smoke bud, my man, but I got something better. Maybe not better...but different.”


I think that I grumbled something like, “What is it?”


“Check it out,” he said as he reached into the front pocket of his sweatpants. It took almost a minute of rummaging in his pocket before he found what he wanted. When he pulled his hand free, it didn’t look like he was holding anything. He then showed me his palm and I saw what at first appeared to be two miniature stamps. “Clowns, man.”


Clowns?  


I didn’t know what he was talking about. I don’t recall picking one from his palm, but I must have, because the next thing that I knew I was holding one of the pieces of paper directly in front of my face. It was so tiny between my fingers.  


As I looked closer, the odd word made more sense. Clowns. Printed across the one side of the paper square was the face of a cartoon clown. And it was a vintage clown, too, like something from the 1950s.  Poofy yellow hair beneath a green top hat. Ovals of white make-up that wrapped around the mouth and both eyes. A wide grin that was both joyous and sad at the same time. And a giant red nose, of course.


“Where the hell did you get this?” I asked him.


“I am [REDACTED_NAME], sir,” Micah replied. “I never divulge my sources to the police.”  He leaned in closer and spoke to my chest, as if I was wearing a listening device.  “I don’t do drugs. Drugs are illegal and they are bad.”


“Whatever,” I said. “Why are you just carrying this around with you?  And since when do you do acid?”


“Since now,” he told me. “My cousin Jayson told me that acid is like a key that opens up the universe. It removes the boundaries between you and God almighty. Everything is revealed. You find the answers to all of the Hows and Whys.”


“Bullshit.”


“And I want to share that key with my best friend,” he told me. “And if we don’t like it, we never do it again.”


“Jayson give you this? That dude is shady and I want nothing to do with it if it comes from him.”


“I got it from somewhere,” he told me.  “Don’t worry.  Just trust me.  Your semester is over.  We ain’t got shit to do.  How about we escape reality for a bit?  Yeah?”


I always had one rule.


I never did anything harder than weed. 


Looking back, I picked the wrong time to break my own rule.


The way that the small square dissolved on my tongue made me question whether it had actually been real paper or something else. In less than three seconds it had entirely disappeared.  I immediately regretted taking it, but it was too late. The train had left the station and the only thing left to do was strap in and put on my helmet. 


I’m not sure how long we sat there and waited. But just when I was getting ready to tell Micah that he must have been ripped off, I felt a tingle rise from the floor of my basement and enter into my feet.  It wasn’t like the pins and needles of a waking limb, but more like an overload of sensation.  As the tingle began to slowly spread upward to the rest of my body, I will have to admit that I kind of liked how it felt. It was like my body was coming alive for the first time ever and I was about to become wide open as the world entered into me. 


I know that doesn’t make sense, but not everything that I am [REDACTED_NAME] to say will.


“Are you feeling that, too?” Micah asked me.  He wasn't looking at me, but staring off toward nothing in particular. 


He couldn’t see me, but I nodded anyway. 


Suddenly, the real world, the one trapped beneath the reality we know, revealed itself to me. Color.  I never knew color until that moment. Not really.  What I had always believed to be color was nothing more than various shades of gray compared to what I started seeing.  Everything around me became vibrant and pulsating, even the dullest parts of my basement became amazing to look at.  Not only were the colors more vivid than anything I had assumed possible, but they also pulsated and moved in waves that rose and fell.  It was kind of like breathing.  Everything around me seemed to be alive, like I had unexpectedly found myself part of a Disney movie, one where even the candlesticks and salt shakers were living things. 


I turned to Micah and I could see layers of color covering his body like a beautiful aura.


That was when I started laughing.  No.  That is not accurate.  I began to chuckle like a mad man and I couldn’t stop for several minutes.  Micah joined my laughing fit by having one of his own. We laughed and laughed and laughed until my throat was dry, my eyes were filled with tears, and my head began to pound.  I honestly think that we both would have laughed ourselves to death if not for the music.  


At first, it was low and seemed to be coming from several points around me. It was impossible at first to pinpoint the source. I quickly snatched my TV remote and muted the volume to make sure that it wasn’t coming from the show I was watching.  The voices of the actors on the screen were silenced, but the music became louder.


When I was 10 years old my parents and I took a trip to Youngstown to see the Barnum and Bailey circus. It was my one and only trip to see the circus and it was magical for my young mind. The entire show was based around the imagery of dragons. My father complained when he had to pay $30 dollars for a stuffed blue dragon, but I had to have it.  


Until that horrific night, I still had that damned blue dragon.  My parents might still have it somewhere. 


I will always remember going to the circus.  I will always remember the lions and the tigers, the motorcycle acts, the high flying stunts, the tricks with the dogs and cats, and especially the silly clowns.


There had been a whole crew of multi-color clowns, doing all kinds of crazy, funny things.  And I will never forget the music that played when the clowns showed up.  It was the typical circus song everyone knows.  


That night in my basement I began to hear the exact same music. 


Entry of the Gladiators.  I googled it because it has been stuck in my head every single day since.


Sounds of rustling and scratching somehow drew my attention away from the impossible music.


My coffee table was a single solid piece of wood that sat directly on the concrete floor, with a hollow space inside for storage that could be accessed by opening the top. Something was moving around on the floor on the other side of it.  From where Micah and I sat, we could not see what it was but we could hear its movement plain as day.


A rat must have gotten in again, I figured.  


But then a pair of hands popped up from behind the coffee table. They were tiny and wearing flawlessly clean, white gloves. I nearly jumped through my skin at the impossible sight. And then when two more pairs of hands appeared, both new pairs indistinguishable from the first, I mentally began to freak out.  I watched in shock as all three sets of hands reached up to grab hold of the far side of the coffee table. 


I kept telling myself that what I was seeing wasn’t real.  It was the acid.  That was just my luck, you know. It was the first time and I was having a bad trip. I repeated this over and over in my head as I watched in stunned silence as three tiny clowns, barely over six inches tall, pulled themself up and onto the top of my coffee table.  They were three duplicates of the same cartoon clown that had been printed on the miniature stamp that I had ingested.  Yellow hair.  Green tophat.  White make-up.  And, of course, a big red nose. The piece of acid paper had only shown me the clown’s face, but now I could see the rest. The clothing, other than the white gloves I had mentioned, was a multicolor jumpsuit that was covered in white polka dots and a set of oversized green shoes.


The many colors vibrated from the clowns, as if screaming in my face. 


Not real.


Not real.


But then my heart nearly stopped when I heard Micah ask me, “Do you see them, too?”


How were we having the same hallucination? 


I didn’t know how to respond to Micah’s question. I simply watched in bewildered silence as the three strange clowns gathered on my coffee table. My coffee table was slightly cluttered, but there was enough room at the center for the trio to stand.  For what felt like forever, the clowns stood still and stared up at Micah and me.  Suddenly, the music that I had nearly forgotten about erupted in a loud clash and crescendo.  


That was when the clowns began to do tricks.


Two of the three clowns began to do a silly dance, arms and feet flying in all directions. The same two occasionally added a sloppy tumble or cartwheel to change up the routine.  It was the most bizarre and unnerving thing I have ever seen.


The third clown stood between the two dancings ones, positioned at the center of the act.  I don’t recall seeing that third clown retrieve balls from anywhere, but as if out of nowhere he began to juggle four different color balls. Every time the center clown caught and then returned a ball to the air, it was a different neon color.


“This LSD is crazy,” Micah mumbled. 


The juggling became faster and faster until it was a bountiful blur of color that melted my senses into a pile of sludge.  It was hypnotizing.  As I sat and watched the balls go round and round, I felt the tingling that had filled my body suddenly fall away, pouring back downward and into the concrete floor. Along with the sensation, my ability to move left me as well.  My muscles tightened and when I tried to make the simplest movement, nothing happened.  I was frozen in place. 


And then, without warning, the dancing stopped and the balls were gone.


Again, all three clowns stood still and stared up at Micah and me, Entry of the Gladiators still playing in the background, like the soundtrack of the mentally insane.  I don't know how long they stood and stared but it felt like hours. 


Sitting on the left side of my coffee table was a white ceramic plate that I had used a couple of days before for the strip steak and baked potato that my mother had cooked.  To be honest, it still sat there because I had been too lazy to return it to the upstairs kitchen to be washed. The plate had long been licked clean, but it still held my fork and knife. 


The knife wasn’t a normal steak knife.  I think that it was closer to a paring knife, a thin blade with a short black handle. The central clown turned its head and looked at the knife. Moving much faster than I had expected, the center clown went over and grabbed the knife from the plate, while the other two remained like statues  Ever the creepy showman, the center clown revealed the knife to his audience, like it was a sharp and deadly show prop.


The center clown then plunged the tip of the knife through the side of Micah’s Mountain Dew can, as if to show us how sharp it was.  As if we didn’t already know. The pop can had been nearly empty and the stabbing didn’t draw any liquid. Removing the sharp knife from the can, the center clown began a sword-swallowing routine. He shoved the knife down his throat several times, deeper down each time until the entire blade was inside of his neck. After the final swallow, he pulled the knife free and bowed.


As if given a cue that I hadn’t seen, the clown on the right rushed toward Micah and lept across from the coffee table to Micah’s lap. Not even a second behind him, the left clown followed behind.  The first clown on Micah’s lap went down on his hands and knees, allowing the following clown to get on his back.  The following clown climbed onto the first clown’s back and then balanced itself while also getting down on hands and knees.  


They were making a step stool, I realized.


The central clown charged and lept onto Micah’s lap.  He swiftly went up the backs of the other two clowns, the paring knife still in hand.  I knew what was coming.  It had been obvious. But I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even turn my head all the way toward Micah, but I could see what was happening from the corner of my vision.


I watched helplessly as the paring knife was shoved into Micah’s left eye.  I swear I heard a wet pop as the blade went in.  I know my friend wanted to scream.  I could see a thick vein bulging in his neck. But the scream was never released.


In a single motion, the central clown pulled the blade free of Micah’s eye and then thrust it deep into Micah’s neck, in the exact spot of the bulging vein. Without removing the knife, the three clowns returned to the surface of my coffee table.  All three of the bastards bowed, their show at its end.  And then...they were gone. One second they were there, bowing, and then the next second they were not. Wherever they returned to, they also took their theme music with them.


Colors began to dull. And I felt the stiffness leaving my muscles. When the use of my body returned to me, that was when I really messed up. That was the point when I needed to use my brain and act smart. But I didn’t. I should have called for help right then, either screaming for my parents or getting on my cell to call an ambulance.  But I didn’t.  My mind was still messed up, and at the sight of my best friend, unconscious from the pain by that point, I panicked. I pulled the knife blade out of Mica’s neck. 


The blood poured so fast.  It was an instant, crimson waterfall.


That was when I finally began to scream. I had never screamed so loud.


I don’t fully remember everything that happened immediately after that.  My parents heard my screams and came flying down into the basement.  I think that I might have still been holding the knife when they found me. The medics showed up first.  But Micah had bled out too fast for them to do anything.  The cops showed up not long after the ambulance. I remember feeling the metal of the handcuffs. And I remember the blinding sea of flashing lights when they put me into the police cruiser. But just like the juggling balls, it was all a blur of motion and color.


I’m sure that I tried to tell them about the clowns right away, but they weren’t listening.  They didn’t believe me.  Not that night or any night since.  They tested Micah’s and my blood and it was easy to find the acid.  And I was the only other person in the basement, so I obviously had to have done it.  


Who else could have?  Right? Open and shut case.


They labeled the murder as Drug-Induced Psychosis.


According to the experts, what Micah and I took was a normal, street-level hallucinogen. But I know the truth. And someone out there has to know it, too. Micah had to have gotten that LSD from somewhere, which means that there is someone else out there that knows about it. Please.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] you.  If you have seen the clown acid or have seen the clowns, tell someone.  Help me.  Please.  Come forward.  I need you to save me. ",3

My dad moved into an apartment down town. I remember the first time I was going to stay at my dad’s for the night. About an hour after being dropped off our neighbor from the house we lived in showed up, ended up making us dinner and stayed the night. Being very young at the time it never crossed my mind as being weird, she was a close neighbor we would hangout with her 2 kids all the time back at the house. Only a week went by and she had fully moved in with my dad, I recall them telling us “the apartment office messed up and put us in the same unit and because we know each other we are just going to accept it for now” again young self didn’t think anything of it, I guess those things happen….(?). 
YEARS went by and my dad and neighbor never admitted to dating or just didn’t mention it. About 11 years later they bought a house together, at this point I was old enough to know they were dating and eventually they did get married and had a kid together. 
It wasn’t until I was about 24 that I told this story to a friend and went “wait a minute…. Apartments don’t screw up like that….” And everything started to make sense. After asking my mom and step mom I found out both of them filed for divorced a week apart from the other. 
I think it’s wild that my entire life it never accured to me that that’s what happened. But now looking back at it I just laugh because of the excuse they tried to use about moving in together. 
Figures i’d share this story because it makes me laugh sometimes that I never noticed what happened ",853
1jdhssi,1742231168.0,2025-03-17 17:06:08,stories,I secretly recorded my professor making sexist remarks and got him fired!,"I (26M) am in my final year of university, and I had a professor let's call him, Dr. R, who always made weird, inappropriate comments. At first, I thought he was just old-fashioned, but over time, I realized he was blatantly sexist.

It started subtly, he would call on male students more often and dismiss female students' answers as ""lucky guesses."" But as the semester went on, his comments became worse. He once said in class, ""Women just aren’t as naturally gifted in logic-based subjects,"" and another time, when a girl asked a question, he laughed and said, ""If female students spent less time worrying about their looks and more time studying, maybe they’d get better grades."" Whenever we had a difficult topic, he’d smirk and say, ""This might be a little hard for the girls, but don’t worry, just smile at your lab partners, and they’ll help you out.""

Then one day, he completely crossed the line. A girl in my class wore a tank top because it was hot outside, nothing inappropriate, just normal summer wear. He paused the lecture and said, ""Wow, dressing like that for extra credit? Bold strategy."" Some people laughed awkwardly, but the girl looked mortified. She barely spoke for the rest of the class.

That was when I decided to start recording. Over the next few weeks, I captured multiple instances of him making sexist comments. The worst was when he joked that women should focus on ""easier"" fields because STEM was ""too stressful for them."" That one pissed me off because there were girls in the class working their asses off, and he was acting like they didn’t belong there.

I compiled everything and submitted it anonymously to the university’s disciplinary committee. They launched an investigation, and within a month, Dr. R was fired.

Now, some of my classmates, mostly the guys, are pissed at me. They say I ""ruined a man’s career over a few jokes"" and that I should have just ignored him. But a lot of the female students have thanked me, saying they’ve been uncomfortable in his class for years.

Edit: My best friend was cursing the person who got him fired in front of me. I told him it was me, and he told this to everyone around.

kgt0gz,1608466180.0,2020-12-20 12:09:40,stories,The Spots of al Fahad: Part 3 of 4,"The question came as soon as they were off their horses that evening, before even setting up the camp.  “And now, my friend, it is time for you to answer my question. Who are you?” Ali asked

William sighed.  “I am [REDACTED_NAME] sure.”

“Then make it simple.  Who are you right now?”

He shrugged.  “I’m William de Quince, an English knight a long way from home.  I’m tired and thirsty and ready to strangle an over-aged adolescent who has no capacity to shut up.”   

That produced a laugh, of course.  “Very good.  We can establish who you are more generally at a later time.”

“Is the rest of my story that hard to figure out?”

“I can guess at some general shapes, but none of the specifics.  But that is of little relevance.  What you are willing to say is as important as what I am [REDACTED_NAME] to hear.”

William looked at the ground.  “It doesn’t seem that it should be hard.”

“In good time, sir.  I can wait until you are ready.”  Ali strode off to get water, leaving William to arrange a fire.   

\_\_\_

He didn’t dream of the leopard that night.  He didn’t dream at all. He went straight from wondering if he wanted to dream to the smell of roasting goat.  He turned a gruff expression towards the young man at the fire.  “Don’t you ever sleep?  You were still out wandering the desert when I went to bed.”

Ali looked back over his shoulder.  “Of course I sleep.  I do so with the same enthusiasm that I do everything else and so I need less of it.  Be happy, my friend, and you will not only enjoy life more, you will have more of it to enjoy.”

”Marvelous,” William grumbled.  “Word games.”

“You just don’t like goat meat and the taste of it has soured your mood.”

“There is nothing particularly wrong with goat meat.  There is nothing particularly right about it, either.”

“You think that it is uninteresting?”  Ali grinned.  “I take that as a most serious accusation.”

“It’s not exciting, certainly.”

“What would be exciting?”

“Whatever the leopard eats.”   

“Why the leopard, William?” Ali asked after a sharp bark of laughter.

He shrugged.  “I saw one a couple of nights ago.  It was eying my horse, but it fled when I approached it.”  

“That is interesting, for leopards are not common around here.  I don’t recommend walking up to one, either.”

“They’re even rarer where I come from.  I wanted a closer look.”

“It does take only one to make an impression,” Ali agreed.  “However, in answer to your question, the leopard has a tendency to eat goats.  So we have come full circle.”

“I’ll try to be excited by breakfast, then.”

“That’s the spirit, my friend.”

William frowned.  “That was a very roundabout way to get me to agree to eat the goat.”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] cunning, Faranj.”  Ali inspected the meat and then put it back to roast longer.  “When I met you, I was considering a visit to some of my cousins.  I have decided that perhaps that is still a good idea, if you will accept my invitation to join me there.”

“I’d prefer not to talk to people.  Yourself excepted, of course.”

“Ah, but that is the beauty of it.  None of them speak Greek, so you won’t be able to talk to any of them.”  

“I have a suspicion that you are tricking me somehow,” William replied.

“Tricking you?  Never. It is nearly four days ride to their town.  You can think about it along the way.  If you decide to decline, we can just not travel the last mile.”

William shrugged, unable to form a decent reason to say no.

\_\_\_

The succeeding days went much the same.  Ali joked and cajoled.  William smiled more and had a harder and harder time remaining sullen.  Ali’s attitude was infectious.

The leopard stayed out of his dreams.

Early on the fourth day, Ali reined to a stop at the crest of a low ridge.  A dusty town spread out at the base of the far side.  William looked down on it, the first settlement, the first other people that he had seen in more than a week.   

“Before I ask you whether you wish to meet my cousins, William, I have a different question.  Truly, what brought you from gray, rainy England to this land?”

The knight continued to look down at the buildings silently.  Many minutes passed, perhaps the longest stretch Ali had gone without speaking since they had met.

“My family died,” he said at long last before lapsing back into silence.   

Ali let his horse drift sideways until their knees touched and offered a slight, easy smile of sympathy.

“I had a wife and four daughters.  Other men kept telling me I needed to have a son.  Anne felt guilty about producing only girls.  I suppose I should have felt the same, but when I looked at them I was incapable of disappointment.  They were so beautiful.”

“What were their names?” Ali asked quietly.

“Guinevere was the eldest.  Then Annabelle, Margaret, and Esther.”

“You will have to tell me about each of them, William, and your wife as well.”

He nodded, but made no effort to say more.  

“We will trade stories of our children.”

William tried to say something and his voice cracked several times before he managed it.  “I was gone.  It was summer, five years ago.  We were campaigning in Wales, a part of the island we haven’t conquered yet.  Nothing else had happened in years so everything seemed safe.

“The Vikings came that summer.  Northmen raiders from across the sea.  They don’t raid like they used to.”  He laughed without a trace of mirth.  “Of course not.  The boldest among them conquered Normandy a century ago. Then they conquered England.  Those were my ancestors.  We were the ones manning the longboats.  My family got rich making the same raids.  It has been fifty years since that many of the Northmen assaulted England as did that summer.  We had all thought that the great raids were a thing of the past.   

“We were in the woods when we got word of the raids.  I wish I could say that I had a vision of doom.  I didn’t.  There is so much coastline. My family was on such a small part of it.  I worried briefly, but dismissed it in favor of worrying about my own life.

“It was three weeks before we got word.  My brother’s manor had been sacked.  No mention of who had been killed or who had survived. I felt fear from that point on.  I couldn’t leave then; what would have been the point?  It was all over, one way or the other.  Alive or dead.

“They were dead, of course.  All five of them.  I don’t know how, exactly.  No one alive saw the attack.  It was sunny when we arrived home.  After an entire summer of rain it was sunny, as if God were mocking me.  I never got to see their bodies.  I went straight to their graves in the churchyard.  The five of them are in a little row.  I would go out there in the middle of the night and lie down.  It was almost as if I could feel them sleeping next to me, but it brought no comfort.

“I came to forget.  I wanted to find a place where I didn’t see them behind every tree.  Where I didn’t hear their voices in every room.  I think I was mad.  I wanted to kill.  I’ve never been like that before.  When I was younger I felt the excitement of combat.  That mix of fear and thrill and the conviction that only your skill at arms will see you through the day.

“But I never really wanted to kill.  I have, I think.  I mean, I think I killed back in England.  I know I have here.  But the battles I was in were all so confused that I could never be sure.  I was always just as happy that it was so.  I could pretend that it was just a game.”

“But this was different.  After they died, I did want to kill.  An anger consumed me.  And so I heeded the Pope’s call to come to this land, to free the Holy Land from the heathens.”  His words were bitter.  “That didn’t matter to me, just the promise of death and distance.”

“That’s why I came: to kill.  That it was your people mattered to me not at all.  And I came to die. It would have been better if I had simply resolved to die and skipped the killing.”

“This world makes the killing very easy, William.”  Ali’s voice was soft.  “Maybe it would be better if we all valued each others’ lives more and our own less, but that would be a different world than this one.”

It was as if he didn’t hear.  “It was as if I was possessed.  I can’t claim that it is true.  I can remember making all of the decisions to slaughter, but it is as if I did so at a distance from my own body.”

“You are wrong, William.  You were possessed.  Perhaps not by Shaitan or his servants.  Perhaps it was just that dark side that we all have within us that took you over and wouldn’t let go.”

“Whatever it was, it left me standing in a church of Jerusalem.  I looked down and saw that I stood in blood up to my ankles.  From right there, without turning my head, I could see three bodies that I could remember killing.  Murdering, really.  That’s what it was.

“What have I become?”

“What have you become, William?  It sounds as if you aren’t any different now than you were before.  The question isn’t what you have become.  It’s whether what you were for a time consumes you.”

“Should it not?”  Anguish twisted his face .  Tempeste shifted uneasily as his hands twisted in the horse’s mane.  “Can there ever be enough good deeds to outweigh the things that I have done?”

“Do not think of a balance, my friend.  No action ever removes another.  They are not sums.”

“Are we never rid of our sins?  Do they weigh on our souls for all time?”

“No, William,” Ali said quietly.  “That is not what I mean at all.  We must let go of our sins.  They are not us.”

“You tell me there is no penance to be paid for sins as grievous as I have committed?”

Ali smiled.  “Let me speak at length, for this is not a simple thought.  Of course there is penance to be done.  But it does not wipe away our sins.  They remain a part of us.  Penance serves two purposes.  It should remind us of our sins so that we do not repeat them, and it should offer recompense to those we have harmed.  Not to remove the sin, but because we owe them a debt.”

“But I do not . . .”

Ali held a finger to William’s lips.  “Hush.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] finished yet.  And it is important to realize that just as you cannot wipe away your sins, neither can they wipe away the good that you do.  You remain the person that loved your daughters in a world that does not always prize little girls as it should.   

“William, you were trying to tell me that you cannot offer recompense to those you harmed.  You do not know who they were or how you could help them now that they are dead.”

“I can’t.”  It was a strangled whisper.

“So you must move on.  What’s done is done and you can’t change any of it.  So you must resolve that you will be a good person going forward.  There is no balance for you to achieve.  That’s a senseless idea.  Just be the best man you can be.”

“How do I avoid becoming that beast again?”

“There are two things that will stop you.  The first is your own conscience.  Now you know what you might do in the extremes of despair.  Even without the second thing, I am [REDACTED_NAME] that you would never behave so again.”

William looked at him dubiously.  “I hope the second thing is more reliable than my own conscience.”

Ali laughed, the first sound of happiness since they had stopped on the ridge.  “It is incredibly powerful, William, for that second thing is me.  Even should your conscience fail, I will not let you descend to those depths again.”

“You would kill me first.”  It wasn’t a question.

“Of course not.”  Ali almost giggled.  “I will make you laugh.  That alone will keep you from evil.”

“Is that all it takes?”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] if you feel that I am [REDACTED_NAME] light of your troubles, my friend.  It is just that I see so much good in you that I cannot help but laugh.”

“I’m glad that one of us can.”

“I will teach you about yourself, William.  Before I am [REDACTED_NAME] with you, you will understand the things that I see.”  He turned and looked down at the town.  “Now, do you wish to meet a small part of my family?”

William de Quince thought for a moment.  “I do.”

\_\_\_

As the two of them approached a compound within the town, a group of children emerged, shouting, “Al Fahad!  Al Fahad!”  Ali jumped off of his horse and scooped one of them up in his arms.  He did so effortlessly despite his slight frame.   

The sound rapidly spoken Arabic assaulted William.  He felt a pang as a swarm of kids surrounded his new friend.  In a strange land it seemed so familiar despite his inability to understand any of the words.  Despite the ache, he felt a sliver of joy watching them.

“You are very popular,” he called to Ali over the din.  That seemed to intensify the curiosity that had been growing among the mob about him.  A couple of the older children, looked up at him, obviously wanting to ask him questions.

Ali said something to them that included William’s name.  It induced more laughter.

“I’m afraid to find out what you just told them about me,” William said.

“I told them that you eat bothersome children,” Ali replied.  “They don’t seem to believe me.”

William swung his leg over the saddle in order to dismount.  He was immediately surrounded by children.  “How many of them are there?”

“I don’t know.  They never stand still enough to count.  It’s half a clan.”

“Only half?”

A middle aged man in white robes emerged from the villa.  “Ali al Fahad!” he yelled, followed by more Arabic.  He strode up to the two of them, eyeing William.

As he approached, Ali said, “This is my cousin Mohammed.  Actually he’s my grandnephew, but to keep things simple, everyone becomes a cousin.”

“How many generations have come after you?”

“We’re on number four.  You’re making me feel old.”  He laughed.

“You are old.”

As Ali and Mohammed conversed, William amused himself making faces at a couple of the bolder children.  They giggled and shrieked as he engaged in a more complex pantomime.  They were interrupted by a sharp comment from Mohammed.  The boys ran back into the villa.  William looked at Ali with an expression of worry.  “Did I do something wrong?”

Ali laughed.  “No, my friend.  It is time for afternoon prayers.  The faithful are supposed to pray to God five times a day.”

“You do not.”

“I said that they are supposed to.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] a good Muslim and sometimes fail in the observances when I am [REDACTED_NAME] my own.  However, I honor God in my heart and while I am [REDACTED_NAME], I do my best to adhere to expectations.  So I will go inside now. You are welcome to follow me and I can show you where you can wait for us to be finished.”

William followed Ali into the cool, moist air that lay behind the villa doors. He was left to sit alone beside a fountain in the shaded courtyard, listening to the burbling of the water. A few minutes later a woman brought him a clay goblet.  “Here you are, my lord,” she said in perfect Greek.

William started.  “Ali said no one here spoke Greek.”

“He is often forgetful, my lord.”

William laughed.  “I am [REDACTED_NAME] a third son.  To call me anything more than ‘Sir’ is to elevate me beyond my station.”

“I prefer to err on the side of caution, my lord.”

“Wise, but I am [REDACTED_NAME] William de Quince, minor knight.  Address me however you will. Shouldn’t you be in praying?”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] like you, Sir William.”

“Ah.  If you will stay with me a moment, I would be interested in talking to someone who knows Ali.”  The water was cold and clear and greatly satisfying.

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] in the kitchen, sir.”

He nodded.  “Perhaps later, then.  What is your name?”

The servant gave him a guarded look.  “Haidee, sir.”

“Well then, Haidee, perhaps I will talk to you later.”

“I look forward to it, sir.”   

Haidee left. William got the impression that she didn’t look forward to it at all.

\_\_\_

William spent most of his time at the villa playing with the children, nine boys of various ages.  With them, the lack of a common language proved to be less of a hindrance.  He started the afternoon just wrestling with them.  The sounds of delight filled the courtyard.

After the exertion had finally taken its toll, one of the older boys produced a chess set.  They passed several hours teaching William the game.  It turned into a team sport, as a couple of them helped the foreigner make his moves.  Despite the help, it took him a while to grasp the object of taking the king.  His confusion did not prevent all involved from enjoying themselves.

It was early evening when Ali came out to rescue him from the hoard.  “You have a way with them, my friend.  We have heard the shouts of joy wherever we go.”  He smiled broadly.

William looked embarrassed.  “It was nothing.”

This only drove Ali to laughter.  “Why do you make so little of it?  Your own pleasure has been as audible as Hamid’s.”  Ali grabbed the shoulder of the most rambunctious of the boys.   

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] to being happy,” the Englishman admitted.

“So very true,” Ali replied, delighted.  “If you do not stop playing, you will be so happy that no one will recognize you.  Fortunately, I have come to save you.  It is time for eating.”  He said something in Arabic to the children, who ran off, the eldest hurriedly collecting his chess pieces and board.

William, suddenly famished, followed closely behind Ali..  “What have you been doing while I was playing,” William asked.

Ali made a sour face.  “Being bored, mostly.  Mohammed wanted to know what things I had seen since I last visited.  He is a good merchant and a good father, but deathly dull to talk to.  He cares nothing for the interesting things in life, just the price of dates in Aleppo or the quality of the carpets for sale in Damascus.”

They arrived in the dining chamber after Ali reminded him to remove his shoes.  Once they were eating, William was astonished at the flavors.  After days of goat meat following a lifetime of English food, he delighted in the varied tastes.  He asked Ali the names and ingredients in dishes and sauces.  He was particularly taken with a mint sauce.  Ali laughed when he put it on everything.   

“Do you always eat like this?” William  asked as a third course was brought in.

“No.  They  turn it into a special occasion when I arrive.”

After a while, William became aware of the attention paid to them by Haidee while she helped to serve the meal.  Anytime he looked, she was staring at one of the two of them.  Though she hid it quickly whenever she saw his gaze turn to her, he caught expressions of dislike and as he conversed with Ali he thought he saw jealousy on her face.

Later, after the meal was complete, William seized an opportunity to speak to her.  “Have I done something to offend?”

“No, sir,” she replied.  Her face dropped into a blank expression.

Unconvinced, he continued.  “I apologize for whatever it is.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] we will not be staying long and Ali will take me back out to the desert.”

“I’m sure, sir.”

The jealousy had reappeared for just an instant and William almost gasped with realization.  “You love him, don’t you?”

“You don’t know anything about it, sir.”

“I saw the way you watch the two of us.”

He almost missed the spasm of anger on her face before she suppressed it.  “There is no point in thinking of what cannot be.”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] that the differences between you are so great.”

Haidee almost snarled in return.  “You have no idea what the differences between us are, or aren’t.”

He was taken aback by the open hostility from a servant and then something dawned on him.  “You think he loves me.”

“I know that he loves you.”   

William pondered the implications of that.  “Of all of the obstacles in your path, I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I am [REDACTED_NAME] the one to worry about.”

Haidee glared at him.  “I repeat, you know nothing about this.”  She turned, ready to leave.

“What does al Fahad mean?” he asked.

She looked over her shoulder at him with eyes empty of spark.  “It means ‘the leopard,’” she said in a hollow voice.  

\_\_\_

They spent another day at the villa, and then rode into the desert again.   “You are smiling and laughing easily, William.  Had I known that family interaction would have this effect on you I would have taken you sooner.”

“Thank you, Ali.  You are right.  It was what I needed.”

“Is there something wrong, my friend?  Where are the loud denials of being happy?”

“I give up.  It’s not worth denying.”

“It is obvious that you like people more than you let on.”

William looked down at his saddle.  “The hatred was an aberration..  Before my family died, I was like this most of the time.  You haven’t so much created this new man as you have dug deeply enough to unbury him.”

“That is good.  I have shown you the desert, William.  Now I wish for you to show me the city.  It has been decades since I have been to Jerusalem.  I rarely travel to any large city these days.  I wish to become reacquainted with large masses of people.”

The knight felt uneasy.  “Are you sure?”

“Of course.  I couldn’t bear for it to be known that you were better at meeting my people than I am [REDACTED_NAME] meeting yours.”

“All right.”  

“As we unbury you, William, it is time to put all of your ghosts to rest.  Jerusalem is the place it must happen.  Along the way, tell me of your daughters and your wife.  Let them no longer be a burden on your heart, but share them so that they carry it instead.”

“Are you a poet?”

“Sometimes.  I’ve tried my hand at almost everything over the years.  Except fishing.  I’m afraid of boats.”

William almost choked.  “You’re afraid of something?”

“I am a land creature.  I can cross a river, even swim it, if I need to.  But to go where I can’t see the shore?  That terrifies me.  If the boat sinks, which way would I swim?”

“Any direction will do if you can swim well enough.  You’ll always reach land eventually, if you go in a straight line.”

“I am [REDACTED_NAME] by your confidence in my abilities.  Still, there is only one thing that could get me to cross the sea.”

“And what is that?”

Ali looked at him with a sly smile.  “Only if I wanted to go to some place surrounded by the sea, someplace to which I couldn’t walk, would I willingly traverse the water.”

“Like England.”  William’s voice was even.

“Like England.  I will see it someday.”

There was a stretch of silence.  “I don’t think I want to go back,” William said at last.  “Nothing remains for me there except bitter memories.  It is better for me to remain here.”   

“That is understandable, my friend.  If you change your mind, I will accompany you.  If not, I shall make the voyage someday without you.  I am [REDACTED_NAME].  Even if I must wait until you are in paradise, I would see your homeland.”

“Do you truly think that we will be together so long?”

Ali drew his horse to a stop.  “You spoke with Haidee at the villa.”  It was a statement.

“I did.  She is jealous and said things whose meaning was unclear to me.”

Ali chuckled.  “You understood the meaning of them perfectly well, William.  You are merely uncomfortable at that meaning.”

“I suppose.”  He stumbled over his next sentences.  “I mean, I have heard of such things between men.  I have even known a couple . . . I mean, a few . . . who I suspected of lying with each other, but . . .”

Ali’s mirth only grew louder.  “I appreciate your bravery in not shying away from the subject, William, but love can take many forms.  It does not require us to lie together.”

“I suppose, but . . .”  His sentence ended in a sputter.

“Your face has turned a delightful shade reminiscent of a cherry.”

William stopped trying to speak and just glared.

“Haidee was unusually wicked to you, my friend.  I see no need to be embarrassed about the thoughts you are having, but if any of us should be embarrassed, it is her, not you.”

He managed to choke out an answer.  “What do you mean?”

“I enjoy making you puzzle out my secrets, William, but I will share the second with you if only to reduce your confusion.”  Ali repeated the method of dismounting he had shown on their first meeting, flowing through the handstand and then the flip onto his feet.

“Haidee failed to share with you one vital piece of information.  This is the source of your confusion.”  He lifted his tunic over his head.  “I am [REDACTED_NAME], for it allows me to reveal it myself, though I’m sure this will only replace one form of confusion with another.”

As Ali stepped out of his trousers, William regained his voice.  “What are you doing?”  He pulled on the reins, directing his horse away from the undressing Arab.

Ali stood in his shirt and underclothes.  “I am [REDACTED_NAME] you something, silly man.  Something I very much doubt you would believe if I just told you.  Stop running away.  There is nothing to be frightened of.”  He removed the blue shirt, revealing a small pair of breasts.

William watched, transfixed.

“I’m sure you can guess what’s coming,” Ali said.  He took off the last of his clothes, standing in the sand wearing nothing but sandals and a turban.   

Except that ‘he’ was nothing of the sort.  “I am a woman, William.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] truly Ali.  I just go by that in my travels.  My name is [REDACTED_NAME]’ad, which means ‘Bringer of Happiness’ in our language.  My parents named me well, don’t you concede?”

William sat on his horse, unsure what to say.

“May I get dressed again, William?  The sun is very hot today.”

Willilam nodded, unsure of his voice.

“Thank you.”  Is’ad continued to talk as she did so.  “So that is how you should take the revelation that I love you.  Perhaps it shouldn’t make a difference, but to you it does.”

“Why?” William asked at last.

“Have you not learned that that is a broad question that can lead uncomfortable places?  Why do I love you?  Why did I reveal myself just now?”

“Why do you pretend?”

“Ah, you meant it in a simple way.  Is that not obvious?  Does the life I enjoy seem to you like one that the world would allow a woman?”

“No,” he conceded slowly.

“I pretend to be a man because you have a freedom that a woman can never enjoy.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] to roam the desert.  I can make unscheduled stops to visit family.  Do you think that I could have lived a century and more with my life limited in the ways it would be if I remained Is’ad for all to see?”

William shook his head.  “But Haidee knows.  And your son knows.”

Is’ad laughed.  “My whole family knows, and more.  It is not hard to discover that the ancient one who wanders the desert is female, if you are curious.  What I call my secrets were really just secrets from you, not others.”

“But if they know, then how does it work?”

“We pretend.  There are zealots out there who object, but they are few.  There are more who disapprove but lack the courage to say so openly.  I found though, that most people care more for the appearance of propriety than they do for propriety itself.  So long as they can pretend that I am [REDACTED_NAME], they don’t concern themselves with who I actually am.”

“Is it ever difficult to pretend to be someone else?”

“Almost never.  I know who I am [REDACTED_NAME] I can give people what they want.  I have played the role of Ali for so long that it is easy to do.  It saddens me that women are held in the roles assigned to them.  I am [REDACTED_NAME] in how I was allowed to find my freedom.  Once I was in my thirties but still looked sixteen, I think my family was grateful that I found a way not to be there.  I was an oddity before I decided to be a man.”

“I suppose.”  William grinned.  “And besides, there is one more secret still unknown, by me at least.  I cannot yet guess it, but may I assume that it only added to the oddity?”

“You may assume what you wish, William.  I will not confirm it, but there is that possibility, of course.”

“Very well.  I will take you to Jerusalem, but only if you promise me not to reveal that you’re a woman.  I’m going to have enough questions to answer as it is.”

“I can do that, William.”

The Englishman took a deep breath.  “I don’t know if I love you, yet.”

Is’ad nodded as she remounted her horse.  “That is fair.  Besides, I still have a secret left.”",2

dmtwv9,1571988339.0,2019-10-25 07:25:39,stories,Journal of a Night-Walker [Part 1],"I always wanted to save people.

I was diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome when I was 3. For those of you who do not know what this is, it’s a mental disorder which essentially initiates a deep urge within somebody to say and do whatever comes to their head, regardless of the consequences. 

Through the years, I came to learn that I also had ADD (attention deficit disorder) and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). Needless to say, these disorders always showed on the outside. I would never pay attention in class/zone-out constantly, I would overly obsess over stupid little things like numbers and positions of objects, and I would blurt out unintentional insults at people, often not realizing the effects my words had on others. I think I may have had a mild Asperger’s complex in there somewhere.

These disorders carried on throughout the years. Some people used my naivety and chemical imbalances to take advantage of me (physically and emotionally). These were some pretty dark times that I don’t really feel like going into right now. But the point is, it completely destroyed any emotional attachment I had to anyone. Even with my family. I never really understood the concept of emotional detachment, so I always thought I was weird and psychopathic. Now I realize I was probably undergoing the effects of trauma.

Every time I try to bring up my issues with my family, they tell me to leave my past in the past and stop being so sensitive about things I can’t change. That always stings. When I was younger, I was a lot harder to control mentally, so my parents resorted to tough love. When I started improving drastically, I think they held onto their old ways out of habit. All I need is emotion. Someone to talk to without feeling like an overly-sensitive cry-baby. Sometimes I begin to think maybe my parents are right, and maybe I‘m not justified in feeling tormented all the time.

This led to crippling loneliness. I always had people I talked to at school, but I was never close with any of them. They’re all bad guys. They screw each other and do drugs all day and talk shit about each other. They’re absolute animals. I was forced to mature early when I was younger; if I didn’t back then, I’d probably be dead. Being around kids who don’t understand how the real world works and constantly complain about their problems like they’ve just been through war is infuriating. Never being able to relate to any of them is detrimental to me. I feel like an outsider all the time. I’ve got all this real world knowledge in my head, and I can’t share it with anyone because they won’t listen.

I don’t talk a lot at school. I plug in my earphones and listen to electric synth. That type of music has always been my favorite. It makes me feel complete. I like feeling complete.

I’m 15. I’m just a kid, and I’ve dealt with what most adults go through in their 30s. But I’m not a complainer. Complaining about your problems makes them harder to maintain.

I always looked to the movies for inspiration and advice, because the real world didn’t give me any of that. I felt like these characters in the movies were the only ones who truly understood me. I started adopting their traits and making my life like a movie. The movies were all I had.

The depression was getting worse. I felt slower and less able, and I really wanted to stop trying. Sometimes, I felt like not being here might make the pain little easier. But then I saw this one movie. In it, there was a guy with all my problems, but in the end he became a helper. He had all this stuff, and all he wanted to do was protect people.

I started taking night walks, looking for people to save, in some desperate attempt to seek redemption for all the people I had hurt and lost. It became an obsession. I even started exercising to build strength. I began to get fitter and stronger, and I felt more capable.

The things I saw and were exposed to at a young age really opened my eyes. I knew how cruel the world could get. I completely understood the concept of morality before I even finished sophomore year. I knew that these things could happen at any time, even around where I was. Maybe one night, something like that could happen. I wanted to be there to prevent it.

For the longest time, I had a fantasy about dying during one of my crusades. I would die while saving a life, and that would be the end of my story. The fear of dying a loner with no one would be lifted, and I would have died doing something good. Sometimes I wished that would happen.

I developed a sort of costume. A jacket with a golden emblem on the back. Not very original, but it was a symbol. Every time someone saw me walking in the street, I wanted them to feel protected. I wanted them to know that the Night Walker was there to help them.

A short period after I started these walks, I met a group of people. Somehow I connected with them. That loneliness started to lift a little bit. I met a girl in there. We’re talking now. I’ve been hurt before, and I’m watching my back, but she feels a little different. I guess we’ll see.

I didn’t stop the walks. Even though I finally found a shred of happiness and hope, I didn’t stop walking around, looking for people to rescue. That told me something. I felt as if maybe I wasn’t doing it for me anymore. Maybe I was doing it to keep the symbol alive. I no longer wanted to die.

I stumbled upon a duo of horny teenagers (boy and girl) smoking weed the other night, up in the top section of a playground. They reminded me of the kids at school. I felt a sort of obligation to do something. I walked up the steps of the structure super slow to evoke fear, found them at the top, then told them: “You’re not sneaky.” Never saw them there again after that.

This other time, I called in a stray cat to its owners. His name was Milo. I guess he liked wandering from time-to-time, but I wanted to make sure. I spent about 20 minutes with him. Somehow, I related to him. We were both lonely things walking in the night, and we found each other. In a really weird way, I felt like I had finally found a friend. They came and got him. I never saw him again after that, but I’d like to think he remembers me. I remember him.

I’m not seeking glory or anything. I’ve purposely never told anyone about what I do at night. I’m never revealing my real identity on here. No one needs to know who I am. All they need to know is the symbol on my back and know that someone’s looking out for them.",0
1jfmty9,1742470606.0,2025-03-20 11:36:46,stories,My fiancé told me she was going on a girls' trip—so I had her plane ticket redirected.,"
If you only read the title, I might sound like a controlling jerk. But I promise you, I’m not.

I’ve been with my fiancée, Rachel, for three years. We got engaged six months ago, and everything seemed perfect—until I started noticing little things. Sudden late-night meetings, a new password on her phone, and the biggest red flag: a “girls’ trip” she was oddly secretive about.

I wasn’t the jealous type, but something didn’t sit right. So, I did something I never thought I’d do—I checked our shared airline account. Turns out, her “girls' trip” was actually a solo ticket to a tropical resort… booked under her name and another man’s. I recognized his name. A “friend” from work.

I didn’t confront her right away. Instead, I got to planning. I quietly canceled her ticket and rebooked it… to her parents' house. Same departure time, just a very different destination. I also compiled all the evidence—screenshots, texts I found on her old tablet, and even a few Venmo transactions that made things obvious.

The day of the trip arrived. I drove her to the airport, kissed her goodbye, and watched as she confidently walked inside. I had one of my friends tail her to see the moment she realized she wasn’t heading to paradise with her affair partner.

Her first call came 20 minutes later. I ignored it. The frantic texts followed:

Rachel: “Why is my ticket wrong??”
Rachel: “Where are my bags??”
Rachel: “DID YOU DO THIS???”

I didn’t reply. Instead, I group-texted her, her parents, and her older brother with a simple message:

“Hey, Rachel’s on her way to see you. She has something important to explain. Check your emails for the full story. Hope she has a great stay.”

Then, I blocked her number.

I don’t know how things went when she landed, but judging by the hundred missed calls from her and a few from her mom… I’d say it wasn’t pretty. Meanwhile, I changed the locks, packed up her things, and had them delivered to her parents' place.

I spent that weekend with my best friends, having the celebratory drinks I didn’t know I needed.

So yeah, Rachel did go on a trip—just not the one she planned.

If you only read the title, I might seem like a petty employee. But trust me, this was long overdue.

I’ve worked at my company for two years. My boss, Mike, had a habit of dumping extra work on me at the last minute. Always after hours. Always ""urgent."" At first, I thought it was normal, but then I noticed a pattern. My coworkers never got these late-night emails. Just me.

One night, he told me I had to stay late to finish a report he conveniently ""forgot"" to assign earlier. I had plans. I pushed back. He got weirdly aggressive, hinting that my dedication would ""affect my future here.""

That’s when I started digging. I searched my inbox and found months of these ""urgent"" emails. Most weren’t even necessary. Some even contradicted deadlines he had given others. Then I remembered something. HR had mentioned during onboarding that all emails were backed up on the company server.

So, I did what any overworked employee would do. I forwarded everything to HR with a polite inquiry:

""Hey, I just wanted some clarification. I seem to be receiving significantly more after-hours requests than my peers. Is this standard practice?""

I didn’t hear anything for a week. Then, out of nowhere, Mike called me into his office. He looked pale. HR had flagged the pattern, compared workloads, and found a lot more than just unfair treatment. Turns out, Mike had been diverting work from his own responsibilities onto me while claiming credit for my results.

A week later, an all-company email announced that Mike was ""moving on to new opportunities.""

I left at 5:00 PM sharp that day.

ayhpuw,1551992809.0,2019-03-07 21:06:49,stories,True story that happened to me about waking up in the middle of a surgery,"So at the time of this event, I was 13.

(TD;DR At The bottom)

So I had been an adventurous kid for most of my life, always doing all the dares I got, Stunting, and anything else a Cool Kid Wannabe would do to impress their friends. So for my birthday (in August.) I got A hoverboard, Since this was 2017 that was the new ""Big Thing"" Back then. My parents were Overprotective then (Idk If that was a good thing or not) But they would always tell me to wear my helmet when I was on it. Now, Me being the Defiant Teen I am, I would not always listen to them about this. So I would be wearing my helmet when they were around, But not when they were not.

&#x200B;

Well, everything was fine until October 10 of that year, I was outside siting with my uncle and the neighbors, riding my hoverboard (W/O a helmet), Then I hit a rock and fall face-first into the concrete (we had a porch, but no front yard).

Upon getting up, My head was bloodied from the impact. I was dizzy from hitting the concrete. so about 5 Hours later my parents come home (they were at a conference) and they see the dried up blood on my head. So naturally they ask what happened, so I had to fork over the fact that I fell off my hoverboard face-first into the concrete, and without a helmet.

&#x200B;

So them being the overprotective parents they were, they took me to the hospital and.... I had a concussion. (5th in 2 1/2 years) Since it was the 5th in a pretty short amount of time they insisted on getting a MRI (Magnetic Research Imaging) and a ct scan ( Computed tomography scan) and when they came back, my life was shattered. A tumor had grown (golf Ball size). It had grown behind my eye, meaning that the surgery to remove it was necessary. it would be a risky operation, considering that they had to move a lot of brain around to navigate to it. 

&#x200B;

So around November, I had gotten a date for the surgery, December 28th, 3 days after Christmas. So on Christmas day, I felt sick (Always get sick around this time), But it turned out to be bronchitis. So with me being sick, They postponed it.

&#x200B;

Then, On February 12th, I had the surgery. it would be 17 hours. I thought it was going to be easy to get over. but was I wrong. so I went in and everything was fine, until 6 hours in, then I woke up Mid surgery. IT. WAS. TERRIFYING. Although I could not feel any pain, It was still scary. I remembered pressure on the back of my eye from where I'm [REDACTED_NAME] they were looking for a way to get it out. But then they realized i was awake then put more sedative in my IV.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I get surgery and wake up in the middle, then recall my story on Reddit.",9
gd65s0,1588572700.0,2020-05-04 06:11:40,stories,Oaths: A tale of two brothers. Ch 1.7," 

Riverstead was nothing like the brothers' home. Where their home was fewer than 100 huts, and just shy of three times that many residents. This town- and a town it was; it was far too large to be a simple village by the brothers' reckoning. It had walls, and was the size of their tribe's home, magnified ten times over.

They were awestruck, they had never seen so many people, it felt like the sum of their tribe was working just the fields outside the walls. To say nothing of the various pillars of smoke and foot traffic that told of more significant numbers.

Its entry was fortified, a triangle fortification that forced anyone coming through the entrance of the town to pass through two gates. On its points stood watchtowers from which guards spectated the incoming travelers wearily.

Major, for his part. Was unphased by the small town and its wooden walls that had impressed the brothers so.

They had traveled through the gate and immediately received an example in the ridiculous variety of humans. A trade caravan was ahead of them, and while they were sure at least *some* of them weren't humans, Major consistently pointed out each of the odd creatures as humans.

A tall man, about as tall as the brothers. But lanky with long ears that wouldn't have been unfit on a rabbit. He seemed to have bark growing on his exposed flesh.

Major pointed him out as being elven in heritage, but more human than not.

Another sported crimson skin and was missing the horns and facial hair that the residents of Riverstead wore. Furthermore, a prehensile tail came from her backside that swayed and danced about as she spoke with the first man.

The rest of the caravan’s members seemed to be of Elven ancestry. They stood tall and watchful with bows and spears. And the shorter red-skinned and tailed humans who milled about them, cheerfully chattering all the while, laden with bags.

They followed the caravan in, passing through the gates and being stopped at the second by a couple of guards. Both were tall for the natives of the town so far as the brothers could tell, But they were towered over by the trio.

The leading guard thumbs the hilt of his sword before clearing his throat and addressing them.

""Purpose for your visit?""

""Travelers, passing through."" Major rumbled back.

The guard hummed back skeptically, looking the brothers up and down, his eyes lingering on their weapons.

""A silver for entry.""

Major blinked, then scowled slightly before reaching into a coin pouch and producing a silver piece.

""Each."" the guard spoke, now eyeing the brother's scales.

Major squinted at the card ""It was three copper for a party of two last time I came through here.""

The guard shrugged. ""Times are tough.""

Major sighed. ""I see."" and promptly reached into his coin pouch and fished out another two silver pieces.

The guard smiled, pocketed the two new pieces, and spoke. ""Well, go on then.""

Major nodded, gave a half-hearted 'Good day.' and continued past the gate, waving the brothers after him.

As they cleared the second gate, Major could be faintly heard mumbling. ""Maybe I will start selling my skills again.""

The brothers barely heard him, but 'barely' meant they had.

""Major, we don't *need* your money. We can manage.""

""Oh, don't ya start that nonsense again. That ain't why I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. If times really are tough, then I expect the local herbalist will be up-charging as severely as the guards. And I can't much tolerate people up-charging on needed healing supplements.""  
He rubbed his chin and spoke again. ""Imma see if I can't speak to the old Anverth. He's the man to go to for that sort of thing here unless my memory fails me. Ya'll wander about, be careful of spending any money. I'll meet ya at the Inn later, I'll bring that paper and get you those recipes I promised."" With a wave, the ogre began to talk off, mumbling about 'price gouging' all the while.

The brothers bid him a farewell, and then turned to each other. With a shrug, they began to listlessly wander into the town.

It didn't take long for them to realize they must be terribly unique in these parts, despite their tribe being only two day’s travel in good weather.

And while trade between the town and the tribe did occur, it usually happened with the traveling caravans such as the one they had entered with. It often wasn't worth the price of entry to the Drakon when they could simply wait on the outside for a Caravan to arrive. The caravans were more likely to give better trades for the regional furs the tribe traded. And wouldn't demand to buy them with the 'money' that was mostly useless to the tribe's hunter/gatherer society.

All this led into the cumulative effect of Drakon being rather rare sights in the town of Riverstead, and it showed in the wonder and fear the residents looked at the brothers with.

The brothers, for their part. Mostly replied in kind.

The beautiful carved and decorated horns that some of the folk had drew their eyes as inevitably as gold would draw a dragon's. And the occasional rare human who was unlike their dark or green-skinned counterparts.

This had allowed the brothers to start seeing the similarities even in very different looking humans. Most notably in their faces. While they came in all colors, facial hair, and clean-shaven; they were always these... strange flat things, and so *expressive.* The humans seemed to be easier to read than books.

And specific stories about them were being proven correct. The tribe educators had told them that humans had a strange and bizarre obsession with animals.

They were right, there were animals everywhere. Dogs huddled in alleys, half-starved. But for as many they saw in that condition, there were just as many healthy. Laying on porches or walking alongside their masters, tails wagging.

And every now and then, they could see humans throw scraps even the scrawny and mangy looking hounds, the ones that clearly weren't even *theirs*.

Not to mention the horses, which they had seen lined up in a strange horse house of some sort. That had been quite flighty as the brothers approached.

And then there were the cats, they walked along the roofs, and it felt like they couldn't go more than two dozen paces without seeing one.

The tribe could not have afforded to feed so many… unneeded animals, and most would have likely been food, rather than be fed.

They watched in quiet wonder as a young- or perhaps just particularly short human, crouched down and began making a clicking noise while holding out a bone of some sort.

The dog that the human had been tempting ventured from the porch it had been lazing upon and lolloped over to the small human and barked eagerly. And after a moment of seemingly friendly taunting, The human raising the bone just out of reach of the house. They finally dropped it for the dog to maul.

Bewildering.

The brothers continued their exploration. Supposedly they were supposed to meet Major at an Inn. Yet, any time they approached a human for directions they quickly walked away.

""Maybe there is some... greeting, we don't know about?"" Asgar asked

Argus thought for a moment, then replied. ""Surely, Major would have told us this?""

Asgar shrugged. ""Maybe he does not know?""

His brother hummed thoughtfully. ""No, that doesn't sound right. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure he'd know something like that.""

Asgar nodded. ""Maybe everyone is just busy?""

The brothers looked over the suddenly empty street.

""That makes sense.""

""How do we find the 'Inn' then.""

""I don't know.""

Asgar looked puzzled. ""Brother, can I ask you a question?""

""Yes.""

""Do you know what an 'Inn' is?""

""...No.""

""It sounds important.""

""Yes, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure it's said with a capital 'I'""

""So a big building then?""

""Yes.""

The brothers, not entirely confident. But with a vague sense of a plan, began to go looking for the most prominent building.

—-

""Please stop disturbing the townsfolk.""

A half dozen guards had approached the brothers mid-search. Apparently, they were 'disturbing the peace' by knocking on the fanciest buildings they could find.

They had been 'fined' two copper for this, and the brothers suspected that this was one of the 'scams' Major had warned them about. But there were six guards, and it was easier to fork over the orangeish coins than pick a fight neither brother really wished to have.

On the bright side, the guards had finally pointed them towards the 'Inn' after warning that any other 'disturbances' would lead to a night in the 'cell.'

The brothers understood almost none of this beyond a vague idea that night in the 'cell' would not be pleasant.

And they felt their opinions of humans fall a bit in general if they were so 'disturbed' by giving out directions. But perhaps humans were just rather shy? There had been shy drakon at their tribe, maybe that was just normal for humans.

Their father had been quite stern with them as children when they'd tried to make Ingram- the smith's son, play outside with them. Ingram was particularly shy.

Perhaps the guards had been chastising them as their father had for bothering shy folk.

The brothers chewed these thoughts over as they approached the 'Inn' which- as the guards had informed them, apparently had *two* names. It was also known as 'The Mug and Cloak' which not only seemed needlessly confusing, but also seemed to be a worse name than 'The Inn' to the brothers.

Eventually, they found the building. It didn't list the word 'Inn' anywhere. It did, however, have a sign on which a picture of an overfull mug was painted. It swung slightly above the entrance.

""Where is the cloak?""

Argus squinted at the sign, which was missing any sort of image of any garment. much less a cloak like the name of the place suggested there should be. ""Maybe they sell cloaks?""

""Did Major want to buy a cloak?""

The brothers thought of the giant ogre purchasing anything from the comparatively small humans and having it fit and shook their heads.

""Maybe he wants us to buy a cloak?""

""Why?""

Asgar thought, before snapping his fingers with a soft metallic *tang*, ""So we can hide our scales, he said they were rather valuable.""

The brothers shivered at the idea of being *descaled* so someone could use them as coins or make armor out of it.

""But why didn't he say so? didn't he say to be careful about purchasing things?""

""He did say he would meet us here, perhaps he intended to help us purchase them?""

""Ah... this makes sense."" Argus nodded, satisfied with his brother's deduction.

They stood in silence before Asgar finally asked. ""...Do we just wait outside for him? Or go in?""

Argus looked at his brother, and then at the 'Inn.' ""We go in, of course, Major won't be around to adventure with us always. New frontiers brother. we took Oaths after all.""

""Right.""

The brothers walked forward confidently, only partially feigning it.

They opened the door to the Inn.

""Why hello there, how can I help- Oh!"" The Inn was warm and welcoming. It reminded them of Major’s cabin but clearly meant for many more people to live in. It was absolutely full of tables and chairs, around and on them sat two dozen humans of various breeds. Most commonly, the natives, but the red-skinned traders and their tall bark-covered guards, were also inside; most of which watched the brothers intently. A bar sat in the back of the room. Though neither brother could identify the odd piece of furniture. Or would have recognized the word 'bar' in this context, for that matter.

Behind the Bar stood a petite green-skinned human woman, with thinly cut mutton chops and a pair of short two-inch horns. A small bell hung from her leftmost horn.

There were also no cloaks, or again. Any other types of garments. Besides, of course, the ones they people inside were wearing, but the brothers doubted those were for sale.

The Innkeeper finally seemed to recover from her surprise.

""Well, uh. Hello there! what do you need?""

""...Cloaks?""

""Oh! Thank Soltris. You'll want to go to the tailor for that. He's down the street from here.""

The brothers looked at the woman, then at each other.

""I think we were wrong.""

Argus nodded gravely. ""So, we just wait here for Major to come and clarify what he meant then?""

Asgar nodded, then turned to the Innkeeper. ""We need to wait here for a friend of ours."" then promptly took an empty seat and table.

""Uh... well..."" She looked around, her friendly smile straining as a handful of customers chose to exit. Then looking back at the pair of Drakon. The BIG Drakon, with weapons, and covered in shiny scales that could probably turn arrows.

""...Ok.""

—-

""Asgar?""

""Yes, Argus?""

""You have heard the saying, 'chewed things over'. Yes?""

""Yes, I have heard this saying at least once today.""

""Why is this saying?""

""I think it is supposed to mean 'talking' about something.""

""But that is not chewing.""

""No, but talking is like chewing. Hence the comparison.""

""Hm, this makes sense. I think I was misusing the saying.""

Asgar nodded, he too, felt like he'd been misusing the saying. He hadn't been talking much at all.

In fact, it had become terribly quiet in the Inn. The only people inside now were the brothers, the Innkeeper, and one or two locals in the far corners of the Inn quietly eating.

Which the brothers suspected was pretty good timing, as the Innkeeper presently had her head resting into the bar. Occasionally she would look up and around and scowl at the empty room.

She had quickly gone from cheerful and full of energy to this lethargic state. Clearly, she needed rest. As she reminded the brothers of Ingrim when he had been up all night smithing, and the rest of the tribe for the matter when the sound of smithing kept them up all night.

Despite her apparent sleepiness, she was still a very courteous host. Continually asking the brothers if they'd like anything to eat or drink. The brothers politely refused, of course, they were already taking up one of her tables. They couldn't take her food too!

Maybe this is why the guards had been upset with them for disturbing people, if humans suddenly swung into this scowling sleepiness. It would make sense that it would be rather rude to disturb them.

Perhaps the Innkeeper should go rest if she was so tired. She must have a bed somewhere to sleep in, Argus decided to ask.

He broke the silence, speaking. ""Where would you find a bed to use?""

The Innkeeper looked up from the bar, squinting at him and scowling. ""Are you serious?""

Argus nodded gravely, she seemed annoyed. He hoped she didn't think he was mocking her. ""One does get tired after a long night and should know when to rest.""

She seemed confused, before shaking her head. ""This is an Inn.""

""Yes, I know this.""

""...Inns rent rooms.""

She had to pay for her own room? ""How much are rooms?"" Argus asked with a rising brow.

She seemed to freeze for a minute, thinking for a moment. If she was struggling to remember room prices, she must be exhausted, maybe he could talk her into letting him watch the Inn for her so she could sleep in peace?

""For you, one gold.""

...

""One gold?!""

She nodded, staring intently at him.

That was ridiculous, was she being scammed? But they were her rooms, weren't they? ...No, of course, they weren't. Otherwise, she'd surely be sleeping in one now.

Argus turned to his brother, switching from the merchant’s tongue and speaking in their tribe's native language. Which now felt oddly foreign over the week or so they'd spent speaking in nothing but Merchant's tongue.

""Brother, I think she's getting scammed.""

""I thought that could only happen to us?""

""Unless Major was very wrong about the value of the gold pieces, that room must cost hundreds of meals.""

""Maybe whoever buys it gets to keep it permanently?""

Argus suddenly felt very silly for jumping to conclusions and cleared his voice. Then spoke to the Innkeeper in the Merchant's tongue. ""How long does one keep the room for one gold?""

""A day,"" she said in a firm tone of voice that made it clear it was absolutely out of her hands.

He turned to his brother again. ""I was right, she is being scammed. She only gets it for a day.""

Asgar hummed. ""Maybe she is wealthy? She has been offering to give us food, and we're not exactly invited guests.""

As the brothers discussed, a voice broke out, one of the residents rising from their table.

""Come now, Beatrice, that's hardly kind to charge them such rates.""

The man who spoke had magnificent ram-like horns and a full beard. His skin was a hue of bronze with hardly a hint of green. He wore a white robe, and on his chest was the symbol of a yellow orb being circled by another.

If one looked closely, they would be able to see little specks of yellow lightly peppered over the robe as a whole.

""They cleared out my bar Sol! And they won't buy anything! They just sit there talking about chewing things!""

""This is an Inn. They are travelers. You cannot pick and choose who you offer sanctuary too.""

""I damn well can if they're gonna run me out of business! They scared off everyone! Even the caravan folk- they were from Goldhome, Sol. They *tip* there!""

""Even still, a gold? You can't really expect them to be able to afford that.""

The Innkeeper suddenly looked like she was at her wit's end. That's when the brothers stood as one, making the Innkeeper jump and suddenly look nervous, even the man in the strange robe eyed them wearily.

The brothers bowed their heads to the Innkeeper, as Argus put a pair of silver pieces on the table they were sitting at. ""Our apologies, I believe we misunderstood the purpose of this place."" and promptly about-faced, and going out the door.

""Oh."" The Innkeeper spoke softly.

—-

Now outside Argus was caught between feeling guilty and fuming.

""She tried to 'scam' us,"" He mumbled hotly.

""Apparently, we were making her quite upset,"" Asgar replied.

""Why?""

His brother shrugged. ""I do not really understand, either. But we did make her upset, and it was her home.""

Argus deflated somewhat. ""I know... but... she seemed kind, What did we do?""

A voice interrupted their discussion. ""Nothing. Intentionally, anyway.""

The brothers started, then turned as the robed man the Innkeeper had called Sol approached them.

""What do you mean?""

""Do you really not know?""

The brothers shook their heads, now staring at him.

The robed man chuckled. ""Ha, I thought myself reasonable. And yet I find I also judged too hastily.""

He cleared his throat. ""My apologies, it just seems rather obvious from my point of view, it is... endearing that you are unaware, I suppose. But I will stop beating around the bush.""  
He took a moment, seemingly chewing over his words. Finally bringing both of his hands together and pointing at the brothers with his index fingers. ""You are... terrifying.""

""What?"" Argus asked.

""You are absolutely terrifying."" He repeated,

""What do you mean, why?"" Argus looked down at himself, almost as if he were looking for whatever the man saw that he didn't.

""You are a giant, bulky..."" He seemed to be choosing his words very carefully. ""-person, covered in scales that shine like armor. You have a mouth that I suspect I could fit my entire head into, and visible talons on your hands and feet.""

The brothers stared at him, perplexed. ""Yes, this is true.""

He tapped his foot before sighing and speaking. ""I suppose you still don't quite get it, perhaps it's a good thing. and I apologize if what I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to say hurts you... but you look like monsters, predators, killers.""

The brothers looked at each other, blinked, studying each other. Noting the various parts he mentioned. Then looking at him, who stood two heads shorter than either of them, Then observing his own rounded nubby fingers. The boots that hid his feet, which they could only assume were also without claws. And his teeth were weirdly flat. Only four seemed to have any kinda point to them, and that was likely the orcish blood in him.

It was now that the differences between him and the orcs they had fought were most apparent. While the orcs also had rounded fingers, they had been muscled, far more than any human they'd seen. Even the guard had a series of flat teeth. The orcs had terrible pointed things that likely were used for rending flesh.

The soft brown of this man's eyes was easy to read. They seemed to emit empathy, caution, and yet, to some degree, fear. The orcs eyes had quite literally glowed with bloodlust.

""I see."" Argus finally spoke. He seemed to deflate even more, and even his Oath seemed like it was mournful. It was meant to be a light and inspire hope, not fear.

Sol looked somewhat ashamed. ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to be the one to tell you. My kind varies depending on where you are, in both appearance and culture. Perhaps somewhere they would gladly welcome you with open arms. But here? You will struggle if you intend to stay long.""

Asgar patted Argus on the back, before turning to Sol and saying. ""Thank you for telling us. We were prepared to be scammed, lied to, all manner of things. But Major didn't warn us that they'd fear us.""

""Is this 'Major' one of you?""

Asgar shook his head. ""No, an ogre, with some mixed heritage.""

""Ah, I suspect he didn't know then.""

Asgar nodded.

Sol stepped from one foot to the other awkwardly before clearing his throat. ""Since I doubt you can afford the Inn, I have a home. I live with my mother, but she’s open-minded. Probably more so than me. You'd be welcome.""

Asgar hadn't really thought of where *they* would sleep till the fiasco of the Inn, and a small part suggested he was perhaps relying on Major too much.

""We may have to take you up on that offer... Sol, correct?""

""Yes, and you are?""

""Asgar and this is Argus.""

""A pleasure to meet you both though I wish it would have been better circumstances.""

The brothers responded with a nod for courtesy.

""If you wish to come to my home now, you may. if not, you can find me in the Sanctum of Light.""

""Sanctum of Light?""

""It is a shrine to Soltris, Goddess of Suns and Stars. It's her who is worshipped primarily here.""

""I have not heard this name before.""

""Have you not? I'm [REDACTED_NAME], her handiwork is present in the sky day and night. who do you worship?""

""Tavig, The platinum Dragon.""

""Ahh... Yes, that makes sense. I've heard of him.""

""Tell me of this 'Soltris.' if you would.""

""Gladly! She is the Goddess of travelers, 'She who guides' the 'Mother of stars,' The light. She Guides all travelers. From the impoverished pilgrim to the wealthy merchant. As I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you know, we are on a road and river that both see traffic to bigger cities. We're a resting place for many caravan trails. As such. Her blessings are felt strongly here.""

""I was unaware Riverstead was so trade-focused actually. Though I suppose that explains the ample caravans my people have traded with.""

""You're from the area, then?""

""Close enough to be worth traveling here for.""

The vagueness of the answer appeared to confuse Sol. ""I see.""

""Do you think the Innkeeper will take a message to deliver to Major when he arrives? I do not wish to disturb her place of business anymore then I have.""

""Ah, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] she will if I ask here, what would you like said to him?""

""Just to tell him where we are, I expect we'll want to go to your home if that offer still stands.""

""It does give me a moment to deliver that to her. And then I'll walk you there.""

Sol stepped back inside the Inn, quickly delivering the message with additional directions to his residence. And not without a small amount of pushing on Beatrice's conscience to ensure she did not forget it when the ogre arrived. Though he was sure, it wasn't entirely needed, as ogres were only minimally less scary then drakon.

From there, it was a short walk to Sol's home. It was a simple wooden home that sat squat. The brothers' heads brushed against the doorframe, and they suspected Major would not be able to fit when he arrived. There was a metal heater in the room on the right. And a table in its center, they could softly hear the sounds of cooking coming from a doorway to the left.

Upon entering, they listened to a feminine voice softly call out. ""Is that you, Sol?""

""Yes, mother, it's me. I brought guests!""

""Oh, friends of yours? Are they staying for dinner?""

""Yes, and the night. The inn won't serve them.""

A middle-aged woman with the tell tale sideburns of Riverstead, though missing the more distinct horns, rounded the corner. ""What? That's terrible- oh my!""

Asgar and Argus waved awkwardly, now attempting to *somehow* become less 'scary', if anything it only resulted in them seeming tense. Which most would have argued made them more frightening.

But Sol's mother seemed unphased. ""Drakon! It's been a long time since I've met your kind. And silver! The ones I met were the most beautiful shade of blue. Do you know them? I expect not, you're an entirely different color. Well, not entirely, silver is a sort of bluish, I suppose. But where are my manners? Sit, sit! I know how much drakon like their meat. Sol!"" She fished out a handful of copper pieces from a pot a put them in his hand. ""Go and fetch some meat from the butcher, spend it all. I can tell just by looking at them that they haven't eaten all day."" Asgar attempted to interrupt the hurricane of words spewing from the woman and raised his hand. ""Ma'am, we don't wish to impose-"" ""None of that now, I haven't even finished talking. It's impolite to refuse a host's generosity as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] you know quite well, young man. And even ruder still to interrupt someone. You'll break their thought process all up, and you'll get them totally lost. Now where was I? Oh right, blue drakon! But you're not blue, Why did I bring them up? I suppose silver is sort of bluish... I said that, didn't I? Sol? Are you still here? Go go go.""

She shooed her son out of the house and turned. ""Right then, how old are you? You're quite tall even for drakon! I think! Maybe I just met a particularly short drakon, I never asked. They still seemed quite tall to me, but then you're even taller. Perhaps the tallest folk I've ever seen. And about the same height too... are you brothers? Twins? Can drakon be twins? I thought they laid eggs, can you get twins from eggs? I always wanted twins, you know. Was hoping for a boy and a girl. Was going to name them Sol and Tris. Tris like Soltris, you see. And Sol like... well Soltris too, I suppose. I've always been very religious, you see, and I felt I should honor Soltris for all she did for me. I was a cleric of hers when I was younger Like Sol is now. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] proud of him! I plan on having him take his pilgrimage soon, you see. I've just about saved up for it. I met his father on mine. Everyone always assumes the pilgrimages are these boring trips down old dirt roads. But that's only if you *are* boring. They can be absolutely delightful. And I must recommend them even if you don't follow Soltris. She watches out for all travelers, no matter their faith. She's great like that. You should try praying to her. I do all the time, and it makes me feel great! But not as good as when I pray on the road. You are travelers, right? I haven't seen you around, so I assume you're not natives. I think I'd remember two shiny folks like yourselves. You are much shinier than the blue ones I met now that I think about it. I can just about see my reflection in you. Is that normal? Do you polish your own scales? What do you use to do that? My, now that I'm [REDACTED_NAME], you are missing quite a few scales, aren't you? What happened? Are you okay? I don't know any healing magic, I'm [REDACTED_NAME]. Still, I can probably clobber old Anverth into making something for you if you're in any pain. Was it bandits? You should always inform the guard about bandits, particularly if you fought them and won. There are bounties, you see. You seem like you won- you're alive after all!""

The brothers stared at her and sniffed the air. They could faintly smell... burning.

""Oh no! my bread! I'll be right back to chat with you dears in just a moment. But I've got to go make sure the food doesn't burn. Toodles!""

The woman ran off into the kitchen, seemingly terribly excited about... well everything really.

Argus spoke. ""She seemed nice.""

Asgar nodded. ""I liked her.""

In a dense forest a beaten and tired orc rested. He had finally killed with the Greataxe. It had taken some time to find a solitary traveler, and he dared not fight a group in the state he was in.

As he lay against a tree, a voice spoke.

However when I was young I would spend nearly every week with her. She was just very sweet and doted on me a lot, which was a stark contrast to my tumultuous home life, so I loved staying with her. 

When I was around maybe like 6-8 I went to her house after going on vacation and she smelled so bad. 
As a child, just being a child, I was honest. She seemed hurt, and took a shower but the smell didn't leave. 
I hate to admit it, but I was so upset as a kid about the smell that I didn't want her to cook for me. The smell was just too much, and I have germaphobic tendencies. In my child mind, the smell would get near my food and I had a meltdown over it. Which was probably really shitty to be on the receiving end of in retrospect.

A few weeks later I was back and the smell was still there. I was relentless. ""It smells like a possum in the road I saw one time"" was the only way child me could explain what it was like to her. 
At some point I think she either began to get worried and decided to go to the dr, or just went for another reason. Thank god(s) she did. 

Turns out she had melanoma. She had a procedure to remove the patches and made a full recovery, and after that, out of curiosity, she asked me if the smell was still there, so I hugged her tight to get a good whiff and it was completely gone. 

A few years later around maybe 10-13 years old, I went to visit her, and the smell was back. I told her, remember when you stunk?"" And she said ""oh no. Do I need to go to the dr again?"" This time she found out she was in one of the earlier stages of breast cancer and eneded up getting a mastectomy. Again making a full recovery. Smell went away. 

3rd time, was melanoma again im pretty sure. But every time she's ever had cancer I've caught it by scent. Im curious if anyone else has ever smelled it. I've  always had a very sensitive nose. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] curious if I only caught it because i know her smell well enough to notice if it changes, like I could  maybe only do it if I know the person's usual scent? 

For those who maybe be wondering, it smells like that sickly sweet, rotting dead animal on a hot day. If you've ever had the displeasure of smelling such a thing. 

Either way. Pretty trippy. I have always been curious about it. No one else in my family smelled what I was smelling.

To really get it, you gotta go back.

Mom always said our dad was a hero. A journalist locked up overseas for speaking out against some messed-up regime. Fighting for truth, freedom of the press, all that.

Laura? hated him. Even with the martyr story, she never forgave him for leaving. She always said: Doesn’t matter how noble the excuse,, gone is still gone.

My brother Michael? Different vibe. He’s quiet. Always thinking, always feeling more than he lets on. He stared at Dad for what felt like forever, like he was trying to figure out if this was real life or a dream. Then just asked: How’d you get out of prison? And… why now?""

Me? I didn’t even know what I felt. It wasn’t hate. Wasn’t joy either. It was like the ground disappeared under my feet. I’d built this whole version of him in my head. This myth. This tragic hero. And standing there was just… a tired old man.

For weeks, he was like a ghost floating around the edges of our lives.

Mom? Not having it. She shut that door on any second chances. SWouldn’t dig up that past she'd already buried.

So guess who took him in?

Aunt freaking Bertha. 

She said the poor guy had nowhere else to go. So, she gave him a dusty little room in the back of her house. He didn’t argue. Just nodded.

And then, one day, his body just… gave up.

The hospital ran a ton of tests. Nothing made sense. His immune system was shutting down but there was no infection, no cancer, like something inside him was rotting...

Aunt Bertha was crushed. Said he wasn’t eating. Barely slept. Claimed it was stress, guilt, all those years of hiding catching up with him. Dad kept saying his mouth felt gross. Headaches that wouldnt quit. Like something was rotting him from the inside.

Then, right before he died, he asked to see us. All of us.Not for love.Not for forgiveness, nope. Just… truth or to drop a bomb and peace out.



He could barely speak, but he was stubborn. Wouldn’t rest till he got it out.

Dad: I was in prison but Not for long, yeah, I was involved in politics. But they let me go after a few months. I didn’t come back because…(he looked at us. All three of us) because I found out you weren’t my biological kids.

Silence. My brain? Cracked

He went on.""Your mom wrote me a letter while I was locked up. Said she loved me. But she’d lied. She told me the truth in that letter.""

""I felt like everything in my life was fake. So I disappeared. I faked my death. Hid.""

He didn’t cry. He just talked. Like he’d been carrying this weight so long and now he was finally allowed to put it down.

And we just… stood there. Statues. Broken. No one said a damn word.

-§-

Edit: Update****
I think it is too long for sharing in a post (just adding another part)

After he died, things got weird. Not at first. 

Aunt Bertha called me two days after the funeral. Said she couldnt stay in the house. Said the room where he slept felt wrong and heavy. She swore she kept hearin something scratching inside the closet at night. But when she checked, nothing. Just dust and his old suitcase, still zipped up, still sitting where he left it

That thing freaked me out. Idk why. It was just a damn suitcase. But every time I looked at it, I felt like it was looking back. 

Michael opened it. That’s his thing. So he did.

There wasnt much inside. A couple of shirts, a half-used bar of soap wrapped in paper (ew), some faded photos of people we didnt recognize. And this notebook. Leather-bound. No title. Just stuffed with pages of cramped handwriting.

We took it home. Dumb idea.

The first few pages were what you'd expect. Random notes. Political crap. Names. Numbers. But then the tone shifted. Got paranoid. Obsessive. He started writing like someone was watching him. Following him. There were pages scratched out so hard the paper tore.

There was an another note, dated just a few days before he died. One of the last things he wrote:

'That night I couldnt sleep. My mouth tasted weird. Bitter. Metallic. Like I’d been chewing on aluminum foil""

Laura wanted to burn it. Straight up tossed it in the sink and lit a match. But the damn thing wouldn’t catch. It blackened around the edges but never really burned. 

The next day I went to see Mom. She looked worse than I’ve ever seen her. Like she’d aged ten years in a week.

She didnt even say hi, just stared out the window

Eventually, I got the nerve to ask her about the letter, okay, the one she sent Dad when he was in prison. The one that made him disappear.I told her I wanted the Truth. About everything and about him and about us. 

About who our father really was

Or if he was even the only one

She didnt speak. Just turned her head slowly and gave me this look cold and scared at the same time. Like she wanted to tell me, but her mouth wouldnt let her.And then she said: What the hell are you talking about? Are you high again?

And She walked away.

That night, Laura called hysterical. Said she found Michael in the bathtub. Not dead. Not bleeding. Just sitting there, fully clothed, muttering to himself...over and over:

“He wasn’t supposed to come back. He wasn’t supposed to come back”

We checked him into a clinic the next day. He hasn’t said a word since.

Now it’s just me. Me and this notebook I cannot seem to throw away. 

Well, Sometimes I think I see him. My dad. In reflections. In places he shouldn be.

Like he never left.

Like he’s still watching us

So, I went to Aunt Bertha’s place to ask her about it all. I needed answers. She let me in but there was something… off about her. Her eyes were too wide, like she hadn slept; her hands shook when she poured me a drink. She kept glancing over her shoulder, as someone might walk in.

I asked her about the suitcase. She didn answer right away. Then after a long silence, she finally spoke so soft I almost didn hear it:

“I loved him”

WHAT??

This happened a few years back. I was doing long-haul, mostly cross-country routes, the kind that take you through vast stretches of nothing. You know the ones – where the radio turns to static for hours, and the only sign of life is the occasional pair of headlights going the other way, miles apart. I was young, eager for the miles, the money. Didn’t mind the solitude. Or so I thought.

The route I was on took me across a long, desolate stretch of highway that ran between the borders of two large governmental territories. I don’t want to say exactly where, but think big, empty spaces, lots of trees, not much else. It was notorious among drivers for being a dead zone – no signal, no towns for a hundred miles either side, and prone to weird weather. Most guys tried to hit it during daylight, but schedules are schedules. Mine had me crossing it deep in the night.

I remember the feeling. Utter blackness outside the sweep of my headlights. The kind of dark that feels like it’s pressing in on the cab. The only sounds were the drone of the diesel engine, the hiss of the air brakes now and then, and the rhythmic thrum of the tires on asphalt. Hypnotic. Too hypnotic.

I’d been driving for about ten hours, with a short break a few states back. Coffee was wearing off. The dashboard lights were a dull green glow, comforting in a way, but also making the darkness outside seem even more absolute. My eyelids felt like they had lead weights attached. You fight it, you know? Slap your face, roll down the window for a blast of cold air, crank up whatever music you can find that hasn’t dissolved into static. I was doing all of that.

It must have been around 2 or 3 AM. I was in that weird state where you’re not quite asleep, but not fully awake either. Like your brain is running on low power mode. The white lines on the road were starting to blur together, stretching and warping. Standard fatigue stuff. I remember blinking hard, trying to refocus.

That’s when I saw it. Or thought I saw it.

Just a flicker at the edge of my headlights, on the right shoulder of the road. Small. Low to the ground. For a split second, I registered a shape, vaguely human-like, and then it was gone, swallowed by the darkness as I passed.

My first thought? Deer. Or a coyote. Common enough. But it hadn't moved like an animal. It had been upright. My brain, sluggish as it was, tried to process it. Too small for an adult. Too still for an animal startled by a rig.

Then the logical part, the part that was still trying to keep me safe on the road, chimed in: You’re tired. Seeing things. Happens.

And I almost accepted that. I really did. Shook my head, took a swig of lukewarm water from the bottle beside me. Kept my eyes glued to the road ahead. The image, though, it kind of stuck. A small, upright shape. Like a child.

No way, I told myself. Out here? Middle of nowhere? Middle of the night? Impossible. Kids don’t just wander around on inter-territorial highways at 3 AM. It had to be a trick of the light, a bush, my eyes playing games. I’ve seen weirder things born of exhaustion. Shadows that dance, trees that look like figures. It’s part of the job when you’re pushing limits.

I drove on for maybe another thirty seconds, the image fading, my rational mind starting to win. Just a figment.
Then, I glanced at my passenger-side mirror. Habit. Always checking.

And my blood went cold. Not just cold, it felt like it turned to slush.

There, illuminated faintly by the red glow of my trailer lights receding into the distance, was the reflection of a small figure. Standing. On the shoulder of the road. Exactly where I’d thought I’d seen something.

It wasn’t a bush. It wasn’t a shadow. It was small, and it was definitely standing there, unmoving, as my truck pulled further and further away.

My heart started hammering against my ribs. This wasn’t fatigue. This was real. There was someone, something, back there. And it looked tiny.

Every instinct screamed at me. Danger. Wrong. Keep going. But another voice, the one that makes us human, I suppose, whispered something else. A kid? Alone out here? What if they’re hurt? Lost?

I fought with myself for a few seconds that stretched into an eternity. The image in the mirror was getting smaller, fainter. If I didn’t act now, they’d be lost to the darkness again. God, the thought of leaving a child out there, if that’s what it was…

Against my better judgment, against that primal urge to just floor it, I made a decision. I slowed the rig, the air brakes hissing like angry snakes. Pulled over to the shoulder, the truck groaning in protest. Put on my hazards, their rhythmic flashing cutting into the oppressive blackness.

Then, I did what you’re never supposed to do with a full trailer on a narrow shoulder. I started to reverse. Slowly. Carefully. My eyes flicking between the mirrors, trying to keep the trailer straight, trying to relocate that tiny figure. The crunch of gravel under the tires sounded unnaturally loud.

It took a minute, maybe two, but it felt like an hour. The red glow of my tail lights eventually washed over the spot again. And there it was.

A kid.

I stopped the truck so my cab was roughly alongside them, maybe ten feet away. Switched on the high beams, hoping to get a better look, and also to make myself clearly visible as just a truck, not something else.

The kid was… small. Really small. I’d guess maybe six, seven years old? Hard to tell in the glare. They were just standing there, on the very edge of the gravel shoulder, right where the trees began. The woods pressed in close on this stretch of road, tall, dark pines and dense undergrowth that looked like a solid black wall just beyond the reach of my lights.

The kid wasn’t looking at me. They were facing sort of parallel to the road, just… walking. Slowly. Like they were on a stroll, completely oblivious to the massive eighteen-wheeler that had just pulled up beside them, engine rumbling, lights blazing. They were wearing what looked like pajamas. Thin, light-colored pajamas. In the chill of the night. No coat, no shoes that I could see.

My mind reeled. This was wrong. So many levels of wrong.

I killed the engine. The sudden silence was almost deafening, amplifying the crickets, the rustle of leaves in the woods from a breeze I couldn’t feel in the cab. My heart was still thumping, a weird mix of fear and adrenaline and a dawning sense of responsibility.

I rolled down the  window. The night air hit me, cold and damp, carrying the scent of pine and wet earth.

“Hey!” I called out. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud in the quiet. “Hey, kid!”

No response. They just kept walking, one small, bare foot in front of the other, at a pace that was taking them absolutely nowhere fast. Their head was down, slightly. I couldn’t see their face properly.

“Kid! Are you okay?” I tried again, louder this time.

Slowly, so slowly, the kid stopped. They didn’t turn their head fully, just sort of angled it a fraction, enough that I could see a pale sliver of cheek in the spill of my headlights. Still not looking at me. Still ignoring the multi-ton machine idling beside them.

A prickle of unease ran down my spine. Not the normal kind of unease. This was deeper, colder. Animals act weird sometimes, but kids? A lost kid should be scared, relieved, something. This one was… nothing.

“What are you doing out here all alone?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm, friendly. Like you’re supposed to with a scared kid. Even though this one didn’t seem scared at all. “It’s the middle of the night.”

Silence. Just the sound of their bare feet scuffing softly on the gravel as they took another step, then another. As if my presence was a minor inconvenience, a background noise they were choosing to ignore.

This wasn’t right. My internal alarm bells were clanging louder now. My hand hovered near the gearstick. Part of me wanted to slam it into drive and get the hell out of there. But the image of this tiny child, alone, possibly in shock… I couldn’t just leave. Could I?

“Where are your parents?” I pushed, my voice a bit sharper than I intended. “Are you lost?”

Finally, the kid stopped walking completely. They turned their head, just a little more. Still not looking directly at my cab, more towards the front of my truck, into the glare of the headlights. I could see their face a bit better now. Pale. Featureless in the harsh light, like a porcelain doll. Small, dark smudges that might have been eyes. No expression. None. Not fear, not sadness, not relief. Just… blank. An unreadable slate.

Then, a voice. Small. Thin. Like the rustle of dry leaves.
“Lost.”

Just that one word. It hung in the air between us.

Relief washed over me, quickly followed by a fresh wave of concern. Okay, lost. That’s something I can deal with. “Okay, kid. Lost is okay. We can fix lost. Where do you live? Where were you going?”

The kid finally, slowly, turned their head fully towards my cab. Towards me.
I still couldn’t make out much detail in their face. The angle, the light, something was obscuring it, keeping it in a sort of shadowy vagueness despite the headlights. But I could feel their gaze. It wasn't like a normal kid's look. There was a weight to it, an intensity that was deeply unsettling for such a small form.

“Home,” the kid said, that same thin, reedy voice. “Trying to get home.”

“Right, home. Where is home?” I asked, leaning forward a bit, trying to project reassurance. “Is it near here? Did you wander off from a campsite? A car?” There were no campsites for miles. No broken-down cars on the shoulder. I knew that.

The kid didn’t answer that question directly. Instead, they took a small step towards the truck. Then another. My hand tensed on the door handle, ready to open it, to offer… what? A ride? Shelter? I didn’t know.

“It’s cold out here,” I said, stating the obvious. “You should get in. We can get you warm, and I can call for help when we get to a spot with a signal.” My CB was useless, just static. My phone had shown ‘No Service’ for the last hour.

The kid stopped about five feet from my passenger door. Still in that pale, thin pajama-like outfit. Barefoot on the sharp gravel. They should be shivering, crying. They were doing neither.

“Can you help me?” the kid asked. The voice was still small, but there was a different inflection to it now. Less flat. A hint of… something else. Pleading, maybe?

“Yeah, of course, I can help you,” I said. “That’s why I stopped. Where are your parents? How did you get here?”

The kid tilted their head. A jerky, unnatural little movement. “They’re waiting. At home.”

“Okay… And where’s home? Which direction?” I gestured vaguely up and down the empty highway.

The kid didn’t point down the road. They made a small, subtle gesture with their head, a little nod, towards the trees. Towards the impenetrable darkness of the woods lining the highway.

“In there,” the kid said.

My stomach clenched. “In the woods? Your home is in the woods?”

“Lost,” the kid repeated, as if that explained everything. “Trying to find the path. It’s dark.”

“Yeah, it’s… it’s very dark,” I agreed, my eyes scanning the treeline. It looked like a solid wall of black. No sign of any path, any habitation. Just dense, old-growth forest. The kind of place you could get lost in for days, even in daylight.

“Can you… come out?” the kid asked. “Help me look? It’s not far. I just… I can’t see it from here.”

Every rational thought in my head screamed NO. Get out of the truck? In the middle of nowhere, in the pitch dark, with this… strange child, who wanted me to go into those woods? No. Absolutely not.

But the kid looked so small. So vulnerable. If there was even a tiny chance they were telling the truth, that their house was just a little way in, and they were genuinely lost…

“I… I don’t think that’s a good idea, buddy,” I said, trying to sound gentle. “It’s dangerous in there at night. For both of us. Best thing is for you to hop in here with me. We’ll drive until we get a signal, and then we’ll call the police, or the rangers. They can help find your home properly.”

The kid just stood there. That blank, unreadable face fixed on me.
“But it’s right there,” they insisted, their voice a little more insistent now. “Just a little way. I can almost see it. If you just… step out… the light from your door would help.”

My skin was crawling. There was something profoundly wrong with this scenario. The way they were trying to coax me out. The lack of normal emotional response. The pajamas. The bare feet. The woods.

I looked closer at the kid, trying to pierce that strange vagueness around their features. My headlights were bright, but it was like they absorbed the light rather than reflected it. Their eyes… I still couldn’t really see their eyes. Just dark hollows.

“I really think you should get in the truck,” I said, my voice firmer now. “It’s warmer in here. We can figure it out together.”

The kid took another step closer. They were almost at my running board now.
“Please?” they said. That reedy voice again. “My leg hurts. I can’t walk much further. If you could just… help me a little. Just to the path.”

My internal conflict was raging. My trucker instincts, honed by years of seeing weird stuff and hearing weirder stories at truck stops, were blaring warnings. But the human part, the part that saw a child in distress, was still there, still arguing.

I was tired. So damn tired. Maybe I wasn’t thinking straight. Maybe this was all some bizarre misunderstanding.

I squinted, trying to see past the kid, towards the treeline they’d indicated. Was there a faint trail I was missing? A flicker of light deep in the woods? No. Nothing. Just blackness. Solid, unyielding blackness.

And then I saw it.
It wasn’t something I saw clearly at first. It was more like… an anomaly. A disturbance in the darkness behind the kid.

The kid was standing with their back mostly to the woods, facing my truck. Behind them, the darkness of the forest was absolute. Or it should have been. But there was something… connected to them. Something that stretched from the small of their back, from under the thin pajama top, and disappeared into the deeper shadows of the trees.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, a weird shadow cast by my headlights hitting them at an odd angle. Maybe a rope they were dragging? A piece of clothing snagged on a branch?

I leaned forward, trying to get a clearer view. The kid was still talking, their voice a low, persistent murmur. “It’s not far… please… just help me… I’m so cold…”

But I wasn’t really listening to the words anymore. I was focused on that… that thing behind them.

It wasn’t a rope. It wasn’t a shadow.
It was… a tube. A long, dark, thick tube.
It seemed to emerge directly from the kid’s lower back, impossibly, seamlessly. It was dark matte, like a strip of the night itself given form, and it snaked away from the child, maybe ten, fifteen feet, before disappearing into the inky blackness between two thick pine trunks. It wasn’t rigid; it seemed to have a slight, almost imperceptible flexibility, like a massive, sluggish umbilical cord made of shadow. It didn’t reflect any light from my headlamps. It just… absorbed it.

My breath hitched in my throat. My blood, which had been cold before, now felt like it had frozen solid. This wasn’t just wrong. This was… impossible. Unnatural.

The kid was still trying to coax me. “Are you going to help me? It’s just there. You’re so close.”

My voice, when I finally found it, was barely a whisper. I couldn’t take my eyes off that… appendage.
“Kid… what… what is that? Behind you?”

The kid flinched. Not a big movement, just a tiny, almost imperceptible tightening of their small frame. Their head, which had been tilted pleadingly, straightened. The blankness on their face seemed to… solidify.

“What’s what?” they asked, their voice suddenly devoid of that pleading tone. It was flat again. Colder.

“That… that thing,” I stammered, pointing with a shaking finger. “Coming out of your back. Going into the woods. What is that?”

The kid didn’t turn to look. They didn’t need to. Their gaze, those dark, unseen eyes, bored into me.
“It’s nothing,” they said. The voice was still small, but it had a new edge to it. A hardness. “You’re seeing things. You’re tired.”

They were using my own earlier rationalization against me.

“No,” I said, my voice gaining a tremor of conviction born of sheer terror. “No, I’m not. I see it. It’s right there. It’s… it’s connected to you.”

The kid was silent for a long moment. The only sound was the thumping of my own heart, so loud I was sure they could hear it. The crickets had stopped. The wind seemed to die down. An unnatural stillness fell over the scene.

Then, the kid’s face began to change.
It wasn’t a dramatic, movie-monster transformation. It was far more subtle, and far more terrifying. The blankness didn’t leave, but it… sharpened. The pale skin seemed to tighten over the bones. The areas where the eyes were, those dark smudges, seemed to deepen, to become more shadowed, more intense. And a flicker of something ancient and utterly alien passed across their features. It wasn't human anger. It was something older, colder, and infinitely more patient, now strained to its limit.

The air in my cab suddenly felt thick, heavy, hard to breathe.

“Just come out of the truck,” the kid said, and the voice… oh god, the voice.
It wasn’t the small, reedy voice of a child anymore. It was deeper. Resonant. With a strange, grating undertone, like stones grinding together. It was coming from that small frame, but it was impossibly large, impossibly old. It vibrated in my chest.

“Come out. Now.” The command was absolute.

My hand, which had been hovering near the gearstick, now gripped it like a lifeline. My other hand fumbled for the ignition key, which I’d stupidly left in.

“What are you?” I choked out, staring at the monstrous thing playing dress-up in a child’s form, at the dark, pulsating tube that was its anchor to the shadows.

The kid’s head tilted again, that jerky, unnatural movement. The expression on its face – if you could call it that – was one of pure, unadulterated annoyance. Contempt. Like I was a particularly stupid insect it had failed to swat.

And then it spoke, in that same terrible, resonant, grinding voice. The words it said are burned into my memory, colder than any winter night.

“Why,” it rasped, the sound seeming to scrape the inside of my skull, “the FUCK are humans smarter now?”

That was it.
That one sentence. The sheer, cosmic frustration in it. The implication of past encounters, of easier prey. The utter alien nature of it.

I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I reacted.
Primal fear, the kind that bypasses all higher brain function, took over.
My hand twisted the key. The diesel engine roared back to life, a sudden, violent explosion of sound in the horrifying stillness.
The kid, the thing, actually recoiled. A small, jerky step back. The expression – that awful, tightened, ancient look – intensified.

I slammed the gearstick into drive. My foot stomped on the accelerator. The truck lurched forward, tires spinning on the gravel for a terrifying second before they bit into the asphalt.
I didn’t look at it. I couldn’t. I stared straight ahead, my knuckles white on the steering wheel, the whole cab vibrating around me.

The truck surged forward, gaining speed with agonizing slowness. For a horrible moment, I imagined that tube-thing whipping out, trying to snag the trailer, to pull me back, to drag me into those woods. I imagined that small figure, with its ancient, terrible voice, somehow keeping pace.

I risked a glance in my driver-side mirror.
It was standing there. On the shoulder. Unmoving.
The headlights of my departing truck cast its small silhouette into sharp relief. And behind it, the dark tube was still visible, a thick, obscene cord snaking back into the endless night of the forest. It didn't seem to be retracting or moving. It just was.

The thing didn’t pursue. It just stood and watched me go.
And that, somehow, was almost worse. The sheer confidence. The patience. Like it knew there would be others. Or maybe it was just annoyed that this particular attempt had failed.

I drove.
I don’t know for how long. I just drove. My foot was welded to the floor. The engine screamed. I watched the speedometer needle climb, far past any legal or safe limit for a rig that size, on a road that dark. I didn’t care.
The image of that thing, that child-shape with its dark umbilical to the woods, and that voice, that awful, grinding voice asking its horrifying question, was burned onto the inside of my eyelids.

I must have driven for an hour, maybe more, at speeds that should have gotten me killed or arrested, before the adrenaline started to fade, replaced by a bone-deep, shaking exhaustion that was more profound than any fatigue I’d ever known.
My hands were trembling so violently I could barely keep the wheel straight. Tears were streaming down my face – not from sadness, but from sheer, unadulterated terror and relief.

When the first hint of dawn started to grey the eastern sky, and my phone finally beeped, indicating a single bar of service, I pulled over at the first wide spot I could find. I practically fell out of the cab, vomiting onto the gravel until there was nothing left but dry heaves.
I sat there on the cold ground, shaking, for a long time, watching the sun come up, trying to convince myself that it had been a dream, a hallucination brought on by exhaustion.

But I knew it wasn’t. The detail of that tube. The voice. The question. You don’t hallucinate something that specific, that coherent, that utterly alien.

I never reported it. Who would I report it to? What would I say? ""Officer, I saw a little kid who was actually an ancient cosmic horror tethered to the woods by a nightmare umbilical cord, and it got mad because I didn't want to be its dinner?"" They’d have locked me up. Breathalyzed me, drug tested me, sent me for a psych eval.

I finished that run on autopilot. Dropped the load. Drove my rig back to the yard. And I quit.
I told them I was burned out, needed a break. They tried to convince me to stay, offered me different routes, more pay. I just couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that kid, that tube, those woods. Every dark road felt like a trap.

I found a local job, something that keeps me home at night. I don’t drive in remote areas anymore if I can help it. Especially not at night. I still have nightmares. Sometimes, when I’m very tired, driving home late from somewhere, I’ll see a flicker at the edge of my vision, on the side of the road, and my heart will try to beat its way out of my chest.

I don’t know what that thing was. An alien? A demon? Something else, something that doesn’t fit into our neat little categories? All I know is that it’s out there. And it’s patient. And it seems to have learned that its old tricks aren't as effective as they used to be.

""Why the fuck are humans smarter now?""

That question haunts me. It implies they weren’t always. It implies that, once upon a time, we were easier. That maybe, just maybe, people like me, tired and alone on dark roads, used to just step out of the cab when asked.
And were never seen again.

So, if you’re ever driving one of those long, lonely stretches of road, deep in the night, and you see something you can’t explain… Maybe just keep driving. Maybe being “smarter now” means knowing when not to stop. Knowing when to ignore that little voice telling you to help, because what’s asking for help might not be what it seems.

Stay safe out there. And for God’s sake, stay on the well-lit roads.",5614

Anywho I only had an hour before the gym closed and before he started yapping I said “Hey I only have an hour I’m gonna just do my set” basically telling him to politely back off. He full on ignored me and kept on yapping, inching closer and closer. By this point the girl behind him was mouthing if I was okay and I felt so uncomfortable. He was literally kneeling inches away from me and I felt trapped. I told him multiple times to go, and I even had my headphones on doing hip thrusts and he was still talking. After my set I got up and walked to the water fountain, I was so frustrated I almost cried. I set boundaries and he just didn’t listen to me. The girl from before checked on me and she was genuinely so sweet. Here’s to say I’m never going to the gym without my brother again.",2653
1dsqy11,1719834290.0,2024-07-01 11:44:50,stories,My husband is a human gas chamber.,"So, about 3 weeks ago I flew to South Korea for a vacation with friends who live there. My husband didn't want to go and said he'd be fine staying home and watching the house and dog. I trusted him because he's a 40 year old adult man and assumed he'd be able to feed himself like a sane person despite him possessing the cooking ability of a cactus. I was wrong. I should've dragged him and the dog along with me to another country.

What my husband decided to do during his 3 weeks without me was absurd. I would've been happier if he'd cheated on me instead. Because what he did was: order nothing but Taco Bell through DoorDash after he: somehow broke my stove by: cooking an entire 15lbs bag of red lentils all at once. Then he didn't bother to get a bowl for his lentils, he just ate them straight from the pot and stuffed the pot into the fridge and broke one of the shelves inside it. Now realizing his mistake, he decided to order nothing but terrible tacos for the remaining 2 weeks while getting high on medical marijuana. Also for some reason he bought a bunch of honeycombs from one of our friend's fathers and decided those made a good snack and has eaten nothing but beeswax and honey for the last few days because he's some kind of weird alien in a human disguise. Apparently honeycombs give you gas. And lentils give you gas. And *Taco Bell* gives you gas.

So now it's today and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] by what sounds like someone revving a motorcycle in my bedroom followed by the stench of the fiery pits of hell itself. It's 5:30 in the morning. He gets up and goes to use the toilet as I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the windows in a poor attempt to ventilate the house but it's too late. He doesn't even have a solid poop, it's just 10 minutes of gas. Like 20 seconds of nonstop farts followed by a huge gasp of air and then another 20 seconds of gas. By this time, the dog has hidden under my couch because it doesn't know what those loud honking noises are and fears for its safety. I consider joining it, but continue to open every window in my house. It's 62 degrees out and windy. The wind just blows the fart smell around the house. My husband has left the bathroom and has walked upstairs. It sounds like there's a small 2-stroke engine in his pants. 

I can't take it anymore and scream that I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to get breakfast at the diner and leave him. I bring the dog with me because the dog follows me out of the house because it also doesn't want to be here right now. So now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the diner waiting for my husband to de-gas himself while the dog sits underneath the table next to me wearing a pink leash-kid harness that my friends bought for *me* as a gag gift that has *my* name and ""Emotional Support Human"" on it that the waitress thought was some kind of in-joke. 

This is the start of my morning. I hope it's not as stinky as yours.",17521
1k8ku5z,1745695092.0,2025-04-26 19:18:12,stories,The Day I Found Out My Dog Had a Secret Life....,"So about two years ago, I adopted this golden retriever named Milo. Sweetest dog ever. Loves everyone. Typical golden energy — tail wagging so hard it could knock over a lamp.  

We live in a quiet neighborhood where a lot of people leave their gates open, and Milo has always been good about staying close to home. I trusted him enough to let him hang out in the front yard sometimes while I worked inside with the window open.  

One afternoon, I realized it had been a little \*too\* quiet for a while. I went outside to call him, and he wasn’t there. Full panic mode activated. I grabbed his leash and started running up and down the street yelling his name like a crazy person.  

About three houses down, I saw something that made me stop dead in my tracks. ​ 
Milo...was sitting on someone else’s porch..... 

nd not just sitting. He was lounging like he \*\*owned\*\* the place. Head up, tongue out, happy as could be. And next to him? An older woman in a rocking chair, feeding him \*pieces of chicken\* from a plate.  

I was like, “Uh...Milo??”  

The woman looked up and smiled and said,  
“Oh, you must be Milo’s other family!”  

Other family??

Turns out, for MONTHS, Milo had been slipping away whenever I wasn’t looking and visiting this woman, Mrs. Patterson. She lived alone, her kids were grown, and apparently, Milo had just decided to adopt her. He’d show up every couple of days, sit politely on her porch, and she’d reward him with chicken, scraps, and the occasional bacon strip.  

We both laughed about it, and I apologized like a thousand times for him intruding, but she waved it off and said he was “good company.”  

After that, we kind of made it official — Milo had two homes. I started bringing Mrs. Patterson groceries once a week, and Milo got to have his second grandma.  

He still splits his time between us, and honestly? I think he had the right idea.

1jn1h3w,1743297609.0,2025-03-30 01:20:09,stories,A Mormon friend got in trouble for having a disgusting picture on his phone...,"I went to Air Force basic training like 6 years ago. They took away our phones on day one, and we didn't get them back until 10 weeks later. I remember when I finally got to look at it after so long, it was like the brightest, most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life.

At technical school, we were living in a dorm-like building, and there was a Whatsapp group chat the ""airman leaders"" made for everyone in the building. Its intended purpose was to dole out the chores and cleaning responsibilities.

...but that group chat rapidly turned into a waste land for the weirdest, most depraved memes you've ever seen. These 18-year-old kids who just got all their phones back had *absolutely no chill.* My phone was pinging at all hours of the day and night as a torrent of weird memes poured into the group chat.

The airman leaders kept posting that memes were not allowed in the group chat, but the 18-year-old masses were unstoppable. They were equipped with a seemingly endless arsenal of fucked-up memes.

One day somebody posted a meme that was a four-panel comic of a thicc Winnie-the-Pooh. He was wearing a thong and a bra, and he had a jar of honey stuck on his head. He was bumbling around, knocking everything in his house over with his thicc ass and his huge, juicy tits as he tried to get the jar of honey off his head.

Well, that turned out to be the straw that broke the camel's back. The mods of the Whatsapp group chat changed the settings so that only they could post messages.

But after that, they only posted about the chores once a week, and they didn't delete any of the memes, so that thicc Winnie-the-Pooh meme was still visible on the group chat for weeks. 

My Mormon friend Terry went to dinner with his wife, and she happened to see the thicc Winnie-the-Pooh meme on his phone. She was inconsolable; she could not understand why her devout, religious husband would have such a disgusting thing on his phone.

It actually turned into a big deal in their marriage. One day he brought her to morning formation so he could prove to her that the thicc Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't just on his phone. Me and a bunch of other airmen pulled out our phones and opened the Whatsapp group chat to show her that the meme was on our phones too.

I'll never forget the unfathomable look on that poor little Mormon girl's face as her eyes darted frantically from one thicc Winnie-the-Pooh to the next in the early morning light...",4726
17pmtd3,1699333117.0,2023-11-07 04:58:37,stories,I met an older man when I was young,"When I was in my teens I went on a chat app to talk to people. I was super lonely as I was bullied severely and had an insecure home. My family kept trying to kick me out of the house so I was very worried about where I would go if they eve decided to make it permanent. Being a teen I didn't have the best judgement and ended up talking to old guys who would message me. One guy was from close by and was very set on meeting. I was so set on having a possible alternative that I met up with the guy.

I met him in a Starbucks. He was very handsy and aggressive. I stuck through it though as he had money and was paying for everything regarding our meet. He wanted to take a walk in a less dense area. I was scared to go away from the crowd but I went anyway. He grabbed me and kissed me and told me that we should go to his car. Once at his car he tried to coax me to get in.

I didn't get in his car and told him I had to go. He tried a couple more times then sighed and asked if he could walk me. I said no as I didn't want him to know what I drove. I made sure he didn't follow me.

I’ve never told anyone this as I am [REDACTED_NAME] that I went out to meet this guy. I don't think many people would understand my reasoning, I know it was a bad choice. I felt trapped and desperate at the time. Families should never make their kids feel insecure about home, I wouldn’t have went if I wasn’t threatened with homelessness.

Edit: to anyone saying it was my fault because they assumed I was a problem child or using the guy for money, those are not helpful or valid statements. I was an honor roll student in high school, my family was hooked on substances while being mentally ill, they still aren’t clean. This man knew how old I was and still wanted to meet me a touch me, I’ll just make that clear. ",351

I started screaming, my husband and I both fly out of bed and turned the lights on. I can barely talk I’m still screaming. We are ripping off the blankets, looking on the sides of the bed, doing the most to find that mf.

Now their messy relationship is spilling into the family, and everyone’s choosing sides.","I (27F) have a complicated family dynamic, to say the least. My ex-boyfriend Alex (30M) and I dated for three years, and during that time, he became really close with my family. He was charming, helpful, and honestly, my parents liked him more than I did toward the end of the relationship. We broke up amicably (or so I thought), but it still stung when, less than a year later, my brother Matt (32M) announced that he and Alex were dating.

At first, I tried to be supportive. Love is love, and it wasn’t like I wanted Alex back. But the dynamic became unbearable when they got married and Alex essentially inserted himself into every family situation. He has this knack for twisting conversations into awkward reminders of our past relationship. At family dinners, he’ll make comments like, “Oh, remember when we used to eat at this place all the time?” while my brother sits there awkwardly.

Fast forward to now: their relationship is a total trainwreck. They fight constantly and drag my parents into it. My mom confided in me that Alex has been pressuring Matt to buy a house he doesn’t want, and now Matt’s credit is tanked. On top of that, Alex’s behavior at family gatherings has been unbearable. He got drunk at my niece’s birthday party last week and made a toast where he “joked” about how he dated me first and married up.

I tried to stay neutral for years, but this is getting out of hand. My brother is visibly miserable, but every time I bring it up, he accuses me of trying to sabotage his marriage out of jealousy. Meanwhile, my parents are exhausted by the drama but refuse to set boundaries because they’re afraid of losing Matt and their future grandchildren.

I’m torn between letting this dumpster fire burn itself out and stepping in to tell my brother he deserves better. Has anyone else dealt with a situation where a family member married your ex? How do I handle this without completely tearing the family apart?",2939

Despite the unfortunate situation, the COO said I was a great fit for the position and offered me a job with a three times higher salary than my previous one, along with excellent benefits.

1h64tb9,1733277530.0,2024-12-04 01:58:50,stories,"A little boy came up to me at a playground and told me ""He's not my dad""","I remember this so vividly; it was so scary. I was a nanny a few years ago for 3 little girls (1, 4 and 6 years old). After school, we went to the playground up the hill.  There were a few parents and little children there. I kept an eye on the elder girls as I was with the baby on the baby swing.

Parents and their kids left until a boy around 3 was left playing with the girls under my care. I noticed his dad sitting on the picnic chair on his phone, I was a bit peeved that I seemed to now be watching over 4 kids not 3. The boy then slowly came over to me and kind of clung himself to me. I thought he was coming for a cuddle, so I said aww and put an arm around him asking if he was alright. He looked a bit sad. He then said, ""He's not my dad"". I skeptically looked at the man then asked, ""Who is he?"" (uncle? stepdad?) and the boy looked me dead in the eyes and said, ""I don't know"". My heart dropped.

I went into protective mode and my instincts made me put the boy behind me. I looked back at the man who was now approaching us. My heart was beating so hard. I told the girls we were leaving right now and grabbed the baby. The girls complained but headed for their bikes behind the man. I looked around, but no one else was there. I only saw some people walking along the street at the bottom of the hill, so I could shout to them if needed. I warned him to stay back and held onto the boy. He asked what I was doing, looking at my grip on the boy. I was panicking and backing away. he told me to let go of him. I told him what the boy said and that if he touches him or I, I will scream, looking toward the people so that he knew we weren't technically alone. He kind of laughed nervously and addressed the boy who didn't even look at him or move. I told him to leave us alone. He just stared at me in shock with his hands up, like I was the dangerous one?!

I said I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the police, letting go of the boy, and got my phone out (the baby still in my arms). He panicked and said that he was his stepdad, or 'soon to be' stepdad. I said yeah right. He explained that he was dating his mother, and she was still at work, so he got him from school and brought him here until she gets home. I didn't believe him, so I started dialing, better to have them deal with this (and be safe not sorry). As I spoke (shaking like crazy) I beckoned the boy to stay by me and away from the man. The boy was silently crying (poor little guy was terrified). The man was exasperated and bright red which made me more nervous cause what if he hurts me or the kids? My girls were watching on their bikes and asking me what's going on. 

The worst part was waiting for the police. He was between me and the girls, and I was between him and a fence. The police came pretty quickly though, and I explained everything, and the man tried to explain himself. The police were also skeptical of him (thank God I wasn't just overreacting). I told the boy how good he was coming to me for help and the policewoman took the boy. The man called his ""girlfriend"" (the boy's mother) to get her to come. I didn't want to just leave; I felt responsible since the boy came to me for help and comfort. So, I let the girls continue playing on the playground while we waited for the mother who came straight away. 

When she arrived, the boy ran straight to her crying. The police explained, I explained, and the mother was so embarrassed. I pretty much told her off (and the man of course) for scaring me, my girls and the boy. The boy hardly knows the man (hardly recognizes who he is and doesn't understand what he is to him) and was clearly not comfortable with him. He is too young to get the concept of 'mom's boyfriend, not dad' and when you're that young, remembering people whom you have only met a few times is hard. She was so sorry. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] he wasn't that trusting because a lot of kids get caught out trusting strangers or acquaintances. Also hard to navigate their parent's dating. 

I finally left with the girls (I had a diaper to change). Felt bad for the man eventually as he was just trying to help his girlfriend out and bond with the kid. And the mom probably thought it would be a good way for him to get to know her son, one on one. But they didn't think about the boy's feelings and how outsiders would perceive. I am [REDACTED_NAME] from it though. Thought he was a pedo adducting him and that he was going to hurt me and/or the children. ",2855
1e3eehc,1720995067.0,2024-07-14 22:11:07,stories,I’m divorcing my husband because of his farts & also everyone thinks I’m the honeycomb wife ,"
TLDR: I’m divorcing my husband because of his farts. But for the love, please read the whole thing before you comment. Fr. 

I truly wish this were a joke. Part of this whole situation is on me for not dating him for a long time before we got married, and a big chunk of that dating was spent having completely lost my sense of smell from Covid. That fact alone is absolutely unbelievable but it’s true. Side note, I got my smell back. The other wild part is that when we were dating, he hung over at my place mainly, and I didn’t carry a lot of unhealthy snacks for him to snack on at night. This fact is VERY relevant for the story.

Once we got married, things went downhill very quickly. He started inhailing as many snacks and as much dairy as possible at night. Sometimes he would go out and get a deep dish, fried cheese, loaded pizza and devour it at 11 PM after eating an entire bag of greasy chips and like 27 pieces of taffy. And a glass of milk. Or 3. 

At first I thought it was just a bad fart here and there. But as the nights progressed, I realized that the bad farts were becoming a nightly nightmare. 

I know what normal stinky farts are. Even bad sulfuric farts. But, these are not simply either of those. These farts are incompatible with life itself. 

The first time one really hit me in the face, I projectile vomited. I could taste them. They were are almost tangible objects in the air. I’m convinced they are soaked into the carpet and walls. Rotten egg is not even enough to describe what the smell is. It’s almost as if something literally died inside of his stomach and was leaking into the air trying to kill anyone that smells it. 

His farts are not human. They are not silly little rotten egg farts. There is something wrong with him. Truly. These farts are almost alive with a mind of their own, and they are terrifying. If there was a horror movie made about farts, it would be about his.

They are unsettling at best. They make your mind feel like something bad happened, perhaps a murder. Your spirit does not feel settled because these are not normal farts in anyway at all. These are violently horrifying.

It got to the point where I had to stop sleeping in our bedroom the second month of marriage. Not only that, but I had to blast the AC, stuff towels under our door, stuff towels under my daughter’s door, turn the fan on in both rooms, and sleep in her room with her. He snuck into her room and farted when I was almost asleep so that I would start dry heaving. I had to start sleeping with the door locked with her.

I started routine prescription nausea medicine to keep my food down at night, just in case, because it was becoming kind of health hazard because of how sick it was making me.

When I asked him if he thought the amount of food he was inhaling every night was causing his farts, he said yes. I asked if maybe he could slow down or substitute for healthier snacks, such as sea salt popcorn, or a bit lighter and less full of thick cheese snacks, and he said no. His reasoning? He said he likes the way the farts feel exiting his butt as they vibrate his prostate and butt hole. Like I’m not even kidding-HE FREAKING SAID THAT.

I’m so horrified that I even typed that.

My life became a living nightmare as I could no longer sleep in my room and also remain alive. My desk was in my room, so I also had to stop working in the daytime from my bedroom. He works from home in the bedroom too. I had to change the entire situation just to cater to the pleasure of his farts. 

 I tried desperately to get him to go to a doctor, I found referrals to gastroenterologists, I bought him probiotics enzymes, milk substitutes, I cooked healthy meals, he would literally tell me he didn’t want the healthy meal and drive himself to Taco Bell instead. He refused to go to the doctor. He took the probiotic sometimes but usually just pretended to and slipped them by his nightstand so I wouldn’t see that he didn’t take them.

Knowing I was going to have to remain on prescription nausea meds, possibly for life, just to cohabitate with this man was so mind blowing. Our budget was going crazy to keep up with the demands of the amount of food needed to keep his farting for pleasure needs met. At one point, he literally inhaled so much food so fast and so nonstop that he gained 12 pounds in 48 hours and he looked at the scale and screamed. 

I tried to get him into therapy and a psychiatrist, but no. I am a very body positive person that does not fat shame and genuinely believes that you should eat what makes you feel healthy and good and not worry about hitting some numbers on a scale.

The situation, however, feels like a very disastrous issue that is very weird and not very common, something that people probably can’t relate to because it’s just completely absurd in every way. 

He said he will always choose that vibrational fart feeling and the fart smell and the grease snacks and the cheese above me. He said that is a hill he is forever willing to die on.

Anyway, that is the story of why I am [REDACTED_NAME] my husband over farts. On the surface level, I know it sounds like it’s just about farts and then I’m just a really shallow wife, but I think it’s actually so much deeper. It’s just hard to explain how.

1ksw8kc,1747934052.0,2025-05-22 17:14:12,stories,"I work on cargo ships. A scarred whale began acting erratically around us. We thought it was the danger. We were wrong. So, so wrong","

 I work on cargo ships, long hauls across the empty stretches of ocean. It’s usually monotonous – the endless blue, the thrum of the engines, the routine. But this last trip… this last trip was different.

It started about ten days out from port, somewhere in the Pacific. I was on a late watch, just me and the stars and the hiss of the bow cutting through the water. That’s when I first saw it. A disturbance in the dark water off the port side, too large to be dolphins, too deliberate for a random wave. Then, a plume of mist shot up, illuminated briefly by the deck lights. A whale. Not unheard of, but this one was big. Really big. And it was close.

The next morning, it was still there, keeping pace with us. A few of the other guys spotted it. Our bosun, a weathered old hand on the sea, squinted at it through his binoculars. ""Humpback, by the looks of it,"" he grunted. ""Big fella. Lost his pod, maybe.""

But there was something off about it. It wasn’t just its size, though it was easily one of the largest I’d ever seen, rivaling the length of some of our smaller tenders. It was its back. It was a roadmap of scars. Not just the usual nicks and scrapes you see from barnacles or minor tussles. These were huge, gouged-out marks, some pale and old, others a more recent, angry pink. Long, tearing slashes, and circular, crater-like depressions. It looked like it had been through a war.

And it was alone. Whales, especially humpbacks, are often social. This one was a solitary giant, a scarred sentinel in the vast, empty ocean. And it was following us. Not just swimming in the same general direction, but actively shadowing our ship. If we adjusted course, it adjusted too, maintaining its position a few hundred yards off our port side. This went on for the rest of the day. Some of the crew found it a novelty, a bit of wildlife to break the tedium. I just found it… unsettling. There was an intelligence in the way it moved, in the occasional roll that brought a massive, dark eye to the surface, seemingly looking right at us.

The second day was the same. The whale was our constant companion. The novelty had worn off for most. Now, it was just… there. A silent, scarred presence. I spent a lot of my off-hours watching it. There was a weird sort of gravity to it. I couldn’t shake the feeling that its presence meant something, though I couldn’t imagine what. The scars on its back fascinated and repulsed me. What could do that to something so immense? A propeller from a massive ship? An orca attack, but on a scale I’d never heard of?

Then, late on the second day of its appearance, something else happened. Our ship started to lose speed. Not drastically at first, just a subtle change in the engine's rhythm, a slight decrease in the vibration underfoot. The Chief Engineer, a perpetually stressed man, was down in the engine room for hours. Word came up that there was some kind of issue with one of the propeller shafts, or maybe a fuel line clog. Nothing critical, they said, but we’d be running at reduced speed for a while, at least until they could isolate the problem.

That’s when the whale’s behavior changed.

It was dusk. The ocean was turning that deep, bruised purple it gets before full night. I was leaning on the rail, watching it. The ship was noticeably slower now, the wake less pronounced. Suddenly, the whale surged forward, closing the distance between us with alarming speed. It dove, then resurfaced right beside the hull, maybe twenty yards out. And then it hit us.

The sound was like a muffled explosion, a deep, resonant THUMP that vibrated through the entire vessel. Metal groaned. I stumbled, grabbing the rail. On the bridge, I heard someone shout.
The whale surfaced again, its scarred back glistening, and then, with a deliberate, powerful thrust of its tail, it slammed its massive body into our hull again. THUMP.

This time, alarms started blaring.
""What in the hell?"" someone yelled from the deck below.
The Captain was on the wing of the bridge, her voice cutting through the sudden chaos. ""All hands, report! What was that?""

The whale hit us a third time. This wasn't a curious nudge. This was an attack. It was ramming us. The impacts were heavy enough to make you think it could actually breach the hull if it hit a weak spot. Panic started to set in. A creature that size, actively hostile… we were a steel ship, sure, but the ocean is a big place, and out here, you’re very much on your own.

A few of the guys, deckhands mostly, grabbed gaff hooks and whatever heavy tools they could find, rushing to the side, yelling, trying to scare it off. The bosun appeared with a flare gun, firing a bright red star over its head. The whale just ignored it, preparing for another run.

""Get the rifles!"" someone shouted. I think it was the Second Mate. ""We need to drive it off!""

I felt a cold knot in my stomach. Shooting it? A whale? It felt monstrously wrong, but it was also ramming a multi-ton steel vessel, and that was just insane. It could cripple us, or worse, damage itself fatally on our hull.

Before anyone could get a clear shot, as a group of crew members gathered with rifles on the deck, the whale suddenly dove. Deep. It vanished into the darkening water as if it had never been there. The immediate assumption was that the show of force, the men lining the rail, had scared it off. We waited, tense, for a long five minutes. Nothing. The ship continued its slow, laborious crawl through the water.

The Captain ordered damage assessments. Miraculously, apart from some scraped paint and a few dented plates above the waterline, our ship seemed okay. But the mood was grim. What if it came back? Why would a whale do that? Rabies? Some weird sickness?

""It's the slowdown,"" The veteran sailor said, his voice low, as he stood beside me later, staring out at the black water. ""Animals can sense weakness. Ship's wounded, moving slow. Maybe it thinks we're easy prey, or dying.""
""Prey?"" I asked. ""It's a baleen whale, isn't it? It eats krill.""
The veteran sailor just shrugged, his weathered face unreadable in the dim deck lights. ""Nature's a strange thing, kid. Out here, anything's possible.""

The engine problems persisted. We were making maybe half our usual speed. Every creak of the ship, every unusual slap of a wave against the hull, had us jumping. The whale didn't reappear for the rest of the night, or so we thought.

My watch came around again in the dead of night, the hours between 2 and 4 a.m. The deck was mostly deserted. The sea was calm, black glass under a star-dusted sky. I was trying to stay alert, scanning the water, my nerves still frayed. And then, I saw it. A faint ripple, then the gleam of a wet back, much closer this time. It was the whale. It had returned, but only when the deck was quiet, when I was, for all intents and purposes, alone.

My heart hammered. I reached for my radio, ready to call it in. But then it did something that made me pause. It didn't charge. It just swam parallel to us, very close, its massive body a dark shadow in the water. It let out a long, low moan, a sound that seemed to vibrate in my bones more than I heard it with my ears. It was an incredibly mournful, almost pained sound. Then, it slowly, deliberately, bumped against the hull. Not a slam, not an attack. A bump. Like a colossal cat rubbing against your leg. Thump. Then another. Thump.

It was the strangest thing. It was looking right at me, I swear it. One huge, dark eye, visible as it rolled slightly. It seemed… I don’t know… desperate? It kept bumping the ship, always on the port side where I stood, always these strange, almost gentle impacts.

I didn’t call it in. I just watched. This wasn’t the aggressive creature from before. This was something else. It continued this for nearly an hour. The moment I saw another crew member, a sleepy-looking engineer on his way to the galley, emerge onto the deck further aft, the whale sank silently beneath the waves and was gone. It was as if it only wanted me to see it, to witness this bizarre, pleading behavior.

The next day, the engineers were still wrestling with the engines. We were still slow. And the whale kept up its strange pattern. During the day, if a crowd was on deck, it stayed away, or if it did approach and men rushed to the rails with shouts or weapons, it would dive and disappear. But if I was alone on deck, or if it was just me and maybe one other person who wasn't paying attention to the water, it would come close. It would start the bumping. Not hard, not damaging, but persistent. Thump… thump… thump… It was eerie. It felt like it was trying to communicate something.

The other crew were mostly convinced it was mad, or that the ship’s vibrations, altered by the engine trouble, were agitating it. The talk of shooting it became more serious. The Captain was hesitant, thankfully. International maritime laws about protected species, but also, I think, a sailor’s reluctance to harm such a creature unless absolutely necessary. Still, rifles were kept ready.

I started to feel a strange connection to it. Those scars… that mournful sound it made when it was just me… It didn’t feel like aggression. It felt like a warning. Or a plea. But for what? I’d stare at its scarred back and wonder again what could inflict such wounds. The gashes looked like they were made by something with immense claws, or teeth that weren't like a shark's. The circular marks were even weirder, almost like suction cups, but grotesquely large, and with torn edges.

The morning it all ended, I was on the dawn watch. The sky was just beginning to lighten in the east, a pale, grey smear. The sea was flat, oily. We were still crawling. The whale was there, off the port side, as usual. It had been quiet for the last few hours, just keeping pace. I felt a profound weariness. Three days of this. Three days of the ship being crippled, three days of this scarred giant shadowing us, its intentions a terrifying enigma.

I remember sipping lukewarm coffee, staring out at the horizon, when I saw the whale react. It suddenly arched its back, its massive tail lifting high out of the water before it brought it down with a tremendous slap. The sound cracked across the quiet morning like a gunshot. Then it dove, a panicked, desperate dive, not the slow, deliberate submergence I was used to. It went straight down, leaving a swirling vortex on the surface.

""What the hell now?"" I muttered, gripping the rail. My eyes scanned the water where it had disappeared. And then I saw it.
Further back, maybe half a mile behind us, something else was on the surface. At first, it was just a disturbance, a dark shape in the grey water. But it was moving fast, incredibly fast, closing the distance to where the whale had been. It wasn't a ship. It wasn't any whale I'd ever seen.

As it got closer, still mostly submerged, I could see its back. It was long, dark, and glistening, but it wasn’t smooth like a whale’s. It had ridges, and… things sticking out of it. Two of them, on either side of its spine, arcing up and then back. They weren’t fins. Not like a shark’s dorsal fin, or a whale’s flippers. They were… they looked like wings. Leathery, membranous wings, like a bat’s, but colossal, and with no feathers, just bare, dark flesh stretched over a bony framework. They weren’t flapping; they were held semi-furled against its back, cutting through the water like grotesque sails. The thing was slicing through the ocean at a speed that made our struggling cargo ship look stationary.

A cold dread, so absolute it was almost paralyzing, seized me. This was what the whale was running from. This was the source of its scars.

The winged thing reached the spot where our whale had dived. It didn't slow. It just… tilted, and slipped beneath the surface without a splash, as if the ocean were a veil it simply passed through.
For a minute, nothing. The sea was calm again. Deceptively so. I was shaking, my coffee cup clattering against the saucer I’d left on the railing. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what I’d just seen. Flesh wings? In the ocean?

Then, the water began to change color.
Slowly at first, then with horrifying speed, a bloom of red spread outwards from the spot where they’d both gone down. A slick, dark, crimson stain on the grey morning sea. It grew wider and wider.
The whale. Our whale.
I felt sick. A profound sense of horror and, strangely, loss. That scarred giant, with its mournful cries and strange, bumping pleas. It hadn't been trying to hurt us. It had been terrified. It had been trying to get our attention, trying to warn us, maybe even seeking refuge with the only other large thing in that empty stretch of ocean – our ship. And when we slowed down, when we became vulnerable… it must have known we were drawing its hunter closer. Or maybe it was trying to get us to move faster, to escape. The slamming… it was desperate.

The blood slick was vast now, a hideous smear on the calm water. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. My crewmates were starting to stir, a few coming out on deck, drawn by the dawn. I heard someone ask, ""What's that? Oil spill?""

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. I was still staring at the bloody water, a good quarter mile astern now as we slowly pulled away. And then, something broke the surface in the middle of it.

It rose slowly, terribly. It wasn't the whale.
First, a section of that ridged, dark back, then those hideous, furled wings of flesh. And then… its head.
Or what passed for a head.
There were no eyes that I could see. No discernible features, really, except for what was clearly its mouth. It was… a hole. A vast, circular maw, big enough to swallow a small car, and it was lined, packed, with rows upon rows of needle-sharp, glistening teeth, some as long as my arm. They weren’t arranged like a shark’s, in neat rows. They were a chaotic forest of ivory daggers, pointing inwards. The flesh around this nightmare orifice was pale and rubbery, like something that had never seen the sun. It just… was. A vertical abyss of teeth, hovering above the bloodstained water.

It wasn’t looking at the ship, not in a general sense. It was higher out of the water than I would have thought possible for something of that bulk without any visible means of buoyancy beyond the slight unfurling of those terrible wings, which seemed to tread water with a slow, obscene power. It rotated, slowly. And then it stopped.

And I knew, with a certainty that froze the marrow in my bones, that it was looking at me.

There were no eyes. I will swear to that until the day I die. There was nothing on that featureless, toothed head that could be called an eye. But I felt its gaze. A cold, ancient, utterly alien regard. It wasn't curious. It wasn't even malevolent, not in a way I could understand. It was like being assessed by a butcher. A focused, chilling attention, right on me, standing there on the deck of our vessel.

Time seemed to stop. The sounds of the ship, the distant chatter of the waking crew, faded away. It was just me, and that… thing, staring at each other across a widening expanse of bloody water. I could feel my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest. I couldn’t breathe.

Then, the Chief Engineer came up beside me, the same one who’d been battling our engine troubles. ""God Almighty,"" he whispered, his face pale. ""What in the name of all that's holy is that?""
The spell broke. The thing didn't react to the Chief. Its focus, if that’s what it was, remained on me for another second or two. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, it began to sink back beneath the waves, its toothed maw the last thing to disappear into the red.

The Captain was on the bridge wing, binoculars pressed to her eyes, her face a mask of disbelief and horror. Orders were shouted. ""Full power! Get us out of here! Whatever you have to do, Chief, give me everything you've got!""
Suddenly, the engine problem that had plagued us for days seemed… less important. Miraculously, or perhaps spurred by the sheer terror of what we’d just witnessed, the engines roared to life, the ship shuddering as it picked up speed, faster than it had moved in days.

No one spoke for a long time. We just stared back at the bloody patch of water, shrinking in our wake. The silence was heavier than any storm.
The realization hit me fully then, like a physical blow. The whale. The scars. The way it only approached when I was alone, bumping the hull, moaning. It wasn’t trying to hurt us. It was running. It was terrified. It was trying to tell us, trying to warn us. Maybe it even thought our large, metal ship could offer some protection, or that we could help it. When we slowed down, we became a liability, a slow-moving target that might attract its pursuer. Its frantic slamming against the hull when the ship first slowed – it was trying to get us to move, to escape the fate it knew was coming for it. And it had singled me out, for some reason. Maybe I was just the one on watch most often when it was desperate. Maybe it sensed… I don’t know. I don’t want to know.

The rest of the voyage was a blur of hushed conversations, wide eyes, and constant, fearful glances at the ocean. We reported an ""unidentified aggressive marine phenomenon"" and the loss of a whale, but how do you even begin to describe what we saw? Who would believe it? The official log was… sanitized.

We made it to port. I signed off the ship as soon as we docked. I haven’t been back to sea since. I don’t think I ever can.

1gdt7j8,1730087171.0,2024-10-28 03:46:11,stories,Horrific first date overheard at a seafood restaurant,"A heavyset man with red hair and a red beard was sitting across from me to the left at the adjacent table. An elegant young woman with a touch of makeup and saucer eyes sat directly to my left across from him. 

The man began drinking a whiskey cocktail right away. After initially declining, the woman ordered a glass of wine but asked for it to come with her meal. They still brought it out with his drink by mistake. 

The configuration was such that the woman and I shared a booth, although we had separate tables. They were seated at the same time I was. Both appeared to be in their mid twenties. This was a mid-tier restaurant in greater Boston. 

I was a little early and my dinner companion was a little late so I spent about 20 minutes listening to these people’s back and forth. This part of the conversation came after about five minutes of small talk driven entirely by the woman. 

Bored waiting for my dinner companion and socially anxious in the restaurant alone, I began noting down their conversation, a habit of mine. I think of it like doodling but with words. 


*Woman:* So I have to be honest, I’ve never gone out with someone from an app before. I’m not all too familiar with how things like this go. 


*Man:* I’ve been on a lot of these. 


*Woman:* That’s nice! 


*Silence.* 


*Woman:* So was there anything you wanted to know about me? 


*Man:* Sure, like what? 


*Woman:* I mean— never mind. So what’s the difference between a journeyman plumber and a regular plumber? 


*Man:* No difference really. 


*Woman:* Oh. Well I had to go to school for four years. You know, to get my degree, for my job. I always thought it was so cool how some people just got right into working. 


*Man:* I have a degree. 



*Woman:* Oh, that’s cool! What in? 



*Man:* Communications. 


*Woman:* Really?


*Man:* Yeah. What? 



*Woman:* That just caught me a little by surprise. Only because you’re now working in plumbing, I mean. 


*Man:* Sure do. 



*Woman:* You know, I get nervous on first dates sometimes, and I can talk way too much. Don’t hesitate to jump in.  


*Man:* You’re fine. 


*Woman:* So have you lived out here your whole life? 


*Man:* Whole life. 



*Woman:* When people ask me where I’m from I’m never quite sure how to answer because I actually grew up on a houseboat and—


*Man:* Is that why you picked a seafood place? 


*Woman:* Oh, haha. That’s a good one. I’ve never gotten that one. 



*Man stares blankly* 



*Woman:* No, actually my family doesn’t know the first thing about fishing. My parents are marine biologists. They basically research whales. Like how George pretended to on Seinfeld but for real. So we were—


*Man:* You can eat whales?



*Woman:* Uh… No. 



*Man:* Oh. 



*Woman:* Are you feeling alright? If this isn’t a good time or I said something that rubbed you the wrong way, we can do this some other time. 


*Man:* No, you’re fine. 



*Woman:* You know, funny story, I actually studied something different from what I ended up doing for work also. I majored in physics and I only minored in music because I wanted accountability to not forget how to play the piano while I was busy with school. But I enjoyed it so much I thought “Why not take a year and just do music stuff.” And the rest is history. If you’d told me I’d be a professional this time ten years ago I’d have laughed at you. 



*Man:* What kind of money you make doing that? 



*Woman:* Excuse me? 



*Man:* What kind of money you make doing that? 



*Woman:* Oh, you know. It varies. 



*Man:* That’s what I figured. 



*Woman:* Have you been watching anything good on Netflix lately? I’m binging some of my favorite shows from growing up and watching them at such a different stage of life is kind of interesting. 



*Man studies the menu* 


*Woman:* Anything look good to you? 


*Man:* Not really. I’m gonna see if they can just do a regular burger. 


*Woman:* I apologize, I should have checked if you like seafood. 


*Man:* I do. This stuff’s just more or less really overpriced for this area. 



*Woman:* Oh, I wasn’t expecting you to pay. 



*Man:* So you’re paying? Cool, maybe I’ll get something else then too. 


*Woman:* Haha. 


*Man:* What? 



*Woman:* Oh, you’re— You were making a joke right? 



*Man:* What joke?


*Woman:* I meant I didn’t expect you to pay for my half. 


*Man:* Oh. 


*Woman:* You know, I’m not super hungry. I might just stick with the glass of wine. 



*Man:* Okay. I’ll hurry up and order then. The service is mad slow in here it seems like. 



*Woman:* So besides work what are your you know, interests and things?


*Man:* Sports. 


*Woman:* Oh, I like sports too! What do you play? 


*Man:* I had a moment in high school but now I just watch. Would’ve gone pro if that had been what I wanted. 



*Woman:* Uh huh. What else? Oh, I know. Desert island book choice. 



*Man:* I’ve never been to the desert or anything. I kind of like to stay close to home. 



*Woman:* Yeah. Well, I’m actually feeling a little off tonight. I think I might have to call it a night. 



*Man:* Oh, okay. 



*Woman:* I’m just going to go pay for this at the bar. 


*Man:* Okay. 



*Woman:* Well… Yeah. So, have a nice night then. 


*Man:* Yeah yeah, you too. This was chill. I’ll text you. 



*Woman:* Goodbye. 


For all his talk about the pricing, he did stay and eat his off-menu burger. I feel like I hear these non-conversations more and more often, where one or both parties bring nothing to the table and seem like they’re just trying to get it over with. From very new couples to people who seem to have been together a long time. 

Of course this is an extreme example. But the number of young people,  young men in particular, who I encounter that are just existing and seem to make no effort towards *living* is staggering to me. It feels different than even five years ago, when I was on the dating scene. 

Maybe it’s just me. In any case, thanks for reading the story if you’ve come this far!

1lhhmdp,1750575183.0,2025-06-22 06:53:03,stories,I cancelled the hotel reservations for his daughter's wedding less than 30 days before,"It started off bad. I got the call in April.

""Hello, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] Martinez. I'm a lawyer in Washington, DC. My daughter is getting married on September 7th and I need to hold 10 rooms...""

The conversation lasted 30 minutes, during which I learned:

1. Greg was a lawyer (x3)
2. His daughter was getting married (x2)
3. The wedding venue was a nearby boutique hotel. The venue was expensive, so he was hoping to save money booking at my place.
4. He didn't want to reserve the rooms; he wanted me to hold them for his family to book, individually. (x2)
5. Since they were taking the entire house, he wanted a group discount. (x5)

I informed him that there would be no discounts of any kind for that time period, as the local football team was scheduled for a home game. I also required two night stays. I tried to sound firm to discourage haggling, but it was an uphill battle. About half of the conversation was composed of repeated requests and denials. At the end of the call, I promised to hold the rooms, but required a signed contract and a deposit.

So, I typed up a contract for the first time, ever. The entire time, I was very conscious that he was a lawyer and pushy for favorable terms. I sent the contract to him, hoping not to hear back. But the signed contract was sent back the next day. I updated the computer to reflect the deal. I also left a copy of the contract at the computer for staff to review.

The next day, Greg's mother called. I spent 15 minutes explaining to her that she had to book two nights to satisfy the contract, but eventually she declined. The next day, she called back and made a one-night reservation with an employee. I was annoyed. When I discovered the mistake, I decided to let it slide. But I locked the room block so that only I could book more rooms.

Over the next week, I had many conversations with Greg's family. It was always the same: ""I want one night, just like grandma, and group discounts are really what we deserve."" I resisted these demands to much frustration. I was spending a lot of time explaining the contract to the family, but they had difficulty understanding.

Over the next few months, I had many more conversations with Greg and family. If they couldn't get discounts, they wanted upgrades or special favors. The entitlement and persistence were making me anxious and angry. More than one told me ""that the customer is always right."" Infuriating. We had a deal.

Greg, in particular, was maddening. We had three conversations specifically about one-night room requests. His logic said that since I had already agreed to one exception, there was some kind obligation/expectation that more should follow. I am [REDACTED_NAME] a lawyer and I think he intended to exploit my ignorance. But I remained firm. And increasingly angry.

28 days before the reservation, we had another phone call. Greg was hoping for ""wedding amenities"", something I didn't offer, by which he meant ""provide us flowers and champagne"". This was to be instead of a group discount, which was still an expectation, somehow, months later. I was done; feeling exploited and bullied.

""Let me see what my wife thinks,"" I said.

I found my wife and asked her to find the deposit that was required by the contract. The Martinez family money no longer mattered to me. I wanted to find a loophole in the contract. I wanted out. After two hours of very, very detailed searching, my wife came back and told we never deposited a deposit check. It was past due.

My emotions suddenly became a jumble of joy and malice. I spent 5 minutes writing an email to Greg explaining that he'd failed the contract and that his family was no longer welcome to patronize my business. I clicked ""send"". I felt liberated. I no longer cared about being sued or being a bad host. I cancelled the reservations and opened up the rooms to be booked. Every member of Greg's family got a cancellation email, with the notation, ""Ask Greg Martinez about these circumstances"". He can embarrass himself with my input.

I fully expected blowback, but there were no more communications with the Martinez family, except one missive months later. A Martinez, in response to a marketing email, let me know how put out they were having to try to find rooms at the last minute on a busy football weekend. They had to stay out of town and rent a bus. I was a horrible, terrible person. This just made my day.

It's important to remember that the customer is always right. It's equally important to remember that not everybody is a customer.",4111
1f2nziz,1724782395.0,2024-08-27 18:13:15,stories,I just found out why my wedding started late and I love my husband more because of it. ,"My husband, John ""Bucky"" (M26), and I (F24) just returned from our week-long honeymoon two weeks ago. We call my husband ""Bucky"" because he resembles the character from the MCU movies. My Bucky is a bit more yummy.  
Yesterday was the first time we had dinner with his family since the wedding. My sister-in-law (F20) is my favorite person besides my husband, which is why she was my Maid of Honor. She took me aside and told me what happened behind the scenes at my wedding.

A bit of background first: My mother-in-law (F48) never liked me, and she didn't hide it from me, though she did hide it from her son. This started from the moment we began dating. She would play nice in front of him but make nasty comments as soon as he was out of sight. At first, I didn't say anything to Bucky, hoping that, in time, his mother would warm up to me. But it never stopped. Eventually, I had enough and started telling Bucky.

Bucky spoke with his mother, but she claimed I was misunderstanding her. She didn't stop; she just became subtler, saying things that could be interpreted in multiple ways. I don't blame Bucky, he did believe me, but he also believed his mother when she said she meant something else.

When Bucky proposed, I thought that would be the end of it, but she only got sneakier. I almost called off the wedding because I couldn't handle it anymore. We had arguments, and it was frustrating. Bucky always believed me but didn’t believe it was his mother’s intent to be hurtful. Somehow, we got through it and started planning the wedding.

My sister-in-law helped with the wedding planning and preparations, and because my mother-in-law was minimally involved, everything was perfect.

From my perspective, everything went as planned on the wedding day, though we started a bit later. Bucky told me it couldn't be avoided because something important came up last minute. I assumed it was work-related, so I didn’t ask.

But now I've heard from my sister-in-law what actually happened. I was in the bridal suite, so I didn’t see or hear any of this.

My mother-in-law arrived at the venue wearing white. When Bucky found out, he asked my sister-in-law to bring her to his ready room, along with his other siblings and father.

When my mother-in-law walked in and tried to hug him, Bucky stopped her. He asked what she was wearing, and when she dismissed it, he repeated the question differently: Why was she wearing white at his wedding? Why was she trying to hurt his soon-to-be wife? Why was she trying to ruin his wedding day?

I think phrasing it as his day rather than my day got to his mother. He reminded her that it was his wedding too. She still tried to dismiss it, saying he was overreacting and it was just a dress.

That’s when he lost it. He started yelling at his mother, saying that he now realized I wasn't misunderstanding her—she was deliberately being hurtful to me. He yelled that he had been defending her to me all this time, but now it was clear that I was the one who needed defending. He accused his mother of trying to sabotage his relationship. When my father-in-law tried to say something, Bucky shut him down, saying he didn't want to hear it because they had stood by and enabled her behavior.

Bucky then told his mother, ""Because you're my mother, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to postpone the wedding by half an hour to give you a chance to change. I don't care if you go home, to a store, or wherever. Just leave now and only come back when you've changed. If you refuse, you will never see me, my wife, or our future children ever again. Do I make myself clear?""

The wedding was perfect, and my mother-in-law wore a blue dress.

I don't know how to thank this man enough. His birthday is in three months, and I’m going to have to plan something extra special.

","I (26M) come from a pretty big family. My parents came to America from Europe when they were in their early 20s. After settling in, they had 6 kids total. This is about my older two sisters. 

When I was 15, my sister Joy (27F) started dating Tim (30M). The family really liked Tim. He was funny, kind, and had a promising future. I saw how much Joy loved him and how loving he was to her back. Everyone saw how much their love was strong, or at least we thought. 

When I was 16, I was watching the Disney channel with my younger sister since she was 6 at the time and it was nighttime on a Friday. Suddenly, I saw Joy pass by and slammed the door to her room. Joy never EVER slammed doors, even when she was in a bad mood. Before I could get up, my parents came in and told my younger sister to go play or watch TV somewhere else. After she left, my parents sat down and started talking.

Earlier that day, Joy was at her part time job on her break at her part time job when her friend told her something shocking. Our older sister, Jessica (32F) was pregnant and came out of a doctor’s office with Tim. Curious, her friend followed them and saw them make out in the car. The friend took photos and a video of them and showed them to Joy.  After learning this, it took a few seconds for it to sink in. My mom looked like she was about to cry while they told me while my dad barely made eye contact. 

To say the fall out was massive is an understatement. Jessica came back from work one day for dinner (she lived with a friend to be closer to her college). That’s when my parents confronted her about her pregnancy with Tim. After denial, Jessica admitted she was pregnant with Tim’s baby. They had been meeting up secretly for 5 months before she got pregnant. Joy started to sob and scream at Jessica at how she could do this to her. My older brother Jacob, (30M), started yelling too. I just sat back since I didn’t know what to do. After what felt like an hour, Jessica packed the rest of her belongings and left. 

After a week, she contacted me and said if we were still good. She was mistaken that my silence meant I was going to have a relationship with her still. I just told her I didn’t want anything more to do with her and blocked her. 

In a previous post, I said Jessica contacted me a while ago about how Tim was pissed about their recent gender reveal. After the fall out, Jessica married Tim and had their first daughter and another daughter in the summer of 2023. She’s now pregnant with another daughter. Tim is pissed because he wanted a son. Then, just yesterday, Jessica’s MIL contacted me through Facebook if it was true Joy and her husband, Alex (30M) were having a baby boy (they are). I didn’t respond until my wife (25F) started to get harassed. I told Jessica’s MIL to leave my wife out of this. I don’t know why she wants to know why Joy and her husband are having a boy, but I’m not hopeful it’s for any good intentions.  ",2851

When I was 22, I met my girlfriend. I've been open about wanting to be childfree from the very beginning. I remember telling her about my vasectomy, but to be honest, I think there was already alcohol involved. So I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure if she remembers.

We were dating for a year and a half when she moved in with me. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] 25. Two weeks ago, I got home from work, and my girlfriend was standing in the living room smiling. She showed me the positive pregnancy test. Thinking it was a TikTok prank, I played along. When she didn't reveal it was a prank, I knew what had happened, but I continued playing along.

That night, I got up at midnight and started sending emails. I took a week off work and emailed my best friends the details, telling them to pretend they knew nothing and be prepared. The next morning, I left for work as usual, but I didn't go to work. Carl, one of my friends, was waiting outside. He had a cap and a hoodie ready for me. The whole week, we followed Katie, and on day 3, she met up with her affair partner. We followed them to a motel, and then Carl followed him to his home. The guy was married with kids.

We devised a plan. I convinced Katie to go to her parents' house to tell them the good news last Saturday. While there, I gave my friends the keys to my home. At Katie's parents' house, we had lunch with the parents and siblings first, and then Katie told them the good news. Everyone was happy. After a while, I got a call I had to take. It was my friends telling me they were done and ready. So I asked to make an announcement. I pulled Katie aside in front of everyone. I bet they thought I was going to propose. I started by telling how we met, how much she meant to me, and ended with, ""And that's why it hurt so much that you cheated on me and got pregnant by someone else."" The room was silent. Katie looked shocked. She started telling me it wasn't a funny joke. I said I'm [REDACTED_NAME] joking. The moment you told me you were pregnant, I knew you cheated. I got a vasectomy five years ago, and I go to check-ups every year. So if you're pregnant, you have cheated.

At that moment, her phone rang. I told her to answer it. It was probably \[AP's full name\]. You know, the REAL father of your baby. Probably wants to talk about you moving in. Not sure if his wife and kids are going to like that.

What happened was that my friends had loaded up everything of Katie's in a U-Haul and brought it to AP's home. When they called me, they were in front of his home for the final part. They rang the doorbell and asked the AP where they could put her things. He was confused, and they handed him and his wife a folder with pictures of him and Katie. And Carl said, ""Since OP is kicking her out, she needs a place to stay. We're just here delivering her things. And since you don't want the woman who is pregnant with your child to stay on the street, we assumed you would take her in."" AP called Katie yelling that she ruined his life and he never wants to see her again.

After hearing him scream over the phone, I said, ""Oh, so his wife doesn't want his mistress and their affair baby living there. So you'll have to stay here. With your parents""  
With that, I walked away, leaving a crying Katie and her confused and angry family behind. My friends brought the U-Haul with her stuff to her parents' house after the AP refused to accept it.

I went home where my sister was waiting for me. She knew everything. This was not part of my plan, but Carl knows me so well. I broke down and cried in my sister's arms. She stayed the weekend taking care of me, allowing me to grieve and process the betrayal.

I decided to surprise her with taylor swift concert tickets, since i knew she really wanted to go. I called in sick the day the tickets dropped and waited in the ticket master cue for 2 hours. finally when it opened up, i bought two seats, for 400 dollars each, presumably one for her, and another for me. When she came back from work that night i surprised her with the tickets, and she was ecstatic. However, when I claimed i was excited to go with her, she got very confused and claimed she thought the two tickets were for her and her best friend, (who is also a big Taylor swift fan). I was very disappointed since I believed that this was an experience we could do together and it would be something we would remember for the rest of our lives. My girlfriend could tell I was upset and said she would be happy to go with me instead. I told her she should go with whoever she wanted to go with more, and to not go with me just because it was what i had planned. After hearing this my girlfriend immediately called her friend and told her that they were going to the taylor swift concert together (ouch). I told my girlfriend that if her friend wanted to go with her she had to pay the 400 dollars for the ticket and her friend agreed to. While my girlfriend and her friend went together and both had a great time I felt betrayed since she chose her over me. While i know my girlfriend’s bff is a much bigger taylor swift fan than me, i was still excited to go since i’ve never been to a concert before, and i like to listen to some of taylor swifts songs. Like i said before i also believed this would be a memory we could both remember together. Should I have done things differently and not given up my ticket so willingly?",12942
17gkyty,1698283756.0,2023-10-26 01:29:16,stories,A quick story about my dating policy for my daughter.,"When my daughter was 5 years old, and just starting kindergarten I would occasionally tell my daughter ""Just remember, no dating and no boyfriends until you turn 30 years old"".

Wishful thinking, I know.

I told her this her first day of kindergarten, and she replied ""okay daddy"".

Then I would tell her the same thing every once in a while.  Not too often to be annoying, but often enough that she knew my rule.

Then one day, later in the school year (it may even have been when she was in 1st grade) as I was getting ready to drop her off at school, once again I said to her ""remember now, no dating and no boyfriends until you turn 30 years old"".

This time she had a totally different reply.

She turned to me, and looked right at me with those eyes that she could use to get whatever she wanted from her dad, and said ""Well, if I get good grades all through school and college, can I start dating when I am 29""?

It took all the willpower I had to not smile and start laughing when she asked that. With a very serious look on my face, I showed her that I was taking a moment to consider what she had just asked.

Then I replied to her ""Hmmm.....Well okay, you've got a deal. If you get good grades all through school and college I will let you start dating at 29"".

She replied, ""okay daddy"", got out of the car, and bounced her way on into school for the day.

For those who are going to ask, yes she waited till she was [REDACTED_ADDRESS]art dating, because she always followed daddy's rules.

Just kidding.

She had her first boyfriend at around 13 years old, breaking her Daddy's heart.

It should probably be: My boyfriend made me realize I was bi

I(24f) thought I was a lesbian until I met my boyfriend(20m). My whole life until last year, I've only dated women, and I get grossed out thinking of myself with a guy. My boyfriend and I met at an event we both volunteered for, and we became friends. We got closer, and I started thinking about him more and more. When I realized that I developed feelings for him, it terrified me. My whole life, I'd thought I was a lesbian, and then I developed feelings for a guy. Everything I knew was wrong. I tried distancing myself from him in hopes the feelings would go away, but they didn't. I kept thinking about him, and I eventually gave in and asked him out. Once I convinced him that I wasn't joking, he accepted, and we started dating.

Dating him wasn't that different than dating a girl. The sex was so weird, but he was so accommodating. The first couple of times, he made sure I was comfortable and he was so careful and gentle. The thought of me with any other guy still grosses me out, but being with my boyfriend makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. I have no idea why he's the only guy I like, but the year we've been together has been probably the best year of my life. He gets me, and he gives the best hugs. We live together, and he's an amazing roommate and an amazing boyfriend.

188h6w4,1701451145.0,2023-12-01 17:19:05,stories,My wife slept with my best friend & now wants to work things out.,"I (36 m) have been with my wife (35f) for 17 years. We have 3 children together. I was always of the mindset that I wanted monogamy in life, one woman to come home to and that id be with for the long haul. I had women try to talk to me over the years but I never pursued it because I was completely content in my marriage, my wife was my dream girl and i never wanted to hurt her. Over the years there was 2 occasions where I discovered she was being unfaithful in our marriage. One was an off and on again affair that lasted a few years with her married coworker & the other was a fling with an ex she'd dated in high school when she went to visit her family states away. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] there will be people who say I am [REDACTED_NAME] which looking back I can't even deny myself but, after a period of seperation with both situations I decided to forgive my wife as I never wanted to raise my children in a broken home like I had been and i really felt like we could make it through it. We were young whenever the situation with her coworker happened so I chalked it up to being young and making dumb choices without thinking.

For a while things were seemingly okay, I never *fully* trusted her but I tried my best to push back my doubts because I knew if I decided to forgive her then I had to do my best to move past it and have a clean slate. It's been 4 years since the 2nd time she'd been unfaithful & I felt like I made the right decision by letting her have that chance to show she still wanted to be in our marriage. She was a different person for years and we were happy and even had various things set in motion for the future of our family.  However, 2 months ago my reality was once again shattered by yet another incident which in my mind was by far worse than the others.

I ended up receiving a message from one of my best friends wives. This friend knew my wife a little, he'd met her in passing but it wasn't like we all hung out together or anything like that for me to even worry about them. We worked together so there was some times my wife would bring him up multiple times while we were talking about work, she would bring me coffee to work and also one for him. I noticed when she did she'd dress in more revealing clothing than she usually wore but i never commented on it. She even convinced me that we should buy him a joint birthday present & take him out for drinks on his birthday. Just little things like that which were obviously weird but like I said I didn't think I had anything to worry about with either of them. To my knowledge he had a good marriage with his wife, he never spoke badly about it so i didnt think hed have any interest either. Not to mention we we'd actually been friends for a very long time and i trusted him. I'd make comments in a joking way to my wife about how she took too much of an interest in him and she laughed it off saying she just wanted to have another couple to be friends with.(she never actually tried to plan anything as far as to hang out with him and his wife as a couple) I agreed they would be good to be friends with so again I never thought too much into the overly friendliness of my wife with him. Turns out I was way wrong not to because I was met with multiple screenshots implying they were engaged in a full out affair. I wanted to get my proof situated before I ended up confronting my wife because I didn't want her to have the opportunity to manipulate the situation or try to lie her way out of it. So I started to go through call logs, credit statements etc. Because I didn't know how far this actually went past the social media screenshots I saw.

When the truth came out, neither of them tried to lie to me about it. I found out they were sneaking off to hotels when she was supposed to be doing doubles at work and he was supposed to be off with family. And that my friend would leave work to go see her at her job basically every day for a month & she'd meet up with him on his lunch breaks. They were even planning a weekend at a hotel for the next weekend before the truth came out. I obviously cut ties with my friend and honestly I have no idea what to do about my situation with my wife. Their affair ended and my wife apologized profusely saying she just got carried away. She said that she'd felt lacking in our marriage with both of us dedicating so much time to work/other things and that my friend was there and a ""nice guy"", she said she let herself envy the way he treated his wife and wished she could've had that with me but was afraid to tell me i wasnt doing enough in our marriage. So in her words, she made a mistake and that she didn't know how to end it once it started. 

 For now we are living in the same house because realistically neither of us have the means to leave right now as her family doesn't live here plus the costs of renting and houses here are absurd and on top of that we still have our children in our house who are all still in school. She is basically trying to do anything to keep me around including telling me I can see women casually outside of our marriage as long as i come home to her she would never hold it against me as cheating. I told her that's not much of a marriage & it's certainly not anything I ever set out to have but she is hellbent on keeping our family together by any means. She's even brought up how we shouldn't let our kids live in a broken home because of our marital issues. 

I guess my wife is under the impression that nothing could make me want out of this marriage and that by offering things like that she thinks will fix our marriage. I guess in a way that is my fault for letting so much slide in the past. I do love her in some ways but at this point I think the love is more just from the fact we have kids together & that I've been with her for nearly 2 decades rather than feelings of being in love. My self confidence is low and my wife is out of my league but still i dont think that's enough of a reason to stay. She claims she loves me and doesn't want to loose all we've built and are building toward but to me I just can't see how that can be true when she was so okay with running around with one of my only friends. I can't trust her, to me her word is meaningless, I forgive her then how long until she goes and does it again? I do think people can make mistakes & be forgiven because people are flawed, but this isn't just one slip up. And truth be told my faith in her is so low I don't even know if there's been more instances on top of the ones I actually know about. My mental state is essentially a puddle of mud right now. 

I'm [REDACTED_NAME] there's probably someone reading this calling me a dumbass and I can't even argue that but yeah basically my life is a shit show and I don't know how to proceed

edit; I'm [REDACTED_NAME] staying with my wife i should have clarified that better. Me saying I don't know how to proceed is more talking about how to go about handling this with my children, I've never dealt with anything legal so the stress of having to meet with lawyers and also not knowing how to go about our living situation. I have enough proof that my wife couldn't flip the switch and take everything from me but as a guy that's always something you have to worry about. Thankyou for your words, and some of you saying I'm a dumbass- trust me I know, can't change that now unfortunately.  Just have to keep moving forward. ",6540
1lee2em,1750244076.0,2025-06-18 10:54:36,stories,I accidentally confessed my love to the wrong person… and now we’ve been together for 3 years.,"So my last story about IKEA just blowned up , so I thought, I should share something about my personal life.

Okay, buckle up because I swear this sounds like a Wattpad story, but it actually happened.

About a 7 year ago, I 25 was *madly* in love with my best friend (let’s call him Sam). We had one of those painfully close friendships where everyone assumed we were already together. I had written a long, emotional message one night where I finally poured out everything how I’d fallen for him, how I couldn’t keep pretending to just be friends, and how terrified I was to lose him if he didn’t feel the same.

The plan was to sit on it, proofread the next day, and *maybe* send it after a bottle of courage. Instead, sleepy-me hit send… not to Sam… but to my classmate *Dan* a guy I barely knew outside of group projects.

Cue the full-body panic. I immediately tried to unsend it, but it was too late. Dan had read it. Then came his reply:

""Wow. I don’t think this was meant for me... but if it *was* I feel the same way.""

I was *mortified*. I explained the situation, apologized, and tried to laugh it off, but Dan wasn’t joking. He said my message made his heart race. That he had noticed me for months. That maybe fate was being weirdly generous.

We went for coffee a few days later just to clear the air. That ""coffee"" lasted 5 hours. We haven’t stopped talking since.

I never did confess to Sam. We drifted naturally, and I realized maybe the idea of him was bigger than the reality. Meanwhile, Dan has been my safe place, my partner, my person for 7 whole years.

Life is *so* weird. But sometimes, the wrong message finds the right person.

**TL;DR:** Tried to confess to my best friend. Sent it to a random classmate by accident. We’re now celebrating our 3-year anniversary.

EDIT - In title it was 7years, i accidently wrote it 3 :(.",4518
1leawtk,1750231408.0,2025-06-18 07:23:28,stories,Reconnected with my high school best friend after 20 years and I've never seen someone fall so far,"I grew up in a small town in Arizona where I met my soon to be best friend, Riley. His parents were also divorced but his family was pretty well off. His dad owned a restaurant in Phoenix and drove really nice vehicles and owned property in Mexico where the family went for vacation a few times a year. His mom worked at a casino at a black jack table and made crazy tips. I pretty much grew up at their house and she would come home at like 2am with a few hundred bucks in cash sometimes. 

Then there's my family. Both parents are alcoholics riding the poverty line. We didn't celebrate any holidays and our vacations were going to Arizona Mills in the valley to get new shoes and eat In and Out. My mom was a dispatcher and then later a housekeeper. My dad couldn't stop drinking and driving so he left the state to avoid prison time. 

Needless to say, Riley's house was awesome to me. I practically grew up there and in high school I started going with he and his dad's family to Mexico in spring and summer breaks. His dad's restaurant was so damn good. We'd pull up on our bikes and they'd just give us whatever we wanted. It honestly, to me, seemed like Riley had it all. He was going to inherit the restaurant, his dad bought him his first car and told him he'd buy him his first house. I won't lie, I did feel jealous sometimes.

Then at the end of high school my family moved away and just like that it's like all my time with Riley was a dream. Never heard from or saw him again. It wasn't surprising as towards the end of high school he made other friends and stopped hanging out with me almost entirely.

I wish I could say my life got better but I was about to find out everything the hard way. I got kicked out at 18, reconnected with my father and it turns out he's a bad guy. I was homeless for 6 months. Moved back to my mother's and not too long after I was homeless living in the basement of a bar. I sometimes would think about Riley. I thought that he's helping running the family restaurant, probably has a stable living situation. Maybe a wife and kids? Who knows but i knew I wasn't doing well. I was depressed and attempted to end my life on more than one occasion, as most recently as 5 years ago. 

4 years ago I moved back to Arizona. My life slowly improved. I have a really good job, friends, an amazing girlfriend that I can't imagine life without. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] educated about finances and mental health. I feel really good and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] of what I've done to get to this better place. 

A few months ago my brother texts me and says that he ran into Riley by complete chance at a truck stop outside of Phoenix. He gave him my number and said Riley would love to reconnect. Soon he and I were texting and made plans to meet. 

A few weeks ago I met him at a bar and I was surprised to see how he almost hasn't changed his appearance since school. Then we start catching up and over the course of the night I learn that it's as if we swapped lives. After high school he started growing weed and got caught trying to sell it. He spent a year in jail for that. He got on probation and immediately started growing and selling again and got caught again and spent a few more years behind bars. He missed his sister's wedding and his father refused to speak to him until he was diagnosed with cancer, which he succumbed to in 2015, while Riley was in prison. He said it emotionally destroyed him. 

His sister ran the family restaurant and he now runs it with her but COVID did a number to their business and he had to pick up another job to avoid losing the business. He developed a gambling problem and lost his first house and second house and still owes an obscene amount of money from that. His mother died in 2022 from cancer and then his grandmother recently. 

A few things I picked up that night was that he has a drinking problem. He says he can't fall asleep without it. That made me move us away from the bar and we just kinda walked around downtown Phoenix and continued our conversation over food. He was also oddly surprised that I was doing better than he thought I was. I almost think that he only wanted to hang out thinking my life was still such a mess so he could feel better about his. He's basically living on the edge of bankruptcy and the only family he really has left is his sister and he's burned her so much that she keeps him at arms length. And I understand where she's coming from. From my perspective this guy had a future set up and he pissed all over it.

So that's my story. It wasn't the happy reunion I was low-key expecting and feel awful for him. But, like he admitted to me, it stems from his poor choices. I've also decided to not pursue a rekindled friendship with him. At the end of the day he and I are wildly different people than we were 20 years ago. I don't think there's anything there and I hope him the best. I really, truly hope he gets his shit together.",2143
1jogsll,1743461879.0,2025-03-31 22:57:59,stories,I worked security at the hotel where one of the biggest musical artists in the world stayed and it was interesting to see how that works.,"I occasionally do weekend security work at one of the swankiest hotels in my city and sometimes big names stay there while they are in town. 

I won't name the celebrity but I will just call her Amy. The one thing that really stood out to me was how every single one of her movements was planned and choreographed. Like I said she is one of the biggest musical artists in the world right now and she would no doubt get swarmed if she walked through a public area and people realized it was her, so shielding her from the public was the number one priority.

All of the hotel staff had a pre-shift meeting with her security team. There was some basic guidelines such as do not speak to her unless spoken to, do not let any guests know she is staying here, do not ask for a picture or an autograph, and let them take the lead. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] all of the security members on her team were carrying weapons of some kind but they were all wearing jackets and I didn't see any firearms on them.

She was driven from the airport to our hotel in a SUV with blacked out windows, and she came in through the loading dock. My only job at that moment was to stand in front of a door leading to the maintenance area to ensure that nobody tried to get through. Like I said, anytime she was moving, it was highly coordinated and choreographed. Everybody had their place and there was nobody in the area that was not part of the team. She did not look at anybody or say anything, she just sauntered in looking kind of miserable TBH.

She was brought up in the freight elevator, and there was members of her security team on every floor in front of the freight elevator to make sure nobody got on while she was still in it. She had a room on the top floor, and that entire floor as well as the floor below it were completely bought out by her and her team.

Guests can only go to the floor that they are staying on by way of swiping their room cards, there were members of her security team posted by the elevators all night just in case somebody somehow snuck onto that floor.

What I got out of the experience was being thankful that I can walk around like a normal person and nobody gives a fuck. I feel like having to be consistently hidden from you and the restrictions that come with that would be pretty miserable.",1942
168yt56,1693752248.0,2023-09-03 14:44:08,stories,My partner cheated and I lost everything,"I (24f) and my ex L (27M) had been together for 6.5 years and had started dating when I was an undergrad. He moved with me to a new city for my graduate degree where we adopted 2 cats and got engaged January of 23. 
He had met B (20f) at work and we all became close friends. We let her stay with us for a week when she needed to escape her ex and helped her move into her new place. In june L started a massive argument right before we went on vacation and broke the new that he thought he was poly and wanted to be able to explore this or he thought he might have to leave me at some point. I’m extremely monogamous and this made me very uncomfortable, but to save my relationship I agreed to try things out casually with B, because I’m bi and I trusted her enough to be vulnerable. My one rule was that nothing sexual should happen with her while the other wasn’t there. 
Fast forward several weeks and he is spending a ton of time with her when I’m not around, including when I’m out of town with friends. When I got back my anxiety that something had happened was overwhelming and I had a breakdown asking if he had cheated while I was gone. He blew up saying he was hurt, and barely spoke to me for a week. One night I couldn’t sleep and went through his phone, for which I had standing permission to do, and found out he had sexted her multiple times while I was in the room, which broke all my rules. I confronted him with the evidence and instead of trying to work it out he said he was moving out. This moving out process took a month. 
After attempting to remain friends, B blew up at me. B threatened me, told me I was a horrible person, that I was pathetic, and mocked me on social media before blocking me. L stayed living in our apartment, sleeping in my bed, and spending time with her even when I asked him not to. Finally after a month of him abusing my generosity and emotionally destroying me, he moved out. I helped him, even though B was there and even though I was badly injured. When I dropped by his new place a few days later with stuff he needed, she was there. He told me never to come back to his apartment and said he wanted to go no contact.

I’m broken. I’m living in an apartment I can’t afford with 2 cats that don’t understand why their dad won’t come home. I lost my best friend and the person I was planning on spending the rest of my life with, and I’m barely coping. I went on a date with a nice guy but I’m terrified to open up to anyone because I don’t feel comfortable being vulnerable, as the last 2 times went so poorly and damaged my mental health so badly. I barely eat because I can’t afford groceries but I can’t move because my cats and I need to stay close to work for my graduate program. I lost a family through this, and I’m not sure how much more I can take.

Edit 1: there’s some concern about ages. I was 18 when we started dating, I turn 25 in 2 months. No pedophilia here friends.

Edit 2: I understand I was naive. I should have stood up for myself. I didn’t know what I was doing. This was my first major relationship. I am [REDACTED_NAME] help. I never said I wasn’t learning from this. I likely won’t see your horrible comments but I hope you feel better from posting them. Thank you to everyone who has been kind. I didn’t ask for anything, I was just trying to get a horrible situation off my chest.",6047

Dinner with my girlfriend and her parents my treat. I had planned it for weeks, down to the dollar. Not because I’m cheap, but because I’m broke and trying to make something of myself. Every cent matters when you’re drowning in student loans and saving for grad school.

The restaurant wasn’t absurdly fancy, but it was the kind of place where they fold the napkins and dim the lights just enough to make you second guess your outfit. I triple checked the menu online before we went. I even skipped lunch to make sure I had breathing room in my budget.

Dinner was nice. Nothing over the top. The server was polite, efficient not warm, not rude. Just did his job. The final bill came to $120.87. I pulled out exactly $135 and told him to keep the change. It was everything I could give without overdrafting my account.

He glanced at the money, then at me, and said,

“You sure about this?”

I smiled, not realizing what was coming. “Yeah, all good.”

He nodded, walked away
and came back less than a minute later.
No food. No receipt. Just my tip in his hand.

“Most people leave 20%, especially here,” he said flatly, offering the cash back like I’d dropped it by mistake.

I stared at him. My ears went hot.
I wanted to disappear into the booth cushion.

I could’ve explained myself.
That I worked two part-time jobs. That I barely made rent.
That I still chose to treat four people to dinner because it mattered to me.

Instead, I took the cash back. Quietly. Like a criminal caught stealing.

“Thanks,” I muttered, choking on pride.

My girlfriend didn’t say anything. Her dad did outside, in the parking lot.

“You didn’t do anything wrong,” he said.
“The man’s just forgotten what trying looks like.”

It hit me harder than I expected.

Because I did try. I always try.
And I wonder how many other people like me are out there people doing their best, being made to feel small for not doing more.

So to that server, wherever you are:

You didn’t just return a tip.
You returned a moment I was proud of.
And you reminded me why the system is broken not because tipping exists, but because grace sometimes doesn’t.",1148

But two weeks later Mrs. Elissa's daughter literally brought the awnser key to the finals and got away with it while bragging to her mum about it. Her daughter redid the finals and got a 27 and was expelled for cheating and her mum? Fired and banned from teaching. Last I heard she was living in her car.",355
1ji7i85,1742758206.0,2025-03-23 19:30:06,stories,Girl left me for a richer guy. The wedding apparently was a shitshow,"This happened many years ago, but I have been wanting to tell this for a while. Back in the happy-go-lucky days of the late 1990s, I had a college girlfriend, Courtney, and like many a young man, I thought she was the one. 

That turned out very inaccurate.

Courtney decided to start seeing someone else, Mike. However, she neglected to tell me about it and started seeing Mike while we were still a couple. I knew of him, mostly that his dad was rich and he was destined to follow in dad's footsteps and attend Harvard Law and work at a prestigious law firm. Which he ultimately did from what little I have heard over the years, but that is for another day.

Upon graduation (all three of us were in the same year), Courtney and Mike decided to break the news to me that they were engaged. When I asked, very loudly, why, Courtney just shrugged and said she needed a husband with prospects (translation: money). And to add the cherry on top, the job that I was offered upon graduation announced there was corporate restructuring and the position had been eliminated.  So, I did what any recent college graduate with whose job plans disappeared and whose girlfriend just ditched him for a richer guy: I joined the Army.

I thought I would do this Army thing for a few years before figuring something out. But by the time I finished with OCS, Ranger School, and assigned to a regiment, it was September 2001. I am [REDACTED_NAME] you can guess how busy those years became.

A year later, as my first tour in Afghanistan was winding down, I received a DVD from Jaime, a college friend who also knew Courtney and Mike and was well aware of what happened between us. A note with the DVD said, please watch, you will love it. The DVD was their wedding. It looked like a high-end venue and the bride was looking every bit as beautiful as I remembered. Things were going as expected until the minister said the speak now part and that was when the gates of hell opened. 

A man stood, someone I did not know, and demanded how could Courtney go through with this. Courtney's face went white and pleading when she saw him. The man, who I dubbed Rick, wanted to know how Courtney could do this him (welcome to the club). Then Rick dropped the bomb: Courtney was carrying their child. 

Mike's face went red as he looked at Rick, then at Courtney, realizing that the woman he was about to marry, the woman who cheated on me with him, was more than likely pregnant and not by him. But that was not the best part. As the wedding guests were probably processing what Rick said, the camera turned as someone else yelled. This time a woman, dubbed Mary, who was very pregnant herself. Any shred of moral high ground Rick had was gone when Mary cradled her belly and demanded to know how Mike was going to take care of their child. 

The DVD ended with the parents of the not-wedded couple pulled their respective kids aside and left the venue. It did not take a genius to figure out that the wedding was called off. And Jaime's note was right, I did love it. It made my day to see the woman who carelessly broke my heart so publicly embarrassed. I showed it to my comrades who found it hilarious. Over a year later, this time in Iraq, that DVD would provide some joy on days when shit had really hit the fan.

I only heard bits and pieces of what happened after the ill-fated wedding. As I said earlier, Mike did go on to be a lawyer and apparently did well. Courtney got a job and went on with her life. I can only guess that they wound up with the other person, or at least raised their kids. Beyond that, I know little and care even less. 

As for me, I stayed in the Army. I would return to Afghanistan and Iraq more than once. I would serve in places I am [REDACTED_NAME] not allowed to discuss and deal with enemies who made Bin Laden look like Gandhi. But those are other stories.",2677

We work in an office setting so like to get up every once in a while and get some fresh air. We walk in a half circle around the building. In the back there are stairs that we like to go down and then back up on our way back for exercise. It's two sets of [REDACTED_ADDRESS]eps.

It was a beautiful sunny day with blue skies. Near the top of the stairs we were in mid-conversation while heading down and all of a sudden I hear him go ""Oh god"" and trip and fall somehow. He rolled down and landed at the bottom in a heap, face first in the concrete. I just stared for a few seconds because it was so sudden. I ran to the bottom while asking if he's ok, but he didn't move or respond. I got close and realized there was blood coming from his head and face and his arms and legs were seized up and stiff when I tried to roll him over.

I freaked out but managed to call 911 while also texting another coworker friend of mine to come outside the office because our friend fell. 911 told me to roll him over and do CPR while they came, which I did.

The ambulance got there about 7 minutes after I called and took him to the hospital, but I'm 99% sure he was already dead when I was doing CPR

I feel really weird about it. Like sad, but also just strange. It's hard to put into words. It doesn't seem real. I will get flashes where I realize what happened and feel an intense tightness in my chest and the severity of it hits me. I keep imagining him laying at the bottom of the stairs face down, and also his torn up face when I was giving him CPR when he was already dead. It's also just really sad because he was one of my best friends at work. I've barely slept since Tuesday, and was full of adrenaline for a full day after it happened.

He was single with no kids or anything. Only has a brother and father who live in other states.

I don't really know why I'm [REDACTED_NAME] all this but I just feel really strange and am wondering if anyone ever experienced something like this.

EDIT: Didn't expect this post to get so much traction. I appreciate all the advice and positive thoughts sent my way. It saddens me that many of you have similar experiences. I can't respond to every comment but I am [REDACTED_NAME] every single one. Thank you!",10435
1ljjyqb,1750792053.0,2025-06-24 19:07:33,stories,I ended up with the girl i used to bully,"Back in grade school, I was this kid who likes to show off and do some random things energetic boys would do. Then this girl called me out telling me that i am a ""special child"" for being too erratic. This is the moment that I started bullying her.

I remember puting a melted chocolate in her seat, making slapstick comics about her and even threw her backpack in the rooftop
She eventually told the teacher, and I, as an immature kid ended up punching her. 

Later on, I found out her dad and my dad were friends. We saw each other at friendly occasion and i couldn't even look her in the eye. I stopped bullying her after that.

When I was 15, our dads planned another occasion.  At one point, while hanging out with the youth, and a girl asked why am i silent, she looked at me and said, ""when _x_ was my classmate, He used to make comics about me and punched me in third grade. I was very shocked as it was my first time”
Everybody laughed.
I just smiled while being embarassed

When i was 17, I saw her walking along the road and offered her a ride. She got in. We had small talks.
Another time, I got invited to dinner at their place. Midway through the meal, her mom looked at me and asked,
“Why don’t you date my daughter?” Everybody laughed and while she said ""MOM!!!"", I couldn't contain my smile that i hid my face our of embarrassment. 

After finishing my college degree at 26 year old, I came back in our place and told her that i wanted to court her.

She said yes.

We’re married now. She still brings up the comics and how i punch her at 3rd grade.",2034

She even made my prom dress herself, sitting up all night stitching the lace so I could feel like a princess when she never got to be one.my “sister” was the family rebel. she got pregnant at seventeen with me and my grandparents forced her to hide it. she wasn’t allowed to drop out so she finished high school while nursing me at night. she never went to her prom because she couldn’t find a dress that hid the baby weight. she used to tell me she stayed home to babysit me but really she just sat there watching TV while I slept in her lap. the truth came out in the ugliest way. i was sixteen fighting with my cousins over some stupid rumor that I was sleeping with her bf. they slap me, grab my hair, I was just crying because they are literally ganging against me. one of them yelled at me, “go cry to your whore mom!or should i say your big sis? idiot!.” i still remember how quiet everything got. they all scattered like cockroaches and left me alone in the yard feeling like my brain was splitting open.i ran inside screaming at my grandparents asking them what do my cousins. they lied at first but she came home from work in her scrubs, heard the yelling and just sank down next to me on the floor. she held my face in her hands and whispered, “i’m so sorry baby, i wanted to tell you so many times.”from then on everything changed but also didn’t. outside I still called her my sister so the neighborhood wouldn’t gossip. inside she was my mom. she told me everything, how my father was an older guy who got her drunk, how he laughed in her face when she begged him to claim me, how he blocked her on Facebook . i don’t think I’ve ever hated someone as much as I hated him in that moment. Btw he now plays ""best dad ever"" with his new fam.even with all that, she’s still the best thing that ever happened to me. when a girl at school called me a whore, i told my mom through tears. the next day she showed up in her beat-up Honda, marched into the principal’s office and made sure that girl and her parents apologized face to face. nobody ever talked about my family again.my cousins stayed weird about it for a while. some said sorry, some never brought it up again. my grandparents and I don’t talk as much as we used to but I’ve learned to forgive them in my own quiet way. btw i am [REDACTED_NAME] just typing this, my mom is the best thing in my life rn. love her to the moon and back.if you’re reading this and your family is sitting on secrets, i hope you find your truth too. it hurts but it’s worth it to know who you really are and who really loves you.",187
1l6ox4n,1749422160.0,2025-06-08 22:36:00,stories,He Said My Mom Kissed Him Then She Dropped a Truth Bomb I Never Saw Coming,"I (25F) recently brought my boyfriend Tyler (28M) to my family’s annual lake retreat in North Carolina. It's a tradition my family’s had for decades renting a few cabins, fishing, kayaking, cooking big meals, and catching up. It's my favorite time of the year.

Tyler and I had been dating for about 6 months. He’s charming, outgoing, and always had a way of making people feel comfortable so I was confident he’d fit in. He'd already met my mom and younger cousins once over dinner, and everything seemed fine. No weird vibes. No red flags.

The retreat started great. Everyone loved Tyler. My uncles were bonding with him over fishing, and my aunts were complimenting his manners. But as the weekend went on, I noticed Tyler getting weird. Distant. Like, we’d go on walks and he’d find reasons to stay back. He stopped holding my hand. Barely made eye contact.

I chalked it up to social burnout. He's an introvert, I thought. Maybe he just needs space.

Then Saturday night came the big cookout. Everyone was prepping food, drinks were flowing, and someone put on an old family playlist. Tyler was nowhere to be found. I asked around. No one had seen him in an hour.

I headed back to our cabin, and when I opened the door, he was there. Sitting on the bed. Red-eyed. Quiet.

He looked up and said, “I have to tell you something, and you’re going to hate me.”

My heart dropped.

I braced myself for the worst. Cheating? Secrets? A secret family?

But he said, “Your mom kissed me.”

I blinked.

“She kissed me when we were alone earlier. In the kitchen. I didn’t kiss her back, I swear. I left and I’ve been sitting here ever since.”

I didn’t know whether to scream, cry, or laugh at the absurdity. My mom? My mom?

So I marched across the cabins, found her by the firepit, pulled her aside, and calmly asked, “Did you kiss Tyler?”

She looked me dead in the eye, sighed, and said, “I did.”

That moment should’ve shattered me. But then she added something that changed everything:

“I kissed him to test him. Because I don’t trust any man who dates my daughter but avoids bonding with her son.”

Boom. Plot twist.

See, I’m a single mom. My son is four, and Tyler’s been amazing with me but always weirdly distant with my kid. My mom had noticed. And instead of talking to me about it, she decided to go full CIA interrogation with a kiss.

I told her that was insane. Reckless. Unfair.

But part of me understood. She’d been burned by men who acted perfect until the moment it counted. She didn’t want that for me.

Tyler and I ended up having a long, intense conversation that night. He admitted he wasn’t ready to be a parent figure, and that he’d been pulling away because of guilt not knowing how to say it.

We broke up the next morning on good terms. I didn’t tell the rest of the family. I didn’t cause a scene.

Instead, I spent the final cookout running around the lake with my little boy, laughing and feeling lighter than I had in weeks. I realized I’d been trying to force a puzzle piece that didn’t fit.

My mom and I are still working on boundaries. But I know she’s fiercely protective of me even if her methods are... dramatic.

And next year? I’m bringing just my son to the retreat. Maybe that’s all I needed in the first place.",963
1652hm8,1693363116.0,2023-08-30 02:38:36,stories,Caught wife sexting…advice?,"To add some context to my title/story.

I (36m) have been married for 12 years to mg wife (33f). We have a best friend relationship where we have always been REALLY close. We also have been through a lot together (we have 3 kids). 

A little context is she was sexually abused by her stepdad. About 7 years ago she started to go to counseling for that and started to give me more details about it. She’s also had a struggle with watching p*rn since she was really young. Her counselor has talked to her about this is how she coped with what happened to her.

Long story short, for the past 5 years or so she has been trying to stop watching it. Once she got “over” the porn she got into erotica literature. And then about a year ago she told me she felt consumed by it and asked me to put parental controls on her phone so she doesn’t. (I did not enforce this, I’m trying to be supportive of her journey. If she didn’t feel bad, I wouldn’t think much about it but she said it sends her into a shame/depression spiral and so she doesn’t like it.)

About 2 years ago I went to counseling with her because she felt like she wanted more from our sex life. I’m fairly routine/quick… and have really tried to be better. But this is basically a reoccurring theme where she feels like she has a higher sex drive than me. I don’t think it’s a higher sex drive to be honest… I think it’s actually that I’m fine doing the same thing every time…. Anyways all this is the backdrop….

Last week we got a letter in the mail about our dental insurance needing renewed, it was in her email and she asked me to renew it. I opened her email in the computer (we share one and use separate chrome profiles). I saw a bunch of stuff in her email that was pretty shocking. I didn’t want to make her feel bad, she has also been in a depression slump so I realized that once again there was a correlation. The next day while kids were at school we went on a walk and I tried to bring up the topic of how she was doing with it all and if that played a role in her mood. She was very resistant to talking so I didn’t push.

A few days later we were going to have sex while the kids were in school, I was waiting for a break in work meetings and she went upstairs, when I went up I realized she was listening to something sexual. Basically she was trying to get herself ready. It kind of blew up because I felt disrespected we argued a bit. I asked if there was anything else I needed to know about and she said no.

I then asked if I could see her phone and she immediately opened it and started deleting something. I asked what it was and figured out she had subscribed to some Patreon accounts that were males moaning and doing stuff for subscribers.

We decided I should join her at her next counseling appointment (tomorrow) and get a perspective on this. The more we talked she was saying her needs weren’t being met by me and then she said she’s been uncomfortable having sex with me for 6 months but she doesn’t know why.

Well today I was home sick and she was out of the house. I had a suspicion there was more she wasn’t sharing. So I logged into her TikTok account (she used to spend Hours on it). Her profile was basically discrete/not revealing her true identity and she was only following strangers… no actual people we know. I went into messages and there were only a few (assumed the rest were deleted) and she had reached out to several guys to “sext” one was while she was on a girls trip in February and she said “I would have used a hook up app but that seems like too much effort so trying to find someone here who’s in the same mood as me”.

I stewed on what to do for 3 hours. I know it was an invasion of privacy but I also just feel like there’s a pattern here and I’m not sure how far it goes. To me texting/messaging a real person is cheating. Prn I can say I’ve never felt it was… just her own struggle. Now I am [REDACTED_NAME] out about how far this goes.

She asked me later today if I logged into her TikTok (my login sent her an email). I told her what I found and she basically shut down. She let me look at her phone and I didn’t find anything else but I feel like she could have deleted it. 

She started to get defensive and say it’s partly my fault because our sex life hasn’t been good enough for her.

How can I trust her again? How do we move beyond this?

TL;DR caught wife texting other guys sexually, what do I do now?",3454

we all kinda just got used to that routine you know we read his note he gives us the biggest smile and goes on his way i always thought it was cool that he still came every day even tho it probably took extra effort for him

but then my coworker she’s kinda quiet type super shy she started taking sign language classes on her own like nobody asked her she just decided she wanted to make him feel more included she didn’t even tell anyone she was doing it she would just sit in the break room on her phone practicing or watch videos during lunch

one day i noticed her practicing in the mirror mouthing out words and doing hand signs i thought she was just being goofy or practicing a dance at first but turns out she was learning so she could actually greet him properly instead of just nodding or awkwardly waving the paper around

last week she finally decided to try she signed good morning to him and when i tell yall the look on his face bro it was pure joy he literally lit up like a christmas tree he started signing back super fast and she was trying her best to keep up she kept laughing and messing up but he was so patient with her

they must’ve stood there for like a good 5 mins just chatting in sign i don’t even know what they were saying but it looked like they were having the best convo ever she looked so proud of herself too and i swear we all just stood there watching with stupid grins on our faces

he ended up giving her this lil handwritten thank you note later that said something like thank you for learning to talk to me it means a lot and she actually teared up and hugged it like it was a golden ticket she taped it on her locker too now every morning they have these mini convos in sign and he’s started teaching her new words too sometimes they even joke around and she tries to sign silly stuff and he corrects her

now the rest of us are all inspired and we started picking up random signs too like good morning thank you have a nice day we still mess up a lot but he always laughs and helps us fix it it turned into this wholesome thing where the whole team is lowkey learning bits of sign language just to make him feel welcome

honestly seeing her effort made me realize how big of a difference small actions can make like she didn’t have to do any of that she just genuinely cared enough to make that connection and now it’s become the most heartwarming part of our mornings

some customers even started noticing and complimenting her and he brings his friends sometimes now and they all sign together and it’s just the cutest thing ever fr it gives me hope for humanity ngl

idk man it just hits different when you see ppl go out of their way to make someone else feel seen and heard we need more ppl like her fr ",3649

I've decided to post it here, because i need to tell it to someone, and because my gf is only person i truly trusted and tell her everything i have noone who i can tell this. I know she and any friend of our is not using reddit so they won't see that story.  
  
Im 27M and my GF28F have been togheter for a past 2 years. It's my 1st serious relationship, and she's only person i truly loved. I mean realy love. I have 4 siblings and mother.  I like my siblings but I do not love them and i hate my mother, because she was abusive physically and mentally. I've never been close with them and I always thought that if you are related by blood, you don't have to love that person, but i knew one thing, if I'll ever have kids i will love them no matter what.   
Becoming a dad was my most important dream. Not just a father, but a DADDY. A man who will do anything for his family, who will watch when his kids takes their first steps, when they sat their first words. I just wanted to be with them, to look at them, to listen them but now i don't know i i still want it. My GF told me she definetly want have kids in future because it was her dream too, to become a mom and she's more than happy to have happy family.  
We liked to make pranks with eachother, but they were innocent jokes like  doorway tape pranks, hiding small plastic spider in the drawer.   
It all happend in this week. In last week we lived like usual, there was no indication that my girlfriend was planning a prank on me. On thursday after i've come back from work, she was sitting concerned on our living room. I imiadetly noticed it and i sit next to her and asked what happend. She then pull out a pregnancy  test and told me is pregnant. I couldn't belived it, i was more than  happy. I hugged her tight and kiss her. She was still concerned, but i was telling her all excited that we will be a parents  and we both know it's big responsibility but we will make it together. Then she asked me to not tell it to anyone yet, because she want do it personaly. I said it's not a problem,  because on sundays we often had dinner at her parents house, so i tough she will tell them then. I was happiest man alive. Before i find out about pregnancy i was looking for an engagement ring.  I wanted to ask her to marry me, but i decided to wait, to buy her ring what she deserves, and do it like it should be. I was excited all day and wanted to spend all time with her, but she was not in the mood. I tough it was hormones, so i didn't push her and let her be alone,  assuring her that I am [REDACTED_NAME] if she needed anything. When we got to bed she was still a bad mood, i've hugged her massaging her belly, telling her that I loved her and we would make it. Before we fall asleep she told me she need to take day  off work. I said it's fine and if she will fell bad to call me and i will come from work earlier to be with her. The next day i woke up before her and like ususal went to work, leaving her a note that I wrote ""You will be perfect mother"". I wanted to assure her that everything would be fine. I texted to her few times during work, but she didn't respond. I was a little worried and i've decided to talk with her later. When i've come back from work, she wasn't at home, so i texted to her and called few times, but she didn't repond. I've called to her mother and sister to ask if they knew where she was, but they didn't. I decided to wait a few hours while I tried to call her many times. After 4-5hours she came back. I went to her and hug her asking if everyhing is fine and she told me ""Yes, now everything is fine"". She told me we need to talk, so we sit and i was waiting what she wanted to say.  At the beginning she said that she was afraid of the pregnancy and knew that she would not be able to be a good mother.  I interrupted her by telling her that she would be a great mother, and as an example I gave her how close she was to her niece, how wonderfully she took care of her, and how much she loved her. She told me this is a different situation and she don't want be mother yet, and with a little smile she told me ""I had an abortion"". I couldn't belived it, so i asked her to say it one more time, and once again she told me she had an abortion.  my heart was completly broken when i heard that and my eyes started to watered with tears and i've asked ""Why? Why did you do it, you said you wanted to be a mother"" I've fell weak and fall on my knees  next to sofa and started crying. I reached out and placed my hand on her stomach, still asking ""Why, why, why?"" I looked her in the eyes  and said ""How could you? HOW COULD YOU KILL MY BABY!?""  I saw it in her eyes she was regreting it, but she wasn't answering. For last time i asked screaming at her ""WHY YOU KILLED MY BABY?!"" Then she started to crying, she was saying it's not like that, and i was all a prank.  I've started crying even harder and sked her if she's still pregnant, but she denied. She said she never has been pregnant and all of it supposed to be a joke. She huged me, saying she was sorry and she didn't tough i will react like this. After few minutes of crying and saying she was sorry i asked her why she did that, why she tough it will be funny, but she couldn't respond to me. I've pushed her away and walk out  saying i need to be alone. She wanted to stop  me but i told her to leave me alone and i walked out. I've took my car and drive off.  I've stoped at parking place about 40km from place where i live. All the time my phone was ringing, I knew it was my GF, but i didn't want to talk with her, so i turn on airplane mode. I unfolded the seat so I could lie on it. For a few hours i was laying on it and i wasn't thinking about anything, but i fell asleep. I woke up when my alarm start ringing. At first i wasn't sure where i was but after a few seconds I remembered what happend yesterday. I've started to cry again. I was cold, because temperature was about 10C It was a saturday but i had go to work. I calmed down after few minutes and went  to work. One of my friend saw something bothering me and asked what happend, and because im not the type a person who shares my problems with others i've just said i've slept bad and have a bad day.  He said ""Shit happens"" gave me a smile and walk on his way. After my shift i drove off my work and during ride i cried again. I was always afraid of becoming a burden to someone, so i decided to sleep again in my car. My phone was dead, so i was just laying on car all day, thinking about what happend.  Everytime  I was trying imagine myself as a dad i couldn't and each time i cried. My heart was shattered, and i didn't know what to do.  
 Today(sunday) i've decided to come back from home and talk with my GF. In next few days i will give update, i don't what to say to her, i don't even know how i will react when i will see her. But i know one thing, she lost my trust, because she knew it was my dream to be a dad and i don't know if i can forgive her.

17q6ps9,1699396766.0,2023-11-07 22:39:26,stories,My boyfriend of 10 years is insecure about not having a boy and I just found out why.,"So my boyfriend and I are high school sweethearts, and have been together since freshman year of high school, we met when I was 15 and he was 16, we hit it off massively and pretty early on in the school year, and have stayed solid ever since. He has a strange relationship with his parents, he had a pretty strong and deep connection with his mother, that I have witnessed multiple times and I tease him sometimes about being a mamas boy, but he didn’t interact with his father much. After we both graduated high school he decided to move in with me in my 2 bedroom apartment, we shared a room and used the other room as a game room where he would play his video games. So about 11 months ago my girl friend had a baby that I would help babysit when she had to work. So while babysitting that little bundle of joy I fell in love hard with that baby, and gained a massive baby fever, and I would constantly ask my boyfriend for him to give me a baby, until 6 months ago when he finally gave in and we started trying for a baby. Then after a few weeks of trying I was finally positive, and overjoyed to say the least. I remember crying for hours from excitement while on FaceTime with my girl friend. So one day my girl friend instructed us to go ultrasound done to see the baby’s gender. I wanted a girl, but my boyfriend seemed pretty confident that we were going to have a boy. After the results came the doctor said we were having not one but two girls. I was obviously excited, but my boyfriend seemed upset, not like on the verge of tears, or raging upset but he seemed disappointed. I tried to ask him what was wrong, but he gave me the usual “Oh nothing babe I’m fine.” That was the same response he always gave me when he was upset or disappointed at something. Fast forward to present day, and I was discussing with my boyfriend on how are we going to tell our parents about the pregnancy. We talked about how he finds my dad “scary as hell”, and how he would be to scared to tell him. I told him that my dad maybe intimidating, but he’s a sorta kind person, and how he likes my boyfriend. Then the conversation shifted to him talking about how “my dad would be disappointed in him for not having a son”. Then I just reassured him that my dad wouldn’t  think that about him and that he has the wrong idea of him. Then I asked him if he was ok, or if he had something to tell me. Then he said No and that I was reading into it too much, and that it doesn’t mean he’s any less of a man because we didn’t have a boy. Which confused me, because I said nothing about him being any less of a man due to the fact we’re not having a boy, but he insisted on saying my father would be angry with him about not having a boy. He started worrying me so I asked him if had a social anxiety problem or something to make him think this way. He nervously said “No I’m just scared of what people think me.” Then I told him that what he just said literally describes society anxiety, but while I said that I noticed he started tearing up. So I asked him what’s wrong and is everything okay, (btw this is also this is the first time I’ve ever seen him cry in the 10 years we’ve been together) after I asked him if he was ok, he started talking about how he wasn’t good enough for me, and how he wasn’t man enough for crying, and for not having a boy and how everyone was going to hate him for not being a true man. I tried to calm him down so we could talk this through, but he started crying harder and harder, as he started rambling about how his father wouldn’t accept him for being weak and not a true man, then he began to explain to me that his father would abuse him, and put this ideology in his head that true men only have boys true men don’t cry, and how my boyfriend would strive and try his hardest to get his father approval, but his father was never proud of anything he did. (To be honest is was kinda hard to understand most of what my boyfriend was saying as he cried but I think that’s the gist of it)
While my boy was venting to me about his trauma he cried so hard his nose started bleeding and he passed out in my arms. What my boyfriend told kept me up so it pretty late when I’m writing this and I don’t know what to do.",3280
1eou43s,1723299456.0,2024-08-10 14:17:36,stories,girl offered me a ride home after we met at the airport,"Was flying back from a bachelor party and waiting at the gate to board. This girl approached me after I noticed her looking at me and she then comes over and asks a question about the boarding order. She was pretty bubbly with me and I felt a bit of a vibe. Didn’t think too much of it and continued to mind my own business. 

Eventually I make my way onto the plane as one of the last to board. It’s assigned seating and who is sitting right next to me. That’s right. Now this is starting to feel like a romcom. 

I sit down and we immediately start chatting and hitting it off. Similar interests and she is going to college in my hometown. Quick flight but chatted a ton the whole way and she’s  asking me tons of questions. 

After landing we just kept talking all the way we from leaving the plane, through the airport, and to the curb. Once outside on she asks how I’m getting home. I tell her Uber and she then offers to give me a ride as her car is parked there. Gladly accepted and away we go. My actual first thought was “hell yea free ride.” 

The whole ride I’m thinking what all the dudes reading this are thinking. Do I invite her in? In short I didn’t. I asked for her # and we ended up texting for a few days and I asked her to get coffee. She politely declined and that was that. 

Even though nothing came of it it’s a great story but I’ll always wonder if I had invited her in would she have accepted? Or was she just a super nice girl with some airport infatuation. Also it should be noted she was a 20 y/o sophomore in college and I was 27 so I took that into account as well. ",2019
1lf5krb,1750321552.0,2025-06-19 08:25:52,stories,"My abusive father kicked me out when I was 17yo. He told me, ""At this rate, you're going to end up on drugs or in jail"". Now he's serving time in prison for possession with intent to distribute","My father and I always seemed to have a difficult relationship. I tried to be a good kid, but it didn't seem like it was enough. 

I struggled through school, having a hard time being able to keep my grades higher than a C. He criticized me for it, saying how I just wasn't applying myself. 

I tried to help out around the house more when he became physically disabled, cleaning the whole house except for his room. He still called me lazy and told me I don't do anything for him. 

He would even accuse me of stealing from him. Not money, though. He thought that I was stealing tools of his and hoarding them in my room. He even thought that I had stolen some of his medicinal plants. I never did any of this. Never once did he think that it might have been the shady crack heads that he invited over regularly.

But because he thought I was stealing from him, he would regularly search my room. He would tear it apart, flipping over my bed, pulling out drawers from my desk, even looking inside the tower of my computer. He found nothing, and when he was done, he would make some excuse for his actions by saying that I must have sold them to my friends to go buy drugs. 

I was getting tired of it. It was starting to become a weekly problem. Each time, he would tear apart my room. Each time, he would find nothing. And every time it happened, I was the one stuck with reorganizing my room.

This went on, almost through my entire teenage years, and I finally had enough. I had to stand up for myself.

One day, he was looking for a set of tools, a bag of wood chisels. He couldn't find them. And so started the accusations.

""Where are my chisels?"" He said.

""I don't know."" I responded

""Don't you lie to me, boy."" 

""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] lying to you.""

""I bet they're up in your room.""

""I don't have your tools."" 

""That's it, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] go look in your room. If I find them up there, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] your ass.""

I had had enough. He was accusing me of something I didn't do again, and it needed to stop.

I stood up, ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] gonna let you tear apart my room again.""

""Excuse me?""

""You do this every time, I said, ""whenever you can't find something of yours, you blame me. You go into my room, tear it apart, and then accuse me of selling it when you can't find it. You're not going in my room."" 

He started to shout, ""I pay for this roof over your head. It's not your room. It's my room. You're lucky enough to even sleep in there.""

I shouted back, ""That's just an excuse to get away with violating your kids' privacy.""

""You're just a child,"" he yelled, ""you don't have the right to privacy while under my roof.""

He took a step towards my room. I bolted, ran past him, booked it up the stairs, slipped into my room and closed, and locked the door. 

He came up after me, jiggled the doorknob, and when he realized it was locked, he started to bang on the door. 

""Open this door right now!"" He screamed.

""No,"" I yelled back, ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] going to let you tear apart my room again.""

He banged on my door, each time harder than the last. I realized he was using his body to try and break the door down. I saw the door frame start to buckle. So, I braced my body against the door.

He felt the resistance from the other side, ""Really? You're gonna block the door?""

""Damn right, I am, you crazy bastard.""

""Fuck this."" He said.

I heard him walk down the stairs. I kept my back braced against the door. I knew it wasn't over. 

He finally came back upstairs, huffing and mumbling something to himself. I heard what sounded like a cord falling to the ground. Then, I was shocked at the next thing I heard.

My father turned on his circular saw. He began cutting through the door. I saw the blade peek through the wood.

He was being extreme, so I decided to be extreme in response. I shouted loud enough to cut through the noise, ""If you wanna cut through this door, you're gonna have to cut through me.""  

He stopped, paused for a moment, ""Then that'll be your own damn fault.""

He started the saw back up. I thought that there was no way he would actually cut his own son, especially with a saw. Sure, he's hit me in the past, but actually drawing blood, that was too much. Then it happened.

I felt the blade nick me in the shoulder. I pulled away instantly. I put my hand on the spot the blade caught me and sure enough, there was blood. 

He actually cut me. I realized then that he was willing to hurt his own child just to get his way, and it he didn't care. 

I stood there, waiting for him to finish cutting through the door. When he made a big enough hole to put half his body through, he reached in and unlocked the door.

When it swung open, I stood in his way, ""Stay out of my room."" 

He stepped forward, looming over me, ""Get the hell out of my way."" 

I pushed him, he stumbled back but he caught himself. He pushed back. I swung, hit him in the jaw. He didn't even flinch.

He pointed a finger at me, ""Hit me like that again and I'm [REDACTED_NAME] the police on your ass.""

""Go ahead,"" I responded, ""whose side do you think they're gonna take? The kid who just wanted his privacy, or the adult who took a saw to his sons door and cut him with the blade?""

He seemed taken aback by this. He realized what this scene would look like to an officer of the law and knew that they would see it as child abuse.

""Get out of my way, boy.""

""If you want me to move, you're gonna have to move me.""

It seemed like that's what he was looking for. He stepped forward, slapped me across the face, picked me up under my armpits, and slammed me on the ground. 

He stepped over me, started tearing apart my room again. I stood up. Grabbed him by the back of his shirt and pulled. He wasn't expecting this, but he whirled around and back handed me. I fell to the ground again.

He stood over me, ""I feed you, clothe you, keep a roof over your head and this is how you treat me? You ungrateful little shit. Get out of my house. Don't come back unless you're crawling on your hands and knees begging to be let back in.""

I stood back up again, grabbed my backpack, and started to put clothes into it.

""What are you doing?"" My father shouted

I said, ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] my clothes.""

""I paid for those clothes, not you. Those are my clothes. You're lucky I'm [REDACTED_NAME] kicking you out butt ass naked.""

""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] some clothes with me,"" I said, ""I'm [REDACTED_NAME] gonna go around in the same clothes for weeks until I get paid.""

He didn't stop me. I packed my bag and went to leave.

Before I made it out the door, I heard my father shout, ""At this rate, you're gonna end up on drugs or in jail."" 

I kept walking. I walked until I felt like I was a safe distance from that house. And when I felt I was far enough away, I collapsed. I started crying. My whole body felt weak. I managed to pull out my phone and call a friend of mine. 

When she picked up, she immediately heard me crying, ""Hey, what's going on, why are you crying?""

I explained what happened, told her I got kicked out, that I didn't know where to go.

She asked me, ""Where are you? I'm [REDACTED_NAME] come pick you up.""

She came and got me. We went over to her place, but she let me know that I wouldn't be able to stay there for long due to her rental agreement. I spent the next couple of hours calling friends and seeing who I could stay with. 

I spent the next couple of months couch hopping, before I finally got a job at a hotel that offered seasonal housing, and then I moved in with another friend of mine, who eventually became my girlfriend. 

Things settled down for me, and I began to finally build up my own life. 

Then one day, almost a year after the incident, one of my friends informed me something about my father. 

""Dude,"" he said, his phone in hand, ""I just looked at the county jail roster. Your dad's in jail.""

""What?"" I responded, ""Let me see that.""

I looked, and sure enough, there he was. His mugshot a face of sour aggression. 

Apparently, my father had gone over to someone's house with a friend of his to help this friend get her clothes back. When he got there he was greeted at his truck window by one of the brothers that lived there. My father explained that he was just there to help his friend get her clothes back, but when he looked back at his friend in the truck, he felt something hard hit him in the back of the head. 

From his statement, my father blacked out, and his years of training from being in the Marines in his youth took over. He reached down into his door, pulled out his revolver, pointed it out the window, and emptied the cylinder. 

Six shot fired off and three of them had struck one of the brothers living in that house. He was dead on the scene.

When my father came to, he didn't know what had happened, and he said he was confused as to why he woke up in a jail cell.

He was tried. He plead self defense. His lawyer made a plea deal. But the judge wasn't having it. The judge said that his story was suspicious due to my father's checkered criminal background and that she need to see all the evidence before making a verdict. 

After eight months of court hearings, the case was finally dropped. The judge found that there was insufficient evidence to be able to prosecute my father due to the fact that all the eye witnesses that night were all high on methamphetamines. He was to be let go.

But, on the day my father was to be released, he was picked up by two agents of the FBI, driven to the nearest state penitentiary, and was tried, and ultimately plead guilty, to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamines. 

And it wasn't a small amount. It was a lot. 10lbs of methamphetamines were reported to be in his possession at one point. 

He was sentenced to 12 years in a federal penitentiary, with 5 years of supervised probation, totalling up to 17 years. Cosmic justice, if you ask me. He's still in prison to this day.

But he isn't going to be serving the full 12 years. When I looked online at his release date, it says that he'll be getting out of prison on July 17th, 2027. That would only make it eight years of incarceration.

My guess is that he talked. Probably had a couple of agents give him an offer. That if he told them where he got the drugs that they would lighten his sentence. 

But, I know how these things work. You don't just get that amount of drugs without it coming from some kind of gang. He'll probably get out and they'll hunt him down for snitching on their operation.

After all of this went down, I really sat down and thought about it. If he really did talk, and this related to a gang, I could possibly be in danger. 

I shared a last name with him. I kinda looked like him. I still had some of his vocal mannerisms. So, I decided to do something to protect myself. 

I filed to change my last name. That way his name couldn't come back to me. 

I did research into it. Learned about the kinds of questions I would be asked, and how long the hearing would take. They usually last around half an hour. I signed all the paperwork, paid the fees, and was given a date for the hearing as well as the number of the court room I would be in. 

On the day of the hearing, I showed up to the court house. I went to the floor my hearing would be at and looked for my name, and the time they would call me in. 

To my surprise, I found out that they changed the court room I would be in. I didn't know why until I was called in. 

When I sat down and looked at the judge overseeing my hearing, I quietly laughed to myself. 

It was the same judge who oversaw my fathers trial when he killed a man. The same judge who refused to let my father have a plea deal because of his criminal background.

She began the hearing, ""We are here today for the hearing of _________. It is my understanding that you are looking to change your last name. Let me ask you, why are you wishing to do this?""

I leaned into the microphone and said, ""Disassociation from a negative parental figure, your honor.""

She looked down at her papers, nodded her head, picked up a stamp, and marked a sheet of paper, ""From this day forward, you shall now legally be known as ___________ Please, come up to the stand to collect your paperwork.""

I stood up and walked to the stand. When she handed me my paperwork, she gave me a look of pride. Something that told me I was doing the right thing.

I left the courthouse with a new name and newfound confidence. Sure, I still share the same blood as my father, but I don't need to share his last name.

 But I know that when he gets out two years from now that he's going to try and get ahold of me. He's going to try and make up for the years he's abused me. Try and tell me that he's changed. But I won't let him, and he won't be able to find me.

I have a new name. I live in a different state now. I look different than how I did back then.

Even if he has changed. Even if he has made himself a better person, that doesn't mean I have to let him back into my life.

I have learned that blood does not make you family, and for the blood of mine that he let from me that day he kicked me out, he was the one who made that choice to sever me from his life. And I will stand firm on that for the rest of my existence.",102

During one of these breakups, he asked me to return the books he gifted me. I came as a shock and I was really hurt because i love reading. When we got back again,  he shrugged it off whenever I talked about how much that incident hurt me so I swept it under the carpet. Two weeks ago, we had an argument about how he is suspicious of me and invading my privacy by going through my phone. After the argument had died down, I told him I was leaving for a few days (we’ve been living together for 2 months) but he shocked me by saying if I was leaving, I wouldn’t be leaving with the wig he got me.

18ytins,1704416179.0,2024-01-05 00:56:19,stories,28 Days and Everyday I Remember All Over Again,"In August my then 14 month old son was sitting with his big brother when I looked at him and realized how lethargic he was. I thought back and realized he hadn't had a wet diaper since the previous night. Terrified that something might be wrong with his kidneys, I called my husband home from work and rushed my son to the Emergency Department. They said that his blood was too acidic and life flighted him to the nearest children's hospital. The hospital was able to give him the right things to fix his acid levels. But after 2 weeks and numerous tests, they informed us that our sweet boy had a mitochondrial disorder, so each cell in his body made about 5% of the energy it's supposed to. They said his form of the disease had never been seen before so they could not predict how his life and disease would progress.

We brought him home for 5 weeks, and he was fed through a stomach tube the whole time. My husband woke me up at 6am mid October in a panic. ""The baby is blue! I need you to wake up, he needs to go to the hospital."" I threw clothes on, got our son into his car seat and drove straight to the Emergency Department. I had a home oxygen monitor and his oxygen wouldn't go above 75%. We were terrified. Because we live in a rural area, driving him was much faster than an ambulance. They assessed him at the hospital. They said that he needed to go back to the children's hospital again. So I watched a second time as the helicopter flew away with my baby inside. 

The second day in the hospital he went into respiratory failure. They intubated him and put him on a ventilator. He was in the hospital for 2 months. Each time they took him off the ventilator, it was harder and harder for his body to breathe on its own. Even still, I expected him to get better. I thought they would discharge him and we'd bring him home and have years and years left with him. I thought that 5 pneumonias in a row (all contracted in the hospital) were just bumps in the road, that he would eventually get better. 

The first week of December they did an MRI. We got the news no parent should ever hear. Our son's brain stem was irreparably damaged by his illnesses and his underlying disease. The part of his brain that maintained respiratory capacity had died. There was nothing more they could do but make him comfortable. We were told he would be put on hospice at 18 months old. December 7th, the hospital staff drove my son and I home in an ambulance with him on the ventilator. They told us before we took the trip that it might be weeks before he actually passed. They told us there would be time.

When they brought him in the house on the ventilator, I sat on the couch with open arms, finally allowed to hold my boy again. They began removing his breathing tube right away. The second it was removed, I knew. He struggled to take a raspy breath and began to go blue. The nurse told me, ""He's going."" I put my hand to his chest and whispered to him what I whispered everyday he was in the ICU, ""You are my sun, and my moon, and my starlit sky. Without you, I dwell in darkness..."" His few little breaths were horrible, the sound still breaks me. They gave him oxygen but that was never going to be enough and we all knew it. I saw the light leave his eyes as I held him in my arms and he looked at me for his final heartbeats. And then he was just gone.

It's been 28 days and each day that I wake, I remember all over again. I am [REDACTED_NAME] by the echoes of my child's dying breaths. I open my eyes in bed knowing that there is no baby to feed, no baby to kiss and snuggle, nowhere to put all of this love and grief in a tangled mess, ever present inside my chest. Life goes on for everyone around me. And it still doesn't feel real. It's like being caught inside of a nightmare you can't wake up from. And so much of me wants to SCREAM from the rooftops, ""My child died! Doesn't anyone care?!""

I am [REDACTED_NAME] Peru, from a provincial city, when I was 18 years old my cousin, who is the same age as mine, accused me of having raped her, she and I were very close since we were children since we used to spend time together, due to family problems she began to have depression.

&#x200B;

It wasn't like before, now all she did was scream, get angry or even blame me because I didn't have the same problems as her, the truth is I was trying to help her, but my own mental health was beginning to deteriorate so I decided little by little to move away. Months passed and I had no contact with her until one day my father came to my house and called me, I went out to meet him and he received me with a slap in the face, it should be noted that my father had never hit me before, who did that was my mother and only for specific reasons.

&#x200B;

When I ask him about the reason behind the hit, he slapped me again and told me to get out of the house, that his brother (my cousin's father) had told him that my cousin said that I raped her and that's why she was so depressed, apparently her dad realized that she was cutting herself and to get out of it she just blamed me for everything, my cousin didn't press charges (Obviously because there is no proof) but still my dad told me that my uncle wanted to beat me up, my dad was disappointed in me, he hit me again, called me an abuser, insulted me and told me to get out of his house, my mom was always a submissive person with him so she didn't say anything to him, I simply with my lip bleeding grabbed my most valuable things and left, thank God I had my savings on my card from what I had worked for and I was able to go to the capital by public transportation.

&#x200B;

 Once in the capital I managed to rent a small room, I had a bad time for the next few years, I had a couple or two for a few years and jumping from job to job to survive. When I was 20 years old, my partner at that time told me that I could work at the KFC where she worked as a delivery order receptionist. The part-time job paid well and with the bonuses you could even earn double or triple my salary, so I worked there doing the best I could while studying a technical degree in administration.

&#x200B;

Years passed and I ended up becoming a supervisor and then manager of that store thanks to my technical degree in business administration. At the age of 25 I became a partner with a former university classmate with whom I still had contact (She is a lawyer) and the age of 27 we got married, it was a small wedding because both she and I are modest with expenses and because I had no family to invite, we currently have a one-year-old son whom I love with all my soul.

&#x200B;

It was after this that everything went to hell, today in the middle of the afternoon there was a knock at my door, it was my parents, it had been more than a decade since I had seen them, I was frozen but not with fear, but with anger, my dad asked me if he could come in, I told him no, so we talked in a nearby park, in short, they told me that my cousin had committed suicide and that in her letter she confessed the whole truth, that the person who actually abused her was her mother's brother and that everything was orchestrated by him to be able to cover up and other things, the truth is I was very indifferent, for me whoever accuses of those crimes deserves to suffer them in flesh, so I didn't feel sorry for her, I told them kindly (and resisting my urge to yell at them) to go away and never contact me again, that they were dead to me.

&#x200B;

When I stood up from the bench to go home my dad grabbed me by the shoulder, he told me that we have to keep talking, I told him no, he insisted, I told him no, he insisted again, so I turned around and instinctively gave him a hit, I don't know when my dad became so weak, any latino knows that country men are quite strong, but one hit was enough to break his nose, he stood stunned looking at me with his eyes open and his nose bleeding and my Mom was covering her mouth, for some reason that I don't explain, my next reaction was to throw myself at him, it wasn't difficult to knock him to the ground and I continued hitting him, when he started to cover his face I started hitting his head or forehead, I'll not lie, it felt liberating, I felt like I was crying while I hit him and I continued until my right hand was hurting.

&#x200B;

My mother stood still, for some reason she didn't do anything, she just stood there watching and crying, by that time it was already night and in our area it was difficult to find people on the street, even less so considering that today there is a soccer game, my Mom helped my dad and took a taxi, she didn't say anything to me, she didn't scream, she just cried and as soon as she grabbed my dad she ran away, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] lying, if she had tried to intervene maybe she would have gotten the same treatment.

&#x200B;

A few hours later my mother writes to me on my cell phone, apparently they contacted a friend from university (I still have my social networks active) who told them where I lived, saying that my father needs a septum reconstruction because it was perforated and dental reconstruction For having 4 broken teeth, everything was going to cost the equivalent of 4k USD, which is a lor of money here, not a fortune but it’s a lot. 

&#x200B;

I have already been clear with her, I am [REDACTED_NAME] going to put in a single cent, for my sake she and my dad could end up just like my cousin, I don't care, she has been calling me, asking for forgiveness for everything, that she wants to come back into my life , that she was afraid and that she should have protected me or at least believed me, according to her my dad felt the same and according to him he deserves every hit I gave him, I guess we agree on that.

&#x200B;

I told my wife everything, she already knew what happened in the past with my parents, she just told me that she understood, that, according to what I told her, my father died when he kicked me out of his house, so who did I hit was just a stranger with his face, I found her comparison funny and I agreed with her, she told me that if they tried legal measures we would simply say that it was in self-defense, a law was recently passed in which lethal force can even be used when It's about self-defense, so if something happens to him we can rely on that, right now I'm [REDACTED_NAME] I have a lawyer wife, I can't help but feel more liberated after this, my parents aren't poor so I know they'll get the money for the operation, I hope they just aren't idiots enough to come back to my house, this is my home now and if I have to beat them both to get the hell out of my life, I will, at the end of the day, they are the ones who started all this, I was just defending myself.

&#x200B;

I still feel a little euphoric and happy, the truth is, I am a little happy that they are suffering, they deserve it, I am [REDACTED_NAME] with my life and my family, and I would protect them at any cost, that includes my parents. I needed to get this off my chest somehow so I'm [REDACTED_NAME] this to release it, somehow telling it all has made me feel better.

1kgaede,1746552602.0,2025-05-06 17:30:02,stories,I'm a pilot. A passenger once screamed we were being followed by a 'cloud.' We almost ignored him. What we saw next still haunts my flights.,"
Hello everyone, good morning or good evening, depending on where you are. I'm [REDACTED_NAME] sure where or how to begin. The event I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to describe happened not too long ago, perhaps a few months back, but every detail is still etched in my mind. I work as a pilot, and this job has exposed me to many things, situations stranger than fiction, but what happened on this flight… that was something else entirely. Something that has made me think a thousand times every time I take to the skies.

I won't mention the airline's name, the flight number, or any details that could identify anyone involved with me – not myself, not the Captain I was with, not even the flight attendants. Privacy is important, and I don't want any trouble for anyone. Anyway, it was a routine night flight, from an airport in one Arab country to Cairo International. The weather was good, visibility excellent, no weather warnings; everything was proceeding by the book. I was the co-pilot at the time, flying with an experienced captain, a respectable and calm man – let's call him Captain Arthur.

The first hour and a half of the flight passed with utmost calm. We completed our procedures, reached our cruising altitude, the autopilot was engaged, and we were monitoring the instruments, chatting about mundane topics. The engine sound was steady, like a gentle music one gets used to. The passengers were almost all asleep or watching movies. A classic atmosphere for any long-haul night flight.

Suddenly, the cockpit intercom buzzed. It was one of the flight attendants; her voice had a slight note of concern. ""Captain, we have a passenger causing a bit of a disturbance and refusing to stay in his seat. He's saying strange, incoherent things.""

Captain Arthur responded calmly, as was his nature:

 ""Strange things like what? Does he seem intoxicated, or what's the situation?""

The flight attendant replied, 

""No, Captain, he looks perfectly normal but terrified, literally terrified. He keeps saying he must talk to you, that he needs to warn you about something very important. We've tried to calm him down and explain that we don't allow passengers into the cockpit, but he's insistent and shouting loudly, and the other passengers are starting to wake up and get annoyed.""

I looked at Captain Arthur, and he looked at me. This wasn't the first time a passenger had caused a problem, but usually, it was for trivial reasons, or someone was just afraid of flying. But the flight attendant's description of this man – terrified and saying strange things – that was a bit unsettling.

Captain Arthur told the flight attendant:

 ""Alright, try to calm him down again, and tell him the Captain is busy and can't speak to anyone right now. If he continues to cause a disturbance, let me know, and we'll see how to proceed.""

The flight attendant hung up, and we returned to our duties. But honestly, I wasn't comfortable. The word ""terrified"" stuck in my mind. About ten minutes later, the intercom buzzed again. The same flight attendant, but this time her voice was louder and had a noticeable tremor: ""Captain Arthur, the situation is worsening. The man is practically having a breakdown. He's banging on the cockpit door and screaming, saying things no one understands. He's saying, 'It's coming, you have to listen to me, you'll kill us all!' All the passengers are awake and scared of him now.""

That's when Captain Arthur started to genuinely worry. He looked at me and said, ""Check the surveillance cameras by the cockpit door.""
I opened the small screen that displayed what was happening outside the door. The sight was... odd. A man in his late thirties or early forties, dressed in ordinary clothes, his hair disheveled, his eyes wide with a frightening intensity, and filled with tears. He was gesturing wildly with his hands and yelling, his whole body trembling. The flight attendants were around him, trying to pull him away from the door, and he was resisting them with all his might.

Captain Arthur sighed and said, ""This man doesn't look normal at all. Okay, listen, [Flight Attendant's Name], does he have anything in his hands? Any bag? Any sharp object?""
The flight attendant replied with difficulty, trying to speak amidst the commotion: ""No, Captain, his hands are completely empty. He just wants to talk to you.""

Silence filled the cockpit for a few seconds. Captain Arthur was thinking. Safety regulations are very strict about opening the cockpit door during flight, especially for someone in this state. But at the same time, this man was causing panic throughout the aircraft.

After some thought, Captain Arthur said: ""Alright, listen to me carefully. I'll let him speak to us through the external intercom speaker next to the door. Let him stand in front of it and talk, but you all stay around him, and don't leave him unattended. If he tries to make any suspicious move, or if he says anything that threatens the safety of the flight, you will act immediately according to your training.""

The flight attendant said, ""Understood, Captain.""

A few minutes passed, and we could hear muffled sounds of commotion and argument from outside. Then, the flight attendant's voice came through again: ""Captain, he's ready to speak on the intercom.""

Captain Arthur opened the line and said in a firm voice: ""Yes, sir, this is the Captain of the aircraft. Go ahead, tell me what you have to say, quickly and calmly.""

The voice that came from the speaker was choked, breathless, as if he'd been running a marathon. He spoke in broken sentences, in Arabic but with a strange accent, perhaps Levantine or Gulf, I couldn't quite place it at the time due to his agitation.
""Captain... please... you have to believe me... there's something... something behind us... following us.""

Captain Arthur and I exchanged a look of bewilderment. ""What's behind us, sir? The weather is clear, and there are no other aircraft near us on the radar,"" Captain Arthur replied.

The man screamed into the speaker: ""No! No! Not an aircraft! It's... it's a cloud! A strange cloud! It's chasing us! I've been seeing it from the window since we took off! It's getting closer every minute!""

A cloud? We were at an altitude of over 35,000 feet. Most clouds are far below us, except for certain types of massive cumulonimbus clouds, and those show up on the weather radar from a distance, and we avoid them. Our radar was clean as a whistle.

Captain Arthur tried to calm him: ""Sir, there are no clouds behind us or around us. We can see the instruments clearly, and the weather is perfectly clear. Perhaps you're just a bit anxious about flying?""

The man's voice became filled with a terrible despair: ""No! I swear to God I see it! It's black! Black and huge! And shapeless! It's like... like it's watching us! Please look carefully! Look with your own eyes! You'll kill us all if you keep disbelieving me!""

I started to feel a genuine sense of unease. The tone of his voice wasn't an act. This was raw terror. Captain Arthur, despite his skepticism, told the flight attendant: ""Have him describe its exact location relative to the aircraft.""

The man began to describe, still shouting: ""Behind the tail! Slightly to the left of the tail! It's huge! It's swallowing the stars behind it! It's getting bigger every moment!""

Captain Arthur looked at me and said quietly, ""Take a look out the cockpit window, towards the left rear, but be discreet, don't make it obvious.""

The cockpit has small side windows. I got up slowly, trying to crane my neck and look as far back to the left as possible. The sky was clear, the stars shining brightly. There was no trace of any clouds. I sat back down.

""Nothing there, Captain. The sky is perfectly clear,"" I said, trying to reassure myself before reassuring him.

Captain Arthur spoke to the man again: ""Sir, we've looked ourselves. There's nothing there. You need to calm down and have a glass of water. The flight attendant will help you.""

But the man burst into tears and screams: ""No! You can't see it! It's hiding from you! It knows you're looking! You have to do something! You have to get away from it!""

Captain Arthur had clearly lost his patience. He told the flight attendant: ""That's enough. Try to get him back in his seat, any way you can. If he refuses, use restraints if you have to. Notify airport security as soon as we arrive.""

We closed the intercom, and a heavy silence descended upon the cockpit. I still felt uneasy. Captain Arthur noticed this and said, ""Don't worry. It's just a panic attack. It happens sometimes. The safety of the other passengers is what matters.""

I tried to focus on the instruments, but the man's words about ""the cloud that's chasing us"" kept ringing in my ears. About fifteen minutes later, I was routinely scanning the navigation displays when I noticed something strange on the weather radar screen. A very small blip, on the edge of the radar's range, in roughly the same direction the man had described. It was appearing and disappearing.

I said to Captain Arthur, ""Captain, take a look at the weather radar. There's like... a very faint signal towards our seven or eight o'clock."" (Meaning the rear left of the aircraft).

Captain Arthur leaned closer to the screen and focused on it. The blip appeared again for a moment and vanished. He said, ""Probably interference or clutter. These radars are very sensitive. If it were a real cloud, it would be much clearer than this, and it would remain stable.""

His words were logical. But my heart was heavy. I kept my eye on the radar every few minutes. The blip was still appearing and disappearing, but I started to feel like it was... getting closer. Very slowly, but closer.

About ten more minutes later, the blip became a bit clearer on the radar. Still intermittent, but clearer. Captain Arthur noticed it too. We didn't speak, but we looked at each other. A look of unspoken questions and suppressed anxiety.

""Could it be another aircraft not visible on the TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) for some reason?"" I asked, trying to find a logical explanation.

""Unlikely. But let's contact Air Traffic Control and ask,"" Captain Arthur said.

We contacted the nearest air traffic control center and asked if there was any unidentified air traffic in our vicinity, especially behind us to the left. The response was a firm negative. The airspace around us was completely clear in the sector we were inquiring about.

At that moment, the anxiety began to transform into another feeling... a sense of strangeness. As if something wasn't right.

Captain Arthur, with his experience, tried changing the radar frequency, zooming in and out, hoping for a clearer picture. But to no avail. It remained a mysterious blip, slowly but steadily approaching.

I told him, ""Captain, I'm [REDACTED_NAME] to look out the window again. This time, I'll focus very carefully.""
""Easy does it,"" he said, his eyes on the instruments.

I got up again, trying to look further and more intently. The sky was still black and full of stars. But this time... this time I saw something. Something at the very edge of my vision. A blackness within the black. As if a piece of the sky... was erased. A patch devoid of stars. A patch that was moving.

I quickly returned to my seat, my heart pounding hard. ""Captain... there's something. Something huge and black. There are no stars in that area at all. Just like the man said.""

Captain Arthur raised an eyebrow and looked at me intently. ""Are you sure? Not an optical illusion?""
""I'm [REDACTED_NAME], Captain. See for yourself.""

Captain Arthur cautiously got up and looked out the window. He looked for a while, then returned to his seat in complete silence. His face... had changed. His expression indicated he'd seen something he hadn't wanted to believe.

""Did you see it?"" I asked in a low voice.
He nodded slowly. ""I saw it.""

The silence that fell upon the cockpit this time was different. It wasn't the silence of contemplation; it was the silence of... dread. We were both professional pilots, believers in science and logic. But what we were seeing had no logical explanation.

Suddenly, the intercom buzzed again. This time, the flight attendant's voice was very shaky, as if she was crying. ""Captain... the man... the man suddenly calmed down completely. He's sitting in his seat, looking out the window, and smiling a very strange smile. And he's saying... he's saying, 'They've seen it now. Now it's their turn to act correctly.'""

Captain Arthur and I looked at each other. Those words hit us like a thunderbolt. Did this man know we would see it? And did he know what we were supposed to do?

Captain Arthur, despite everything happening, maintained his composure. He picked up the intercom handset and told the flight attendant, ""Listen to me carefully. I want that man to speak to us again. Immediately.""

A few seconds later, the man's choked voice came through again, but this time it was unnervingly calm. ""Yes, Captain.""
Captain Arthur said, in a voice he tried to keep as normal as possible, ""You... what exactly are you seeing? And what are we supposed to do?""

The man replied with perfect calm, as if explaining a lesson in school: ""You see it now, don't you? The black cloud that swallows the stars. It's behind us, and it's watching us. It's been doing this with other planes for a long time.""

""Other planes?"" I asked quickly. ""What planes?""

""It doesn't matter,"" the man replied. ""What matters now is you. It knows you've seen it. But it's not yet sure you understand its nature. If it senses you're afraid of it, or that you're trying to escape it overtly, it will get closer. And that will be a big problem.""

Captain Arthur said, ""A big problem how? This is just... just a strange atmospheric phenomenon, right?"" He was trying to convince himself more than the man.

The man let out a faint laugh that made the hair on my body stand on end. ""Atmospheric phenomenon? No, Captain. This isn't an atmospheric phenomenon. This is... something else entirely. Something older than the sky itself.""

He paused for a moment, then continued: ""Listen to me very carefully. This is the most important part. You must act as if you see nothing. As if everything is normal. Continue your flight as usual. Same speed, same altitude, same course. Don't make any sudden maneuvers. Don't talk about it on the radio with anyone. Don't let anyone among the passengers or crew, other than myself, of course – and I've understood my role – sense that anything is wrong.""

""How?"" I asked, not understanding. ""How can we act as if we don't see a black monster the size of a small city chasing us?""

""You must,"" he said decisively. ""It's waiting for your reaction. If you ignore it completely, as if it doesn't exist, as if it's just part of the night, it will gradually lose interest in you. It will feel that you're... not a worthy target. Or that you're too foolish to understand the danger.""

His words were insane. But at the same time, the terror that had been in his voice earlier, and the confident calm with which he spoke now, made us... believe him. Or at least, it made us willing to try anything.

Captain Arthur asked him, ""And you... how did you know all this?""

The man fell silent again for long seconds, so long that we thought the line had disconnected. Then he said in a low voice, as if sharing a secret: ""This sky isn't ours alone, Captain. It never has been. Go and ask what really happened to Malaysia Flight 370. Ask seriously, and look beyond the official statements.""

After that sentence, the line disconnected. We tried to call him again, but the flight attendant said he had gone back to looking out the window, wasn't responding to anyone, and still had that strange smile on his face.

Captain Arthur and I sat looking at each other for minutes, trying to process what we had heard. A cloud chasing us, a mysterious passenger telling us to ignore it, and hinting at the fate of the missing Malaysian airliner. It was a nightmare.

But we didn't have the luxury of time. This thing – the cloud or entity or whatever it was – was still behind us. It was now showing more clearly on the radar, and visible to the naked eye from the windows if we looked carefully. It was a huge, black mass, with no distinct features, moving with us at our exact speed, maintaining a constant distance. Stranger still, it made no sound and didn't affect the aircraft's performance or its instruments. It was like... a giant phantom.

Captain Arthur broke the silence: ""We'll do as he said.""
I looked at him, disbelieving. ""Seriously, Captain? We're going to ignore... that?""
""Do you have another solution?"" he asked, looking me straight in the eye. ""If we try to escape, his words might turn out to be true, and things could get worse. If we report it, they'll call us crazy. Let's try it. Act calmly, as if nothing's wrong. And focus on our jobs.""

And indeed, that's what we did. We re-engaged the autopilot and went back to monitoring the instruments as if everything was normal. But of course, it wasn't normal. Every few seconds, I would involuntarily glance at the radar screen, or try to catch a glimpse of the edge of this thing from the window. My heart was beating so violently I could hear it in my ears. Sweat drenched me, even though the cockpit air conditioning was working fine.

An hour passed. An hour of silent terror. An hour of us pretending not to see the monster stalking us in the darkness of the sky. Every minute felt like a year. I felt the eyes of that thing on us, studying us, waiting for any wrong move.

Captain Arthur was incredibly composed. He spoke to me in a normal voice about routine flight matters, as if he genuinely hadn't noticed anything. I tried to play along, but my voice came out shaky despite myself.

Suddenly, I noticed something on the radar. The black spot... was starting to move away. Very slowly at first, then its speed increased slightly. I looked out the window cautiously. The black mass was still there, but it was indeed starting to shrink, as if it were retreating.

I said in a hushed voice, ""Captain... it's moving away.""
Captain Arthur looked at the radar, then out the window. He didn't try to hide the flicker of hope that appeared in his eyes. ""Let's keep an eye on it. And do nothing different.""

We maintained our course. Another half hour, and the thing was receding further and further. Until it disappeared completely from the radar screen. We looked out the windows; there was no trace of it. The sky was perfectly clear again, the stars shining as if nothing had happened.

A feeling of relief, mixed with disbelief, flooded the cockpit. We sighed in unison. It was as if a mountain had been lifted from our chests.

Captain Arthur said, his voice still bearing a trace of tension, ""Thank God. We made it through.""
""Thank God,"" I replied, still not quite comprehending.

The rest of the flight passed uneventfully, at least outwardly. But of course, it wasn't uneventful for us. Every so often, we'd check the radar, peer out the windows, as if afraid this thing might return.

As we approached Cairo and began our descent procedures, Captain Arthur asked the flight attendant to check on that strange man. The flight attendant replied that he was asleep! Sleeping soundly and very peacefully, as if nothing had happened.

When we landed safely at the airport, and I was shutting down the engines, Captain Arthur said, ""We have to see this man and talk to him. We need to understand more from him.""

As soon as the passengers began to disembark, we also quickly left the aircraft and stood by the exit door, waiting for him. The flight attendants were with us, also wanting to see him. All the passengers disembarked, one after another. Young people, old people, families, children... but there was no sign of that man.

We were very surprised. We asked the lead flight attendant, ""Did he get off? Are you sure you saw him disembark?""
She said, as puzzled as we were, ""I was standing at the door the whole time, Captain. I didn't see him get off. But I also didn't see him get up from his seat after he woke up shortly before landing! He was sitting in seat number X, by the window.""

We hurried to look at the seat she mentioned. The seat was empty. There was no trace of him. No bag, no jacket, nothing to indicate anyone had been sitting there at all.

We looked at each other in shock. How? How could a passenger just disappear from an airplane? Did he deplane with the other passengers, and we just missed him? Impossible. We were paying very close attention. Did he... was he never even there? No, we spoke to him, saw him on the surveillance cameras. And the flight attendants interacted with him.

We checked the passenger manifest. The name corresponding to that seat was a very ordinary name, nothing remarkable about it. Airport security thoroughly searched the aircraft after we told them the story (of course, we didn't tell them about the cloud, just that a passenger had been causing a disturbance and had disappeared). They found no trace of him. It was as if he had… simply dissolved into thin air.

To this day, Captain Arthur – who became more like a brother to me after what happened – and I can find no logical explanation for that night. Who was that man? And what was the cloud or the thing that was following us? And how did he know all that? And why did he disappear in that manner?

Whenever I look at the night sky, especially on long flights over remote areas, I feel like eyes are watching us from the darkness. And I remember that man's words: ""This sky isn't ours alone."" That sentence keeps ringing in my ears. And I always ask myself, what really happened to Flight 370? And how many other flights have gone through the same experience, with no one ever knowing?. 

If any of you have any explanation, or have experienced something similar, please share it. I need to understand. I need to know I'm [REDACTED_NAME] crazy.

Sorry for the length, but I needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for listening.",1178
1dc9tbk,1717982972.0,2024-06-10 01:29:32,stories,He cheated on me with a minor…,"So I (20f) have been dating my boyfriend, Daniel (24m) for 8 months.

These past months have been hard on our relationship. I thought that finals and school was stressing us both out, and i thought summer we’d finally relax and our relationship would bounce back, turns out Daniel has actually just been in the habit of doing minors.

One of these girls knocked on my door. This girl was clearly very nervous and her face was red and clamy and I didn’t know what to think. She asked if i was my name, when i said yes, she like started crying and handed me this like manilla envelope and explained that her and my boyfriend had been dating for a month and that she stumbled onto his main account, had her older sister follow him, and saw me on there and had no idea I existed.

The girl went on to explain how she got cheated on once and wouldn’t wish it on anyone, and in the envolope was printed out messages and explicit pics of him.

Then the girl begged me not call the police and to just confront him because her parents would do something. 

She left and I was like floored. I felt like i wasn’t myself, i didn’t know what to say or do, but now i think im in the raging bitch phase so i sent his d pic to his family groupchat along with some of the messages and turned off my phone. 

I’m typing this on my computer, can’t wait to turn on my phone tommorow morning. Fuck you Daniel.

Edit:

Woahhhh. I did not expect this to reach the amount of people it did. So let me back track a bit.

Okay first, i did not send only his d pics to his mom 😭 I sent all messages and stuff i got, pictures and all. 

Secondly, weird men messaging, leave me alone please 🙏 no i don’t want to mess around, no i don’t want to talk…

Third, yes I did drop off the messages to the police department this morning, they were busy and just asked for my number to call me, so don’t know if that was how thay was supposed to go.

Now for my favorite part, this morning I woke up to Daniel in my kitchen, in only his boxers, crying on the floor like a child, saying i ruined his life and how i was a spiteful bitch. 

I laughed at Daniel and once he started yelling I called my brother and he already knew about the entire thing, so he dragged Dan out of the house and left him in the yard. 

I don’t know where Daniel went, but I don’t know if this is the end. I’ll see what else that fucking idiot does 💗

I went to school and when I arrived home, I talked to my parents a bit, before remembering I need to put something upstairs into my room. 

I walk into my room, and on my dressing table next to some random rubbish, I see a blue and yellow “tingly” bottle of lube. I take a video on my phone laughing at it before going downstairs and telling my mum she left something in my room. 
 
When my dad asked what it was when my mum came back downstairs, she replied with “oh just a moisturiser.” 

Yeah no.

EDIT:

My mum was in my room because she was emptying all the bins in my house (when I got home my room was clean) and there was also other random rubbish on my desk next to the lube. 

My guess is that she was clearing rubbish out of her room and left in on my room while tidying it, meaning to throw it away with the rest of the rubbish on my table. 

When I went back to my room after, I heard my parents laughing so I’m guessing she told my dad, but was just too embarrassed to say it infront of me and my dad. 

I just want to clear up that I posted this due to finding it slightly amusing and thought others would too.
